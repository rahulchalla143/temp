According to reports from the nursing home she was noted to have worsening dyspnea with O2 saturation of 86% on room air.
She had a chest xray that did not show any evidence of infiltrate.
Of note, she had a recent admission from [**2156-4-23**] - [**2156-4-29**] for ulcerative colitis flare and C.diff.
She had ABG showing hypercarbia and acidosis and was cocnerned that becoming progressively tachypnic with increased work of breathing.
She had a CTA to r/o PE which did not show any evidence of pulmonary embolism or pneumonia.
She was initially sedated with propfol after intubation and became hypotensive to 80's / 40, given IV bolus, switched to Versed IV which also caused hypotension.

[**2156-5-24**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 125 bpm, occasional PAC's, poor baseline, normal axis, normal intervals, no ST segment or T wave changes .
Imaging: [**2156-5-24**] CXR (prelim) - ET tube 5cm above carina, NGT coiled in stomach, hyperinflation bilaterally with flattening of diaphragms, no evidence of frank consolidation or effusion.
[**2156-5-24**] Abd Xray (prelim) - limited, poor quality exam, non-diagnostic for free air.
[**2156-5-24**] CXR (prelim) hyperinflated, flattening of diaphragms c/w copd, lucency below L hemidiaphragm, density at Left lung base suggestive of infection .
[**2156-5-24**] CTA (prelim): No PE or evidence of PNA.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is trivial functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 3 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
**FINAL REPORT [**2156-5-28**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2156-5-28**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Brief Hospital Course: #Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Secondary to COPD exacerbation in the setting of URI or pneumonia with a lesser component of pulmonary edema.
A TTE was performed on [**5-25**] to evaluate cardiac function in light of a concern for volume overload, which showed moderate pulmonary HTN and preserved biventricular systolic function.
Following extubation, the patient was increasingly uncomfortable and tachypneic with a rising oxygen requirement.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Hypercarbic respiratory failure 2) Acute on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 3) Ulcerative colitis 4) Hypertension  Discharge Condition: Expired.
