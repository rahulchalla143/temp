Admission Date:  [**2119-5-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2119-6-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2045-6-9**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year old male with the diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy who awoke on the morning of admission and presented to an outside hospital.
He had previously been seen as an outpatient for shortness of breath one week ago and was diagnosed with CHF exacerbation at which time his Lasix dose had been doubled and resulted in a 6 pound weight loss over two days.
In the emergency room at the outside hospital he was given 80 mg IV of Lasix which resulted in hypotension and tachycardia with minimal urine output.
History of postoperative myocardial infarction after surgery.
Diabetes type 2 recently started on glipizide.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post repair.
Colon cancer status post resection and diverting colostomy in [**2084**].
Congestive heart failure with EF of approximately 15% attributed to ischemia.
Renal insufficiency baseline creatinine approximately 2 to 2.5.
Known 100% occluded left carotid artery.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
History of rheumatoid arthritis and coronary artery disease.
Neck normal carotid upstroke, bounding carotid pulses, engorged EJV with JVD up to 10 cm, no thyromegaly, no lymphadenopathy.
Chest diffuse expiratory wheezes plus rales left greater than right half way up lung fields.
Heart tachycardiac, regular, [**4-6**] holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border, left ventricular heave.
Extremities positive cyanosis bilateral lower extremities, dopplerable pulses, 2 to 3+ pitting edema up to mid-shin, no clubbing.
EKG was v-paced with 100% capture rate of 115 with magnet rate of 60, sinus tachycardia with left bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with preserved redistribution, no infiltrates, blunting of costophrenic angle on right.
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
There were no ischemic issues during this hospitalization.
The patient arrived in congestive heart failure exacerbation.
An echo to evaluate for possible cardioversion showed an apical thrombus, thus, cardioversion was contraindicated.
EP was also consulted and recommended discontinuation of amiodarone as atrial fibrillation had occurred while on this medication.
In addition, low dose digoxin was added for further rate control and augmentation of cardiac output.
The patient came in in acute on chronic renal failure.
This was felt to be secondary to heart failure exacerbation with pre-renal failure.
Of note, during attempted placement of a right subclavian line, a large hematoma of his neck formed with tracheal compression.
Otolaryngology was consulted and did not feel there was a risk of airway compromise.
The hematoma slowly improved without further management.
There were no GI issues.
The patient was started on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation with apical thrombus.
In addition, his hematocrit declined and he needed to be transfused during the hospitalization to maintain hematocrit above 28 as he has known heart failure and coronary artery disease.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to acute rehab as he was significantly decompensated from this hospitalization and heart failure exacerbation.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  During rehab at home he should closely follow his 2 gm sodium diet and fluid restriction to less than 2 liters per day as well as he should weigh himself daily and if there is a gain of greater than 1 kg or any new shortness of breath or increased lower extremity edema, his cardiologist or PCP should be [**Name (NI) 653**] immediately for management to reduce the risk of further congestive heart failure exacerbation requiring hospitalization.
CHF exacerbation.
Atrial fibrillation.
Apical thrombus.
Acute on chronic renal failure.
Diabetes type 2.
Coronary artery disease.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Anemia thought to be secondary to renal failure.
