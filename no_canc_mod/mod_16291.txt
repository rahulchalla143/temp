Differential considerations include subacute subarachnoid hemorrhage or focal meningitis.
Areas of negative susceptibility with enhancement in the cerebral sulci in the right frontal and the parietal lobes, raises the possibility of hemorrhage, with or without superimposed inflammation/infection related to cerebritis or meningitis.
No acute infarction.
Associated cerebral edema involving the right cerebral hemisphere as described above.
No mass effect.
Patent major intracranial arteries without obvious evidence of aneurysm.
Patent major dural venous sinuses.
Evidence of high attenuation in the right-sided cerebral sulci, which can relate to hemorrhage or enhancement from prior gadolinium administration, which may relate to leptomeningeal enhancement related to cerebritis or meningitis.
Effacement of the cerebral sulci with associated edema on the right side, as seen on the prior study.
Patent major intra- and extra-cranial arteries without focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm.
3 Prominent nasopharyngeal soft tissues, and tonsils, which can be correlated with direct visualization, with narrowing of the oropharynx.
Mild right maxillary sinus disease.
Conventional Angiogram on [**9-16**]: (prelim impression by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] Mild beading of multiple distal vessels in the right MCA territory.
No aneurysm or dissection or other vascular malformation seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 31 year-old G3P3 woman with a history of hypothyroidism who delievered her baby on [**9-6**] and then on [**9-14**] had onset of a severe bifrontal headache, associated with photo- and phonophobia, nausea and vomiting, over a period of 30 minutes.
On arrival, the patient's exam was notable for hypertension.
She was felt to have normal cognition, mild photophobia, and no meningismus.
Laboratory results were remarkable for elevated LFTs (normal on [**9-3**]), with normal platelets.
CT brain was suggestive of a small right frontal, parietal, temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
LP  was consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage ([**Numeric Identifier **] RBCs in Tube 4).
She underwent conventional angiogram which did not show an aneurysm or AVM.
Given the improvement in symptoms and lack of findings on neurologic exam, she was discharged with plans for follow-up in the stroke clinic.
It was felt that the patient's presentation was most consistent with post partum cerebral angiopathy (otherwise known as Call [**Doctor Last Name 8271**] syndrome).
Much less likely would be thrombosis of a small cortical vein then leading to right-sided subarachnoid hemorrhage.
She was started on verapamil SR 180mg daily to prevent vasospasm from the SAH.
Disp:*17 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Post-partum cerebral angiopathy (Call-[**Doctor Last Name 8271**] Syndrome) Subarachnoid hemorrhage Migraine headaches.
Discharge Condition: Normal neurological examination   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a severe headache and found to have a small amount of bleeding on top of your brain in the subarachnoid space.
This was likely due to abnormal narrowing of your blood vessels related to pregnancy and your history of migraines.
Difficulty speaking, visual loss, numbness, tingling or weakness or any other concerning symptoms.
