# Severe sepsis:  Patient admitted to the ICU from the ED on levophed for BP support.
Urosepsis was most likely, as patient had a UA in the ED with WBCs, leukesterase positive and with many bacteria.
The first culture grew three equal colonies of GNR suspected to be fecal contamination, but notably this culture was drawn from her foley.
Also concern for cellulitis(see below) Her leg pain and erythema after she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin/ciprofloxacin) kmproved.
When she completed her abx she had another fever and ID was consulted, recommending course of augmentin and doxycycline for 10 day course to be completed [**8-31**].
# Bilateral lower extremity lymphedema with superimposed cellulitis: In the MICU, it was unclear whether her leg edema and erythema was consistent with chronic venous stasis with worsening lymphedema vs. cellulitis.
# Atrial fibrillation: She continues to have Afib with rate of 90-100 in the ICU.
She has been on coumadin at home, originally for history of DVT (distant past) and for atrial fibrillation.
Elevated INR likely secondary to infection.
Because this level was close to therapeutic and her CHADS2 score was low, the patient was d/c on coumadin 2.5mg daily with no further heparin.
Will have biweekly INR checks at [**Hospital1 1501**]  #Flash pulmonary edema: Pt developed transient respiratory distress twice in the ICU, in the context of holding home lasix and bolusing IV fluids to treat early sepsis.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation without ST or T changes.
Serial enzymes negative.
# Normocytic anemia: Stable at 26, down from 31 at admission, likely dilutional.
No evidence of active bleeding at this time.
