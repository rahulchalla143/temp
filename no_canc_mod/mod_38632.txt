Admission Date:  [**2138-8-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-9-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-4-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Dilaudid  Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: 69yo M PMHx Severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9cm2), s/dCHF (EF 20% [**8-/2138**]), recurrent L-sided pleural effusion attributed to CHF, AV node dysfunction s/p PPM ([**2-/2138**]), COPD, CKD, and multiple recent hospital stays for shortness of breath, notable for CABG/AVR w/u but subsequent refusal of surgical intervention, now presenting with SOB.
Patient reports SOB has been worsening since discharge 1d prior to this presentation.
Labs were significant for WCC 11.5 (6.1 at discharge), Hct 31.1, Cr 3.8 (3.7 at discharge), CXR demonstrated fluid overload w stable large L pleural effusion.
Patient was admitted to medicine for further management of shortness of breath.
Patient denied any pain or discomfort, but his tachypnea interfered w conducting a full review of systems.
On the day of admission the pt was transferred to the CCU due to concern for evolving sepsis in the setting of likely PNA and CHF exacerbation.

Microbiology: No growth on multiple blood, urine, or pleural fluid cultures.
CXR ([**2138-9-1**]): Interval increase in size of a now large left pleural effusion with associated bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and moderate edema.
There is pulmonary edema which may be slightly increased.
Right lung is well aerated with persistent left basilar opacity, probably a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis or consolidation.
Persistent opacity at the left lung base with mild increase in pulmonary edema.
TTE [**2138-9-8**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation of anterior septal and basal inferolateral contraction.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with depressed free wall contractility.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.9cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (multivessel CAD, toxin, metabolic, etc.).
Severe aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate aortic regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
The gradient across the aortic valve is increased with similar aortic valve area.
The severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly increased.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 69yo M PMHx Severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2, peak gradient 66mmHg), s/dCHF (EF 20%), recurrent L-sided pleural effusion attributed to CHF, AV node dysfunction s/p PPM ([**2-/2138**]), COPD, CKD, and multiple recent hospital stays for shortness of breath, notable for CABG/AVR w/u but subsequent refusal of surgical intervention, now presenting with SOB.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: # Shortness of Breath: Pt with s/d CHF (EF 20% [**8-/2138**]), critical AS (valve area 0.9 cm2), as well as recurrent L pleural effusion that has previously been attributed to CHF, presenting w worsening SOB, CXR significant for volume overloaded appearance; most likely etiology is complication of AS.
In the CCU, his pleural effusion was tapped (chemistry consistent with transudative nature with negative statin, culture and cytology).
He was started broad spectrum coverage with vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl for multifocal pneumonia and diuresed with significant improvement in his respiratory symptoms.
He was tranferred to the floor but required readmission to the CCU the following day after an apneic episode believed to be due to ativan.
Pt meets criteria for NYHA class III/IV.
The patient was started on milrinone in the setting of decling renal function which resulted in an EF increase to 25%.
His milrinone was discontinued as was CVVHD, and patient was symptomatically managed for volume overload with lasix and morphine.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure has been worsened in the setting of improved cardiac output with very decreased urine output.
Patient showed signs of uremia with decreased mental status and twitching.
Pt failed a diuretic challenge.
His urine sediment showed muddy brown casts suggesting ATN.
Per renal recommendations patient was started on CVVHD via a R IJ dialysis line with marked improvement in his mental status and uremia.
However, the patient expressed to renal that he did not desire to have further dialysis.
Changes in mental status were thought to be multifocal in nature, including baseline dementia, hospital delirium, uremia in setting of worsening renal function and poor CNS perfusion in setting of severe AS.
As patient became more somnolent, uremia appeared to be a controllable factor as creatinine was climbing with decreasing UOP.
However, patient refused CVVHD and it was discontinued on HD14.
At baseline, pt is combative, so there was to be an underlying psych component superimposed on any organic cause of AMS.
(Patient was agitated and disoriented at that time so was unable to participate.)
[**Name2 (NI) **] remained afebrile, and cultures from pleural fluid, urine, stool, and blood showed no growth.
# CAD: Stable throughout admission without acute EKG changes.
3. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) vial Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for SOB, wheeze.
8. morphine concentrate 100 mg/5 mL (20 mg/mL) Solution Sig: 2.5-5.0 mg PO Q1H (every hour) as needed for SOB or pain.
9. haloperidol 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for agitation.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with pneumonia and congestive heart failure and needed to be on a ventilator to help you breathe while you received antibiotics and diuretics.
AFter speaking with you, the kidney doctors and the cardiac surgeons, it was decided that surgery or long term dialysis would not be an appropriate treatment plan.
