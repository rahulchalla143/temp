Admission Date:  [**2145-6-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-7-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-6-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: AVR(#23CE Magna)MVR(#29StJude Epic)CABGx1(SVG-PDA)[**7-2**]   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 78566**] is a 74 year old male with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM2, aortic stenosis and PVD who presented initially to an OSH on [**2145-6-6**] with complaints of fever, headache, and arthralgias.
Patient was initially felt to have viral meningitis, and was treated broadly with antibiotics.
He had no weight loss, fevers.
He does have chronic neck pain.
At the OSH, patient was febrile to 103.9 with a leukocytosis with bandemia, and blood cultures were positive for staph aureus, and patient was placed on vancomycin, and subsequently transitioned to oxacillin.
Last night, patient developed rigors and oxygen desaturation to 88% on 4L and ruled in for ischemia.
He was felt to have had an anteroseptal MI based on EKG and elevation in troponin.
He was also in atrial fibrillation with RVR and was placed on diltiazem.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He notes fevers and chills.
He notes exertional buttock or calf pain.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
***    Past Medical History: Diabetes mellitus type 2 Dyslipidemia Severe aortic stenosis (Echo [**8-9**] at OSH: EF 65%, [**Location (un) 109**] 0.9, Peak gradient 70) Peripheral arterial disease Hypertension Pancreatitis, alcoholic S/p tonsillectomy.
Hx alcohol abuse  Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension  Cardiac History: No hx CABG, cardiac catheterizations, pacemaker/ICD placement.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
2/6 systolic ejection murmur at RUSB with radiation into carotids.
No rubs or gallops.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Bilateral expiratory wheezing.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
No [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions or Osler nodes.
Pertinent Results: [**6-11**] Head CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or infarction.
There is mild periventricular white matter hypodensity, most consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no fracture.
Mild mucosal thickening is seen in the bilateral maxillary sinuses.
Bilateral cavernous carotid artery calcification is noted.
Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes which are likely reactive.
Extensive aortic valve, coronary artery, and aortic calcifications.
Aneurysmal dilatation up to 3 cm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Emphysematous changes with peripheral ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes, which may represent an inflammatory or infectious process.
No frank consolidation identified.
Splenic infarct.
Differential diagnosis includes recent instrumentation versus UTI.
There was a 14x12 mm mass in the left atrium attached to/involving the base of the posterior mitral valve leaflet.
There was mild enhancement of the mass during first pass perfusion of Gd-DTPA.
Given the location, clinical history, and mild contrast uptake, the mass most likely is a valvular vegetation, but cannot fully exclude a primary tumor (e.g.
atrial myxoma).
The LVEF was mildly decreased at 51%.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonic regurgitation.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate aortic stenosis.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased.
A note is made of moderate bilateral pleural effusions, aortic atherosclerosis, a pre-tracheal lymph node, and possible tracheomalacia.
[**6-25**] Head MRI: Numerous small foci of acute infarction as described above, consistent with embolic infarction.
Infection within these small foci cannot be excluded based on the current study.
No evidence of abscess is seen.
[**7-2**] Echo: Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch and the descending aorta.
Focal calcification is seen at the ST junciton, There are three aortic valve leaflets.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a large vegetation on the mitral valve, encompassing the majority of the posterior leaflet and impeding flow into the left ventricle.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Trace to Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No perivalvular leaks seen.
[**7-6**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**7-5**], there is little change in the moderate right pleural effusion.

He was also admitted for NSTEMI and was treated medically with heparin, ASA, Statin and betablocker.
One week into his admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 78566**] developed chest pain associated with dynamic ST changes and was taken to the cath lab.
He is now status post cardiac cath, which found a filling defect of the distal LAD not intervened upon based on its location.
No intervention was done, as decision was for CABG.
TEE and Cardiac MR showed a vegetation on the Mitral Valve.
Repeat CT scan of Chest/ABD/Pelvis was done which showed increasing splenic infarct but no signs of abscess formation.
Patient's daughter stated that her father had mild mental status changes and was not at his baseline.
This was followed up by an MR of the brain which showed several small infarcts, which are likely due to septic emboli from the vegetation on the mitral valve.
