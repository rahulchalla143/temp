History of Present Illness: 55 year old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (multiple PCI including RCA [**2158**], OM1 [**2160**], LCX [**2160**], LAD [**2163**]), bicuspid aortic valve and moderate aortic stenosis (TTE [**2163**] [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8-1.0cm2, cath [**2163**] gradient 29mm Hg and calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.33 cm2), and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not on coumadin due to bleeding risk, who presents from home following syncopal episode.
He reports, when leaving a friend's house and walking to his car in the cold he developed sudden onset substernal chest pain radiating to shoulder and left arm.
He felt lightheaded and nauseous.
He sat down on the third step of the stairs and then lost consciousness and postural tone.
After the event he felt "out of it," weak, and had difficulty calling EMS for assistance.
He continued to have chest pain.
He notes that his angina (0.5 miles) and syncopal episodes have increased in frequency over the past few months.
He also notes that he has never had syncope at rest, and that is always with exertion and associated with feeling fatigue and weakness prior.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.

There is a mechanical prosthesis in the native aortic position, seated and functioning well with a residual mean gradient of 11 mm of Hg.
Wall motion abnormalities and other valvular findings similar to prebypass.
He developed post-op atrial fibrillation which converted to sinus rhythm with lopressor and amiodarone.
