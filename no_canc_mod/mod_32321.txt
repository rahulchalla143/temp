On the morning of admission, he developed heavy labored breathing and that is what led to him presenting to the ED.

No urinary symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old man with Type I DM presented with DKA.
He had severe DKA with initial VBG pH of 6.87, AG>40, 150 urine ketones.
There was unclear precipitant for DKA, but with history of nausea and vomiting, but we suspected viral gastroenteritis or gastritis from possible EtOH binge ( more likely).
The patient denied missing doses of insulin, and did not have any clear localizing symptoms for infection.
Patient initially had a lactate and large anion gap, which closed with IV fluids and insulin drip.
Upon transfer to floor, patient requested discharge as he was completely asymptomatic and received his regular Insulin home dose with euglycemia.
He no longer have nausea or vomiting.
He was advised to avoid excessive alcohol use as this may lead to dehydration from vomiting and DKA.
# Acute renal failure: On admission, creatinine was elevated to 2.2 from baseline of 0.7.
This is most likely pre-renal failure in setting of severe volume depletion secondary to DKA.
This is most likely dilutional given large volume fluid resuscitation.
However, started on PO PPI given concern for possible gastritis with a plan to guaiac stools when he has bowel movement in the out patient.
No evidence of blood loss clinically.
# EKG changes: Patient had dynamic EKG changes in the inferolateral distribution in setting of tachycardia and hypovolemia in ED.
The patient is high risk for CAD given DM, HTN, and family history, and should be encouraged to undergo risk stratification with TTE or stress as outpatient.
This was communicated to him and he verbalized his understanding to follow up with his PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] stress test.
# Nausea/Vomiting: Possibly EtOH gastritis vs viral gastroenteritis but resolved with IV fluids.
