Admission Date:  [**2182-7-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-7-5**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6088**] Chief Complaint: Left ischemic leg  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Emergent left groin exploration with left femoral embolectomy.
History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female who was recently on a lowered Coumadin dose because of a UTI and antibiotics who presented with acute pain of her left lower extremity.
The patient postoperatively had a hematoma and a groin wound dehiscence but this ultimately closed and granulated well.
No tobacco, EtOH, recreational drugs.
L groin with healed transverse incision, mild erythema, firmness sans fluctuance.
non-tender to touch or passive motion.
Monitored anesthesia care was used and local anesthesia was given after a time-out was performed and vancomycin and gentamicin were given for preoperative antibiotics.
A vertical incision was made in the left groin below the area of the prior transverse incision and this was carried down to identify the superficial femoral artery.
There was extensive scar in the common femoral artery area but ultimately the artery was encircled with vessel loops proximally and the SFA and profunda were encircled with vessel loops.
There was acute thrombus and an embolus sitting in the common femoral artery and this was pulled out and there was excellent forward flow from the external iliac artery which had the clamp released.
A #3 embolectomy catheter was passed down the profunda and there was no evidence of clot.
A #4 [**Doctor Last Name **] embolectomy catheter was passed down the SFA with multiple passes and ultimately a large amount of thrombus was pulled out of the SFA and there was finally good bleeding.
There was noted to be a stenosis at the origin of the SFA, but this was left alone as there was good backbleeding.
All the arteries were flushed and back bled appropriately and after restoration of flow, there was a palpable DP pulse in the foot and the color improved.
Hemostasis was obtained and the wound was closed in layers using 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl and staples for the skin.
She is afebrile and is ambulating with some assistance given her age.
Because of her subtherapeutic INR, she will either need to be 1) placed on Lovenox lifetime without any need for warfarin or 2) Lovenox-Warfarin bridge until her INR is therapeutic.
Ambulate as much as possible with assistance.
