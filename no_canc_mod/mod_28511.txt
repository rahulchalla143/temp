SAH REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: brain MRI +/- gado to rule out tumor CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with question of rule out tumor.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images obtained before gadolinium.
FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
The ventricles and extraaxial spaces are normal in size without midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
There are no focal signal abnormalities within the brain.
Following gadolinium, no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular, or meningeal enhancement identified.
IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities detected on MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with question of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Patient had migraines with positive LP and fever of 104 degrees.
3D reformatted images were acquired.
FINDINGS HEAD CT:  Head CT demonstrates normal ventricles and extraaxial spaces without midline shift, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or hemorrhage.
No evidence of vascular occlusion, stenosis, or an aneurysm identified.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) 18394**] [**Name (STitle) 18395**] DR. [**First Name (STitle) 3905**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3906**]    MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] with and without contrast [**2155-9-14**]: IMPRESSION:  No significant abnormalities detected on MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium.
No discrete fluid collections concerning for abscesses are seen.
Less likely possibility is calcific tendinitis of the longus [**Last Name (un) **] muscle.
No enhancing masses or obvious vascular lesions of the cord or spine.
Mild canal stenosis due to degenerative changes at C6/7.
Mild degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine with epidural lipomatosis of the lower lumbar spine as described above.
Portable CXR [**2155-9-16**]: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia or any other major cardiovascular abnormality on single-view chest examination with patient in semi-erect position.
No ultrasonographic findings to suggest pyelonephritis; however, normal ultrasound does not rule out this entity.
Tagged WBC scan [**2155-9-19**]: Normal   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was originally admitted to the Neurosurgery service for management of a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Neither subarachnoid blood nor a vascular anomaly was not seen on the MRI imaging of the entire neuroaxis.
The patient had a post lumbar puncture headache from the outside hospital.
It was ultimately felt that the  patient's months long headache course was likely related to analgesia rebound phenomenon - taking too many pain medications and requiring more and more to quell the headaches as the tissues that respond to the medications learn to require more and more of them.
The patient developped a fever of 102.6 on the fourth day of admission.
Outpatient Physical Therapy Lower back pain with radiculopathy from disc - needs physical therapy 4.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Menthol-Cetylpyridinium 3 mg Lozenge Sig: One (1) Lozenge Mucous membrane every four (4) hours as needed for pain: for sore throat.
UTI and retropharngeal collection   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable.
The patient has no objective neurological deficit.
Please come back to the hospital if you should have severe headache, blurry vision, nausea, vomiting, severe light sensitivity or any other concerning neurological symptoms.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 68568**], your PCP in the next 2 weeks and share with him the plan that we made for you regarding the pain medication.
