In a visit to his cardiologist in [**2154**] the patient was noted to have AFib with an echo showing mitral valve prolapse.
In [**2157-6-28**], the patient developed a progressive cough, and in [**Month (only) 216**] he developed progressive shortness of breath and CHF.
At that time, a cardiac cath done in [**2158-2-28**] supported a diagnosis of severe mitral regurgitation and found no coronary artery disease.
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**4-13**] for management of his congestive heart failure as well as evaluation for transplant.
The patient's cath done on the [**4-11**] showed 4+ MR, with an EF of 50%, with severe pulmonary hypertension, mild MS, and no coronary artery disease.
An echo done on [**2158-2-11**] showed an EF of 60%, with partial mitral valve flail and thickening of the mitral valve chordae, 3+ MR with no mitral stenosis, 2+ TR with a dilated right and left atrium, and severe pulmonary systolic hypertension.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, basal cell CA of the chest, lactose intolerance, allergic rhinitis.
ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with CAD with a MI in early 30s.
REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  Significant for a history of congestive heart failure, 3-pillow orthopnea, history of anxiety and panic attacks.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Includes a height of 5 feet 10.5 inches and weight of 159 pounds.
In general, in no acute distress.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
The extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema bilaterally.
The neck is supple with no carotid bruits, and JVD sitting bolt upright.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  A cardiac MR done on the [**4-5**] showed a forward left ventricular EF of 17% with posterior mitral valve prolapse, partial flailed leaflets, severe MR, severe biatrial enlargement.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated, initially the patient was admitted preoperatively for management of his congestive heart failure as well as a transplant workup.
He was subsequently found to have a UTI which was treated with Levaquin.
Ultimately, on the [**4-21**], he was brought to the operating room for mitral valve repair plus or minus replacement.
In summary, the patient underwent a mitral valve repair with a 30-mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] annuloplasty band and a quadrangular resection of the posterior leaflet.
However, given the severity of his CHF preoperatively it was decided to keep the patient sedated and ventilated throughout the night of surgery.
Additionally, the patient's Levophed infusion was weaned to off, and he was noted to have transient periods of atrial fibrillation.
On postoperative day 3, the patient was started on an ACE inhibitor as well as beta blockers, and anticoagulation was started given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation.
Incision with Steri-Strips without drainage or erythema.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
The extremities are warm and well perfused with no edema.
Atrial fibrillation.
Basal cell carcinoma of the chest.
Allergic rhinitis.
