There is mild fluid overload.
There are no ____ pleural effusions.
Small atelectasis in the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac area is new.
There is no pneumothorax.
Diffusely echogenic liver, consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease, including significant hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
No acute intracranial process.
Likely small arachnoid cyst in the left temporal region.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: Ms. [**Known lastname 45810**] is a 59 yo female s/p CCY who presents with seizure activity, fever, and ARF .
Platelets were reduced by 50% on repeat CBC and hematocrit dropped by 10 points; however, there was no evidence of schistocytes on peripheral smear.
Neurologic exam reported as normal by neurology consult, and non-contrast head CT negative for bleed or obvious seizure focus.
Differential included EtOH withdrawl, infection, vs. other toxic-metabolic process.
Admission labs were also notable for multiple electrolyte derangements, including ARF, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia.
Prior discharge summary invoked possible h/o alcohol abuse, and serum ethanol level were negative at time of admission, supporting possible delirium tremens, although patient denied EtOH use on both occasions consistently.
She had two further episodes of generalized tonic clonic activity in the ED and was subsequently confused.
She was placed on a CIWA scale for possible EtOH withdrawal, but had very low scores.
LFTs remained abnormal as well as thyroid function tests which are both further areas of exploration for inciting event for new seizures.
2) Acute Renal Failure: Upon admission, her creatinine was 2.9, with no known h/o renal insufficiency.
She was treated with IVFs as this was felt to be due to possible rhabdomyolysis, and creatinine now improved to 0.9. .
3) Transaminitis: Upon admission, she had elevated LFTs, with AST>ALT, suggestive of alcohol use.
RUQ ultrasound notable only for echogenic fatty liver.
Also, ferritin was found to be persistently elevated at >[**2103**], so hemochromatosis should also be excluded as an outpatient.
Iron studies showed as above a very high ferritin and also low B12.
Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies as well as H. pylori serologies were sent; H. pylori antibody was equivocal and anti-IF antibodies were pending at discharge.
5) FEN/GI: the patient had multiple electrolyte abnormalities at admission.
Senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Generalized tonic clonic seizure 2) Hypertension 3) Abnormal thyroid tests 4) hypercholesterolemia 5) Transaminitis   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after having several seizures.
You were started on a new medication called Keppra to prevent recurrence of seizures.
In particular, you will need to have further workup of your liver and thyroid function.
