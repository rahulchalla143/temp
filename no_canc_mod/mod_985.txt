Admission Date:  [**2137-6-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-6-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-12-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ibuprofen  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation [**2137-6-21**].
History of Present Illness: 81 y/o F with history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diagnosed by lung (on home O2 3 L with rest 6L with ambulation), severe pHTN, AFib who presented to OSH on [**6-18**] with worsening SOB x 1 week.
The patient underwent a CTA of the chest that revealed no PE, moderate b/l pleural effusion, ?
EKG at OSH also showed ST depression in the lateral leads, and patient's Troponins bumped from .39 to 7.
By this morning ST depressions in these were less, but still present.
She had an echo earlier today which showed LVH and an EF of 60%, with RVSP of 69.
She was also found to have guiac positive stool and recieved 2 units of blood earlier this morning (Hct 25.4 to 35.2 post transfusion).
She arrived on a heparin drip and had no complaints of chest pain or SOB.
Past Medical History: IPF on home O2 (3-6L) Pulmonary hypertension Atrial fibrillation on rate control Hypertension Hyperlipidemia PVD s/p aortobifem bypass in [**2126**] with R femoral thrombectomy and L femoral thromboendarterectomy GERD CAD, but no prior MI or cardiac catheterization.
Retired floral designer with no industrial exposure.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 96.8 HR 92 BP 117/52 RR 16 O2 95% 3 L NCGeneral: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP 8 cm, no LAD Lungs: Inspiratory velcro-like Crackles 2/3 up b/l CV: Regular rate and rhythm, III/VI holosystolic murmur loudest at RUSB Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: [**2137-6-21**] Echo: IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-1-4**], the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is now identifeid.
The severity of mitral regurgitation has also increased.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has moderate aortic stenosis.
Based on [**2132**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is asymptomatic, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**12-15**] years.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
# Respiratory Failure: Pt with underlying end stage IPF on home oxygen admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress.
Pt had sputum cultures, viral cultures, BAL for thorough workup of pulmonary process.
BAL showed alveolar hemorrhage.
Hemorrhage most likely [**1-15**] anticoagulation during treatment of NSTEMI (see below).
#Atrial Fibrillation: Pt had atrial fibrillation s/p intubation.
Anticoagulation was discontinued secondary to anemia and hemoptysis.
# NSTEMI Patient had ST depressions in anterior lateral leads and troponin spike to 7.56, likely NSTEMI.
Cardiology was consulted and did not catheterize given patient's instability and inability to go on anticoagulation due to hemoptysis and GI bleed.
Echo showed moderate LV systolic dysfunction and worsening AS.
# Guiac positive stool and anemia.

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis 2.

After about five days of these treatments, your breathing and your cough began to improve.
