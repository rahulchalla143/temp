Expected postoperative changes of aortic aneurysm repair with no evidence of leak.
New elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
No evidence of herniation of the stomach into the thorax.
Most of this is due to persistent moderate left pleural effusion, and although I don't think there is collapse of the left lower lobe, there must be appreciable atelectasis in order to produce left rather than right mediastinal shift.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2120-1-16**] IMPRESSION: Large thoracoabdominal aneurysm measuring 6.9 x 6.6 cm at the widest point at the level of the left ventricle.
Aneurysmal dilatation is markedly ectatic particularly within the lower thorax.
There is no CT evidence of acute rupture.
[**2120-1-29**] 6:50 PM  ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  THREE VIEWS OF THE ABDOMEN: Just right of the midline, in the mid abdomen, a dilated loop of small bowel is again identified.
However, the number and degree of dilated small bowel loops is decreased since the radiograph obtained two days prior.
No abnormal air- fluid levels are identified.
The lung bases demonstrate a left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
The left heart border is obscured, likely by a left lower lobe consolidation.
Surgical clips in the thorax and upper abdomen are indicative of prior surgery.
Left pleural effusion and consolidation, likely atelectasis alone, but superimposed infection is possible.
Brief Hospital Course: CTA showing a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm measuring 6.9 x 6.6 cm at the widest point at the level of the left ventricle.
Aneurysmal dilatation is markedly ectatic particularly within the lower thorax.
There is no CT evidence of acute rupture.
Patient was transfused with red blood cells for low HCT.

KUB showing-Mild dilatation of small bowel loops, consistent with ileus, better on [**1-29**] KUB.
No urinary problems after.
