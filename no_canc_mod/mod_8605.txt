Admission Date:  [**2104-11-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-11-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Epinephrine / Amiodarone / Ambien  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to left circumflex artery, balloon catheterization to OM branch   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 25866**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD s/p multiple PCIs most recently in [**4-21**], ischemic cardiomyopathy with an LVEF 25-30%, PAF, and CVA transferred from an OSH for cardiac catheterization after VF arrest.
The patient initially presented to OSH on [**2104-11-8**] with chest pain.
Per review of records, the chest pain woke him from sleep at 2 am described as [**8-22**] epigastric pain and did not improve with SL NTG.
He then was taken to an OSH ED, where he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR with lateral STD.
While in the OSH ED, he developed [**11-22**] left-sided chest pain different from intial chest pain that resolved with NTG and morphine.
His labs at that time were notable for elevated cardiac biomarkers to CK 42, MB 3.1, TnT 0.22.
In addition, the patient was also admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-20**] for chest pain that resolved without intervention.
Currently, the patient is resting comfortably without complaints.
Denies CP/SOB, f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain, HA, palpitations, pain radiating to jaw, arms, or back.
ROS: As above, he denies change in weight or bowel habit, cough, fever, arthralgias or myalgias.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - CAD: PCI history *[**4-21**] PTCA OM & PTCA/DES to LCx *[**7-19**] BMS LCx *[**4-14**] PTCA LAD *[**12-14**] PTCA/stenting proximal and mid-LAD .
- Ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 25-30% - Aortic regurg (2+ by [**7-19**] TTE) - Atrial fibrillation - LBBB .
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: L CVA w/o residual deficit [**2084**] Microcytic anemia b/l Hct ~34% Hypothyroidism Depression GERD   Social History: Retired chemist and inventor.
Able to ambulate independently and accomplish all ADLs without difficulty.
Has a glass of wine each day.
No illicit substances.
Family History: HTN in mother, died of MI at 49; , polycythemia in father (may have been related to benzine exposure in shoe industry), died of  stroke at 72; sister with CAD.
CXR [**11-12**]: Cardiomegaly, mild cephalization.
No effusions or consolidations.
Cardiac Cath [**11-12**] PTCA COMMENTS: initial angiography showed severe diffsue disease throughout the LCX system with new tight lesion just proximal to the stent placed in [**Month (only) **] [**2104**].
The OM branch (was treated with POBA in [**4-21**]) was also diffusely and severely diseased throughout.
A ChoICE PT Extra Support wire crossed the lesion with minimal manipulation and positioned into the distal AV groove LACX.
The proximal LCX stent was predilated with a 2.5x12 mm Quantum Maverick RX at 12 ATM x2 followed by deployment of a 2.5x15 mm Promus RX DES at 12 ATm, postdilated with a 2.75x8 mm Quantum Maverick balloon at 22 ATM.
We then advanced the wire into the jailed OM branch and performed several POBAs starting with a 2.0x12 mm Voyager RX at 6-12 ATM followed by 2.76x15 mm Quantum maverick balloon (at 6-8 ATM), each left up for 30-45 seconds.
Final angiography showed excellent flow into the LCX system with 0% residual stenosis within the stent and 40% residual stenosis in the OM branch (due to rapid recoil).
No apparent dissection or distal emboli.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 25866**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG and multiple PCIs most recently in [**4-21**], ischemic cardiomyopathy with an LVEF 25%, PAF, and [**Hospital **] transferred from an OSH for cardiac catheterization after VF arrest.
Underwent cardiac cath with DES to LCx proximal to prior stent, but etiology of VF arrest unclear, possible ischemic vs. prolonged QT from Citalopram.
# Coronaries: Patient with severe CAD s/p CABG with OSH diagnostic cardiac catheterization demonstrating possible in-stent restenosis of OM 1 after recent PCI with in-hospital VF arrest at OSH concerning for ischemic event.
Unclear if LCX lesion led to arrhythmias.
# Pump: Patient with known chronic systolic CHF with LVEF 25-30%.
Was euvolemic with minimal pulmonary vascular congestion on CXR and minimal signs of volume overload on exam.
Patient also with VF cardiac arrest at OSH, with longest QTc recorded as 511 msecs prior to VF, 0.48 now in-house.
Possible etiologies to VF arrest include ACS versus R on T with prolonged QTc.
Celexa discontinued for ?QTc prolongation and possible precipitant of VF.
DES to LCx as above for possible ischemic component of VF.
Did not receive Amiodarone as history of pulmonary toxicity.
Pt has outpatient f/u with outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6221**] to assess need for ICD with low EF and s/p VF arrest.
# Hypothyroid: Continued levothyroxine.
Fexofenadine 60 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for allergies.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: 1-2 tablets Sublingual every 5 minutes x2 as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Ischemic Cardiomyopathy with chronic Systolic Dysfunction: EF 30% Ventricular fibrillation Cardiac Arrest Acute Blood Loss Anemia Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation Stroke   Discharge Condition: Medically stable, vitals stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred here for a catheterization because of a dangerous heart rhythm  and chest pain.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 838**] if you have any trouble breathing, chest pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, fevers, swelling in your legs or any ohter concerning symptom.
