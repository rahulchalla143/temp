Admission Date:  [**2186-1-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-1-31**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**] Chief Complaint: Observation s/p trach change  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy change Hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 89yo female with PMH significant for chronic ventilator support, ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, and AS s/p AVR.
The patient was first admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-17**] after she presented to an OSH with ventilator dyssynchrony, thick secretions, increasing peak pressures, and hypoxia.
She was readmitted on [**12-28**] for reoccurring hypoxia.
She underwent flexible bronchoscopy which revealed severe tracheomalacia obstructing her tracheostomy tube.
She was taken back to the OR for insertion of a Y stent across the area of tracheomalacia and her tracheostomy was replaced as well.
Per daughter, the patient has had increased secretions and alarms from the ventilator.
She denies any fevers, chills, dizziness, chest pain, abdominal pain, or any other concerning symptoms.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilator support Tracheal stenosis Chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis Diabetes mellitus (per OSH H+P, daughter denies) COPD (per OSH H+P, daughter denies) Hypertension, but now requires midodrine to maintain BPs s/p CVA (per OSH H+P, daughter denies) Aortic stenosis s/p aortic valve replacement in [**2181**] Hypothyroidism per OSH record however pt.
recently on methimazole Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation CAD Dementia (given med list although daughter denies) Hyperlipidemia CHF Osteoarthritis .
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Worsening of left retrocardiac opacities consistent with again worsened left retrocardiac atelectasis.
No change in the appearance of the endotracheal Y stent is demonstrated.
There is no change in the dialysis central venous line with its tip in the right atrium.
There is no failure.
Bilateral small pleural effusions are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 4318**] is an 89yo female with PMH as listed above who presented for observation after changing of her tracheostomy tube, with course complicated by lung white out, thought secondary to mucus plugging, initiated on antibiotic therapy for presumptive ventilator associated pneumonia.
# Chronic respiratory failure - Patient had tracheostomy tube changed by interventional pulmonology without complication.
Patient had cxr findings of left lung white out with concern for ventilatory associated pneumonia given secretions, and was started initially on vanco and cefepime.
Sputum culture grew pseudomonas sensitive to cefepime and sparse klebsiella bacteria with resistances, without evidence of gram positive cocci.
# Pneumonia - as above, pt p/w sxs of increasing secretions, increased vent alarms per daughter.
# ESRD on HD - patient was on M,W,F schedule, underwent HD during her course without complication.
# Anemia - after speaking with pt's outpatient nephrologist, patient received a uPRBCs for her chronic anemia.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - pt remained in NSR throughout stay.
# Hyperlipidemia - continued Lipitor.
# Dementia - continue Namenda and Aricept.
