She is having progressive difficuly ambulating distances because of neurogenic claudication.
These include but are not limited to bleeding, infection, CSF leak and nerve injury.
Past Medical History: Mumps HTN Mealses Hemorrhoids Arthritis Migraines  Social History: Social alcohol Denies tobacco  Family History: HTN CA Sz Arthritis  Physical Exam: Well developled, well nourished white female with an obvious spinal defomeity with kyphoscolosis.
She has a loss of waist on the right side and a bropad paravertebral prominence on the left.
She has no evidence of hairy patches or dimpling posteriorly or other spinal dysraphism.
She has intermittent sciatica radiating from the right buttock down the leg.
She also complains of some fysethesias in the L5 nerve [**Last Name (un) **] distribution to the right foot.
Negative Babinski's, no clonus and negative [**Doctor Last Name 937**] ssign.
A medicine consult was obtained for volume overload due to intraoperative fluid.
A spiral chest CT was obtained which showed multiple bilateral PE's.
New abnormality in the posterior spinal canal space from T1 through T5 most likely representing hematoma.
Incomplete visualization at L3 which in this clinical setting may also represent hematoma compressing the thecal sac.
Possible paraspinous hematomas or abscess collections especially in the thoracolumbar region.
She was taken back to the OR [**2-4**] for evacuation of hematoma and posterior completion.
[**2-6**] a CT  was obtained which demonstrated multilevel post-surgical changes throughout the entire thoracic and lumbar spines with question of central canal compromise at T10.
The thecal sac and normal bony landmarks are completely not visualized in the region of the T12-L1 vertebral bodies and potential thecal sac compromise cannot be commented upon in this region, as well as in other portions of the spine due to metallic hardware streak artifacts.
Thus, an epidural hematoma within the lumbar spine would be difficult to exclude based on this study.
The CT myleogram showed successful introduction of intrathecal contrast at the level of L5-S1 with demonstration of canal stenosis at L3-4 and at T12.
She remained intubated in the SICU for the next 3 days and began to regain function of her lower extremities.
Mildly dilated RV cavity with normal systolic function.
At least mild pulmonary hypertension.
Moderately dilated ascending thoracic aorta.
