[**2167-4-5**] CXR: Frontal view of the chest compared to prior study from [**2167-4-3**], demonstrates patchy airspace consolidation of both lower lobes, increased from prior study, consistent with pneumonia.
Heart and mediastinum are otherwise within normal limits except for calcified aortic arch.
[**2167-4-6**] EKG - Atrial fibrillation.
Q waves in leads III and aVF with T wave inversion in those leads.
[**2167-4-8**] Scrotal ultrasound: There is a large inguinoscrotal hernia with loops of bowel in the scrotum, markedly displacing the right testicle cephalad and left testicle caudally and anteriorly.
Assessment of intra-testicular arterial flow is somewhat difficult secondary to the moderate displacement by the large hernia.
Venous flow is demonstrated in both testicles, but the left testicle has markedly diminished arterial flow.
Intermittent peristalsis is noted in the herniated bowel loops, and intraluminal bowel gas causes "dirty" shadowing.
However, in a focal region in the left scrotum, dirty shadowing is noted without observable peristalsis.
There is no fluid collection in the scrotum to suggest hematoma or abscess.
The patient did not complain of focal tenderness during the scan.
Large hernia with loops of bowel and fat in the scrotum, displacing the testicles.
No evidence of hematoma or abscess in the scrotum.
A focal area of "dirty" shadowing in the left scrotum, without demonstrable peristalsis, nonspecific and could represent a hypoactive bowel loop with intraluminal bowel gas but cannot completely exclude free gas from bowel perforation.
[**2167-4-9**] Video swallow:Barium passes freely through oropharynx and esophagus without  evidence of obstruction.
There is aspiration and penetration noted with thin  liquids.
Otherwise, there is no gross aspiration or penetration noted with  other consistencies of barium.
There is significant residue and slow swallowing mechanism noted with all consistencies of barium.
[**2167-4-13**] LUE ultrasound Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of the left IJ, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left arm.
[**2167-4-13**] CXR Opacification of the left mid and lower lung has increased compared to [**2167-4-5**], and is some combination of consolidation, atelectasis, and effusion.
Lung volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size.
There is no pneumothorax.
Dense calcification of the thoracic aorta is seen.
Extensive bilateral carotid calcifications are noted.
Extensive bilateral carotid calcifications.
[**2167-4-13**] HIP XRAY Patient with a IM rod and gamma nail fixating a right subtrochanteric femoral fracture with an unchanged 3mm step off of the lateral corticated margin with stable minimal overiding.
Degenerative changes are noted in the bilateral femoroacetabular joints with joint space narrowing and sclerotic change.
Degenerative changes are also noted in the lower lumbar spine with disc space narrowing and endplate sclerosis.
Patient appears to have a very large left-sided hernia, possibly scrotal with significant amount of radiopaque density in bowels, likley due to prior barium studies.
IMPRESSION: Right subtrochanteric femoral fracture fixated by IM rod and gamma nail with unchanged 13 mm lateral step off.
No evidence of hardware complication or interval healing.
Large left-sided hernia, possibly scrotal, please correlate clinically.
DISCHARGE LABS: - Na 125 - Cl 93 - HCO3 25 - K 4.0 - BUN 8 - Cr 0.5 - Glu 93 - Ca 7.7 - Mg 1.7 - Phos 3.5 - WBC 3.9 - Hct 30.9 - Plt 199  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 79974**] was hospitalized with a right hip fracture following a fall and underwent an uncomplicated right open reduction of his internal fracture with a cephalomedullary nail.
In the immediate postoperative period, he was hypoxic with altered mental status due to difficulty protecting his airway.
Right hip fracture: s/p ORIF on [**2167-4-3**] as above, had adequate pain control with infrequent Tylenol as needed.
Incision was noted to have continuous serous oozing without evidence of infection.
Patient is to continue prophylactic lovenox for 4 weeks from [**2167-4-3**]; it was held for one day due to significant ecchymosis and vitamin K was given to reverse INR.
Ecchymosis remained stable, showed evidence of slow resolution, and lovenox was restarted.
Pt has had mental decline last 6 mos and family does report a long history of phlegm production and difficulty clearing his secretions w/o frank episodes of aspiration or hospitalizations for PNA.
Speech and swallow eval, video swallow noted aspiration and penetration with thin liquids and residue after all consistencies of barium and slow swallowing mechanism.
He is to take small bites with multiple swallows.
Please obtain nutrition consultation within one week of discharge to assess for nutrition needs.
PNA: Completed 7 day course of levaquin for PNA on CXR, clinically remained afebrile with unchanged baseline cough and no oxygen requirement.
Hernia: Inguinal hernia into scrotum that per pt and family is 25 years old without hernia repair given asymptomatic.
[**4-8**] ultrasound showed herniated loops of bowel with an area that may either represent hypoactive bowel with intraluminal air or potentially perf with free air.
Pt is without clinical signs of obstruction or perforation or infection, but would have low threshold to evaluate with CT scan if he complains of any abdominal or hernia/scrotum pain, if hernia appears tense, or if with any fever/white count, nausea/vomiting, or other signs of obstruction/perforation/incarceration.
He subsequently redeveloped hyponatremia; cortisol was normal and a renal consultation found this consistent with SIADH, likely due to pain as he did not have any concerning medications or history to suggest another etiology.
He is not on home coumadin or aspirin given history of low platelets, per family.
His pills were crushed in applesauce but it was unclear how much of his dosage he was able to receive due to dysphagia.
His blood pressure and heart rate remained well-controlled without additional medications.
He reported some occasional lightheadedness attributed to a combination of dehydration and atrial fibrillation which led to his unsteadiness and the inciting fall.
Eventually his fingersticks and sliding scale insulin were stopped as he did not require insulin for over a week.
Edema: With fluid restriction and sodium supplementation he developed diffuse edema.
The edema improved markedly with Lasix and he is to continue Lasix until sodium supplmentation is stopped.
Incidental finding of carotid calcification on chest x-ray: Will require outpatient follow-up with primary care provider.

Outpatient Speech/Swallowing Therapy Please follow up aspiration and dysphagia noted on previous barium swallow video.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr [**Known lastname 79974**],  You were hospitalized with a hip fracture and underwent surgery to repair this fracture.
We feel that your fall was due to lightheadedness from your atrial fibrillation.
Please have your primary physician evaluate your [**Name9 (PRE) 19390**] atrial fibrillation and work up potential osteoporosis leading to your hip fracture.
You were found to have low sodium indicating dehydration, and you were given intravenous rehydration as well as improved nutrition.
You were found to have an aspiration risk from poor swallowing and your food was modified to help you eat safely.
You were treated for a pneumonia that we think was a result of food aspiration.
We did not feel there was clinical evidence of perforation or obstruction as your bowel movements were normal, non-bloody, and you were without pain.
Please have your physician closely monitor this hernia for danger signs of pain, obstruction, incarceration, or perforation of bowel.
You had a foley catheter to help with urinary drainage given your decrease mobility after the operation.
- STOPPED glipizide.
You should review your medications and discuss follow up care for your low sodium, atrial fibrillation, and hip surgery as well as the finding of carotid artery calcification.
