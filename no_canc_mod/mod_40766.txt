His family states that over the past 2-3 weeks he had been waking up every morning with a horrible frontal headache over the right frontal portion of his head.
Head Ct was reviewed with showed a large right frontotemporal parietal mass with vasogenic edema and midline shift of 1cm.
Review of systems - unable to obtain intubated   Past Medical History: HTN DM hypercholesterolemia  Social History: lives in [**Hospital1 487**], MA.
non-smoker, minimal EtOH, no illicits  Family History: Family Hx: Mother - cancer - unknown type Father - MI kids - healthy  Physical Exam: Vitals: 97.8 72 167/87 18 SpO2 100% 60%FIO2(on vent) General: intubated, sedated, tooth displaced HEENT: b/l pterygium in eyes, atraumatic, non-icteric sclera Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: CTAB, no w/c/r Cardiac: RRR, no murmurs Abdomen: distended abdomen, no ascites, no Cullen or grey [**Doctor Last Name 4862**] sign Extremities: no edema, pulses palpated, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Neurologic: GCS E2V1M5 8T Mental Status: sedated, non-responsive to sternal rub Cranial Nerves: pupils 2mm b/l and reactive, bilateral pterygium  + corneals, facial symmetric, + gag, + cough Motor: normal tone and bulk, Purposeful in all extremities R>L, some spontaneous movement bilaterally Reflexes: 2+ UE and LE Babinski is flexor response b/l   Pertinent Results: [**2129-7-14**] MRA OF THE HEAD: The head MRA demonstrates no evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis.
No evidence of an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size seen.
IMPRESSION: No vascular occlusion or stenosis is seen on the MRA of the head.
MRI Brain IMPRESSION: Rim-enhancing lesions in the right periventricular region adjacent to the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle and right parietal subcortical region as well as subtle signal abnormality and enhancement in the right thalamus.
Differential diagnosis includes metastasis versus lymphoma.
The signal abnormalities on diffusion images in the right thalamus and periatrial region could be related to lymphoma or could be due to small infarcts unrelated to the primary abnormality.
Mass effect is seen on the right lateral ventricle with mild midline shift.
[**2129-7-14**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Extensive vasogenic edema throughout the right hemisphere is again seen, without change since prior study.
No evidence of primary malignancy in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 91616**] was admitted to the ICU, intubated at OSH, with frequent neuro checks, blood pressure control less than 140, Mannitol Q4 hours for significant edema and midline shift with frequent Serum OSM and Na checks.
In addition he was started on Dexamethasone for cerebral edema and dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
on [**7-14**] he underwent an MRI/A that demonstrated ring enhancing lesions in the right parietal lobe and abutting the right lateral ventricle.
CT torso demonstrated no evidence of malignancy.
On [**7-17**] he developed speech difficulty and tongue swelling.
He was given benadryl and IV decadron with no relief.
He was on paralytics but he had no pupillary response and then his exam remained poor when off sedation.
On [**7-18**], he was take to the OR for a decompressive craniectomy.
Post-op imaging showed significant cerrebral edema.
