He complained of  feeling "poorly" all day on the day prior to admission, with back pain, nausea, and profound weakness (though he did go towork).
He took tylenol with codeine for back pain and Tums for symptoms of indigestion.
Given narcan due to pinpoint pupils with no response.
Initial EKG with Afib at 98, Lateral ST depressions, inferior Q waves; then converted to sinus rhythm 117, lateral ST depression, inferior Q waves.
Past Medical History: Hypertension hyperlipidemia remote h/o tobacco use .
Cardiac Risk Factors: - Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension    Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use; he is a former smoker (stopped in [**2161**], has 15 pk yr hx).
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Mother died of MI at 63, also had DM, depression.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: Obese, soft, ND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
R fem arterial sheath in place Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The right coronary artery demonstrated a totally occluded proximal RCA with a large thrombus burden.
The left system was not engaged - outside hospital angiography demonstrated no severe stenosis with the distal left supplying collaterals to the right.
Successful thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of the proximal - mid RCA with a Vision (3x28mm) bare metal stent postdilated with a 4.0 mm balloon in the proximal portion of the stent.
Final angiography  demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of the proximal-mid RCA with a bare metal stent.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis and basal inferolateral hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
M with a PMH of HTN and hyperlipidemia transferred from OSH after VFib arrest and diagnostic cath demonstrated TO of RCA.
# CAD/Ischemia: Pt presented with late sx of ischemia after suffering Vfib arrest at home.
Diagnostic cath at OSH demonstrated no stenosis of LAD, 50% ostial D1, mild stenosis of mid LCx and prox occlusion of RCA.
ECHO showed EF of 45% with akinesis of inferior wall and no RV involvement.
History of Vfib arrest, most likely secondary to ischemic event.
He was monitored on telemetry while hospitalized and did not have any further arrhythmias.
# Altered Mental Status - Pt was bagged in the field by EMS and intubated on arrival at OSH.
Per report CT head negative for evidence of CVA.
Per behavioral neurology consult, this is likely anoxic brain injury, and will improve with time, no need for MRI at this time.
Psychiatry was consulted to see patient for agitation, confusion, and paranoia, and suggested using Haldol and redirection rather than antipsychotics or sedatives.
His mental status has since greatly improved, and his short term memory continues to improve as well.
# PNA - Patient has been febrile since admission.
Etiology unclear but etiologies include aspiration during myocardial infarction, or introduction of organisms during intubation.
# GI bleed - On admission, pt with coffee ground emesis on NG tube suctioning - heme positive.
No evidence of active bleeding with NG lavage.
# Elevated LFTs - At OSH AST 271, ALT 197.
Haloperidol 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for agitation.
Myocardial infarction with Vfib arrest 2.
MSSA pneumonia 3.
Anoxic brain injury .
Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension hyperlipidemia remote h/o tobacco use   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, stable vital signs, tolerating POs, ambulating without assistance, mental status improving.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital as you had a heart attack and an abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation.
Given the amount of time that elapsed from the beginning of your symptoms you may have suffered some anoxic brain injury.
You were agitated initially, and you were seen by Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurology, who recommended a medication at bedtime called Haldol, which you should continue to take at night as needed.
