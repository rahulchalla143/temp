FINDINGS: Slightly improved mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
There is no pleural pathology.
IMPRESSION: Slightly improved mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 59 year old man with a history of CHF (EF 15%).
Following the procedure he was observed in the CCU out of concern for embolization causing mesenteric ischemia.
# CAD: Patient has a history of CAD s/p stenting.
It showed the one vessel CAD and elevated Left sided filling pressures.
# CHF - Patient had an EF of 15% on recent echo with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
We held his ACE inhibitor in the setting of his acute renal failure and report of previous hyperkalemia on an ACE inhibitor (with worsening renal function).
# HTN - The patient had a hypotensive episode at the OSH after receiving BP meds.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient presented with low urine output and increasing creatinine.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Systolic Heart Failure  Secondary Diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease Renal failure   Discharge Condition: Patient was breathing on room air.
