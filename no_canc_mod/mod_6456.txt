He reported experiencing sharp retrosternal chest pain with radiation to b/l arms, back, and neck.
Pain was associated with shortness of breath/lightheadedness/dizziness/diaphoresis, no N/V.
An EKG was obtained at the office and revealed non-specific ST elevation in the inferior leads.
Pt referred for cath which revealed LAD and RCA dz, he was then referred to CT surgery.
Pt brought to OR on [**10-28**] for coronary artery bypass grafting   Past Medical History: HIV--most recent CD4 count 361, viral load undetectable ([**5-/2184**]) H. pylori associated gastric MALToma Secondary syphillis h/o MRSA abscess  Social History: Works as wedding planner at local hotel.
There is atelectasis at the lung bases bilaterally, which is unchanged.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions also unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Small bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, unchanged.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior - hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; apex - hypo; remaining LV segments contract normally.

Results were personally  Conclusions: PRE-CPB No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the septal, anteroseptal, and anterior walls.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
Overall LV systolic function improved - EF now 45-50% but septal, anterosepatal, and anterior mild hypokinesis remain.
Brief Hospital Course: 44 yoM with HIV, presents with 5 days of chest pain.
After ER evaluation paient referred for cath which revealed LAD and RCA dz, he was then referred to CT surgery.
Pt brought to OR on [**10-28**] for coronary artery bypass grafting, please see OR report for details in summary pt had CABGx2 with LIMA-LAD and SVG-PDA.
