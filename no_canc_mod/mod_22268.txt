Admission Date:  [**2148-12-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2148-12-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2090-5-27**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old male, with a history of aortic stenosis, bicuspid atrial valve, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, with a recent admission to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**11-20**], following a one week episode of shortness of breath, increase in lower extremity edema, PND.
A cardiac echo done at the outside hospital revealed mildly dilated left ventricle with normal wall thickness, severe diffuse hypokinesis, ejection fraction 30%.
There was 1+ mitral valve regurgitation and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation with an estimated pulmonary arterial pressure of 51 mmHg.
On certain views there appeared to be a 2 cm gelatinous mass attached to the lateral wall of the right atrium just below the tricuspid valve.
Vitamin E, Vitamin C.  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Cardiac - regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur, and a II/VI holosystolic murmur noted at the apex through the axilla.
Abdominal exam - soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly noted.
The results of this are as follows:  Moderately elevated filling pressures, mean transaortic gradient approximately 60 mmHg.
Right dominant coronary angiography:  LAD 80% stenosis at the proximal level, 30% stenosis at the mid level.
Left circumflex:  80% stenosis at the proximal small intermedius, 90% proximal large OM1, occluded mid left circumflex.
It was determined that the patient needed to undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram to evaluate the questionable mass seen on the echo from the outside hospital.
On [**12-17**], the patient underwent the TEE, and this demonstrated no discernible mass on the right atrium.
On[**2148-12-18**], the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting x 3, and replacement of his ascending aorta.
The aortic valve was replaced with a 23 mm CE pericardial valve.
There were no complications during the case, and the patient tolerated the procedure without difficulty.
The patient was gently weaned and extubated that same night, and placed on 50% face mask which maintained his O2 sats at 97-98%.
The patient was started on a clear liquid diet which he tolerated without difficulty.
The patient's chest tube drained a moderate amount of sanguineous and serosanguineous fluid, no air leak or crepitus were noted.
The patient tolerated this procedure well, and there were no complications.
The patient also had his Foley removed.
The patient was evaluated by physical therapy, and the patient was able to ambulate 450', steady gait, with no gross balance defects.
On postoperative day #3, the patient's course was complicated by an episode of atrial fibrillation.
The patient quickly reverted out of atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm at the starting of the intravenous amiodarone.
Also on this day, the patient had his pacing wires removed.
The patient tolerated this procedure well with no change in blood pressure.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was in good condition, afebrile, ambulating intermittently, pain well-controlled on oral medication, in normal sinus rhythm.
Congestive heart failure.
Aortic stenosis.
Status post left arm fracture with surgical repair.
