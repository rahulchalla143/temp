History of Present Illness: The pt is a 76 year-old woman with CAD and Parkinson's Disease, who was admitted with abdominal pain, found to have an incarcerated right inguinal hernia with small bowel obstruction.
She was reportedly brought in to [**Hospital3 **] due to decreased urine output, and was found to be lethargic and jaundiced, with a mottled abdomen.
She had an abdominal CT which showed an SBO and incarcerated inguinal hernia, as well as left lower lobe infiltrates.
LUNGS: CTA(B) COR: RRR ABD: (R)inguinal incision with steri-strips c/d/i.
Mild mask facies.
Minimal cogwheeling.
The stomach is slightly distended.
Left lower lobe consolidation is unchanged.
Improved linear atelectasis in the left mid hemithorax.
Increase in right perihilar and right inferior opacities.
IMPRESSION: Consolidation in the left lower lobe favor pneumonia over atelectasis, correlate clinically.
[**2137-9-22**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
Left atrial abnormality.
Occasional premature atrial contractions.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2137-9-24**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
[**2137-9-24**] AP CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the monitoring and support devices have been removed, except for a right central venous access line.
There appears to be a small left reactive effusion.
Otherwise no relevant radiographic changes.
Right internal jugular line has been repositioned to the mid-to-low SVC.
Left lower lobe atelectasis is improved, small left and possible small right pleural effusion are still present.
No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.
Hernia sac, right femoral (A): Hernia sac with acute inflammation, fibrin, and focal fat necrosis consistent with focal ischemic changes.
Small bowel, resection (B-D): Small intestinal mucosa with ischemic changes consistent with obstruction, see note.
The glistening tissue appears slightly hemorrhagic.
The fat is serially sliced to reveal adipose tissue with areas of possible hemorrhage.
There is a small portion of attached mesentery that measures 9.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm.
One end appears to have a section of grossly normal small bowel that measures 2.5 cm in length x approximately 2.1 cm in diameter.
The specimen is opened to reveal yellow brown fecal material and a diffusely erythematous mucosa with an area of possible necrosis measuring 6.7 x 5.4 cm.
In addition, there is a white plaque-like lesion on the mucosa (?ulceration) measuring 0.8 x 0.6 cm.
The specimen is represented as follows: B = representative sections of margin, C = representative sections of grossly necrotic/erythematous mucosa, D = ulcer.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2137-9-21**] for evaluation and treatment of a small bowel obstruction and right inguinal hernia.
She was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] intubated, hypotensive in acute renal failure.
The surgery went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient was admitted to the SICU NPO and intubated, with an NG tube to low suction, on IV fluids and empiric IV Zosyn, and a fentanyl drip for pain control.
Neuro: The patient was transition from a fentanyl drip to Morphine IV PRN the day after surgery with good effect and adequate pain control.
Renal functions were improved, but still elevated with a creatinine of 2.5.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged and adhered to throughout hospitalization.
Given the Parkinson's Disease and family report of choking on liquids pre-hospitalization, Speech Language Pathology was consulted prior to starting a diet.
Initially, nectar thickened liquids and ground solids was recommended, but upgraded to soft solid diet with thin liquids by POD#6.
Upon admission, the patient experienced acute renal failure with a BUN/Creatinine initally 115/5.2.
Post-operative hypernatremia and hypokalemia were corrected by gentle free water and electrolyte repletement as discussed above.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
At the time of discharge on [**2137-9-27**], the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular soft solid diet, ambulating with a walker and assistance, urine output via the urostomy was good, and pain was well controlled mostly with acetaminophen.
