Admission Date:  [**2155-3-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-3-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-11-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**] Chief Complaint: Pericardial effusion with pulsus paradoxus of 20  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**First Name3 (LF) **]-guided pericardial fluid drainage Thoracentesis (twice) Placement of pleurex catheter ro right pleural space   History of Present Illness: 79yo M with PMHx significant for aortic stenosis s/p AVR (tissue) [**2155-2-17**], COPD, prostate CA (s/p radiation and hormonal therapy [**2150**])who presented from clinic with pericardial effusion found to have pulsus of 20mmHg.
Patient was recently re-admitted for further evaluation of hypotension from his rehab facility.
An ECHO done during that admission ([**3-3**]) showed a moderate amount of pericardial fluid, mostly overlying the left ventricle and comparatively little fluid over the right ventricular free wall.
There was abnormal septal motion which could be due to a conduction abnormality, post-operative state or increased inter ventricular dependence, and an accentuated respiratory variation in mitral inflows but no other evidence of tamponade physiology.
He says he has had minimal swelling in the lower extremities.
He notes some intermittent nausea and poor PO intake over the last week or so.
Has no other complaints.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Peribronchial wall thickening, predominantly in the right lower lobe with endoluminal narrowing, may be due to acute bronchitis.
A right hilar lymph node conglomerate at the level of the bifurcation of the bronchus intermedius measures 7 x 22 mm (5:55), which may be reactive due to the right complex effusion but followup is recommended.
There is no left hilar, mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy.

[**Location (un) 5099**] VIRUS B ANTIBODIES: Negative    Brief Hospital Course: 79yo M with PMHx significant for aortic stenosis s/p AVR (tissue) [**2155-2-17**], COPD, prostate CA (s/p radiation and hormonal therapy [**2150**]) who presented from clinic with pericardial effusion now s/p pericardiocentesis; also w/ pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis.
# Loculated pericardial effusion: Patient presented with a pericardial effusion with pulsus paradoxus of 20; [**Year (4 digits) **] on admission did not show signs of cardiac tamponade.
The patient's cultures grew out Staph epidermidis, a separate coag negative Staph and Micrococcus; however, this was thought to be due to contamination, so antiobitics were not started.
EBV serologies were sent and were negative for acute EBV infection.
ID was consulted given concern for the low grade fevers and the positive pericardial fluid cultures, they also felt that the positive cultures were contamination and recommended against antibiotics.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
The patient had serial [**Location (un) **]'s through the admission that showed trivial pericardial effusions with no evidence of tamponade.
On days of discharge, [**Location (un) **] showed no evdence of pericardial effusion.
The etiology of the pericardial effusion is thought to be reactive from his recent aortic valve replacement surgery less than a month prior to this admission.
# Pleural effusion: Patient with a right-sided loculated bloody/exudative pleural effusion with eosinophilia, thought to be secondary to instrumentation from aortic valve replacement.
The pleural fluid collected from thoracentesis was negative for malignant cells, and the cultures were also negative.
A Chest CT was done to further evaluate pleura to determine if there was pleural pathology that could explain the eosinophilia present in the pleural fluid.
Interventional pulmonology placed a pleurex catheter to drain the remaining right-sided pleural effusion, which was removed after approximately 36 hours; the catheter drained a total of 860cc of serosangenous fluid.
The patient's sternal incision was clean, dry, and intact through the admission.

9. alprazolam 0.25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)) as needed for anxiety.

Disp:*66 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9485**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Pericardial effusion Right sided pleural effusion  Secondary diagnosis: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Status post Aortic valve replacement   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You underwent drainage of this collection, there was no fluid around your heart on your most recent heart ultrasound prior to discharge.
The fluid culture grew multiple bacteria, which we think was not a true infection after speaking with our infectious disease team.
It is important that you call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have any fevers greater than 100.0F or chills at home.
The causes of your fluid collection were thought to be due to the recent heart surgery that you had.
