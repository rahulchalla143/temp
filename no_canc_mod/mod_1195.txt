HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86 year-old man who was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 69**] in early [**2193-6-1**] and was found to have MSSA bacteremia.
The patient then returned to [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2193-6-26**] feeling itchy with a rash over his extremities.
He also complained of a low grade fever, but denied any other symptoms on admission.
myocardial infarction in [**2168**], coronary artery bypass graft in [**2192-5-1**].
Congestive heart failure with an EF of 30%.
History of nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia status post AICD implantation.
Left ventricular aneurysm.
History of primary hyperparathyroidism status post resection.
Anemia of unknown etiology presumed secondary to CRI.
History of urinary tract infection.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He had no lymphadenopathy or JVD.
There was a [**2-6**] holosystolic murmur at the upper sternal border bilaterally and there are no rubs or gallops.
He had scattered rhonchi bilaterally and pulmonary auscultation.
His abdomen was mildly distended.
There was normoactive bowel sounds and there was mild left lower quadrant tenderness.
His extremities were warm and there was no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
He had petechial lesions on his lower extremities greater in his upper extremities bilaterally.
Given his mildly elevated liver enzymes an abdominal ultrasound was performed in the Emergency Department.
This study demonstrated no intrahepatic ductal dilatation, no hydronephrosis, a cholestic structure of the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe, gallstones, a small amount of ascites and a small right sided pleural effusion.
Chest x-ray demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions and slight worsening congestive heart failure.
IMPRESSION:  Given the patient's presentation with the petechial rash, low grade fevers, peripheral eosinophils, elevated serum creatinine and onset of symptoms ten to twelve days after Oxacillin was started the presumptive diagnosis was Oxacillin induced acute interstitial nephritis.
Given the recent increase in the patient's Furosemide dose from 20 to 40 the possibility of prerenal azotemia was considered and urine electrolytes were sent.
Given his acute renal failure the patient's Furosemide and Lisinopril were held, Oxacillin was discontinued and Levaquin was started.
Although the rash was most likely secondary to Oxacillin induced AIN, given the associated acute renal failure and low grade fever the possibility of vasculitis was considered and serum ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] were sent.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the evening of hospital day number two the patient developed chest pain in conjunction with JVD and bilateral crackles.
Sublingual nitroglycerin relieved the pain slightly.
Chest x-ray showed increased bibasilar haziness.
No acute changes were noticed on electrocardiogram.
He was assumed to be in acute congestive heart failure and diuresed with good symptomatic relief.
Hemolysis panel came back negative.
Urine electrolytes showed a sodium of 53, therefore the possibility of prerenal azotemia was felt to be less likely.
The night of hospital day number three the patient became tachypneic with respiratory at 38, oxygen saturation 86% on room air.
A chest x- ray again showed bilateral pulmonary edema with effusions, which increased a magnitude from a chest x-ray done earlier that afternoon.
There were no changes on electrocardiogram.
The patient had no urine output to a total of 70 mg intravenous Lasix, and he was subsequently intubated for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
He was then transferred to the MICU where he became hypotensive and transiently required pressors to maintain his blood pressure.
Serum chemistries done on the morning after transfer to the MICU demonstrated an increase in anion gap metabolic acidosis.
He also showed worsening uremia with a BUN of 71 and a creatinine of 3.6.
Given his hypotension the resulting concern for sepsis the patient's antibiotic coverage was broadened with the addition of Vancomycin to Levofloxacin.
He was continued on steroids and bicarb and he was started on Furosemide drip with Dyazide diuretics for clinically apparent congestive heart failure exacerbation.
A trial of weaning the patient off ventilators was not attempted secondary to his metabolic acidosis.
Blood cultures were drawn, which came back positive for yeast.
Urine sputum and fungal isolates were drawn on [**2193-6-29**], which came back negative at the time, but the patient had increasing thick oral secretions and therefore an ID consult was obtained.
On hospital day number ten sputum culture with gram stain showed gram positive cocci, which was speciated to staph aureus and the patient was continued on Vancomycin.
He was therefore started on a steroid taper and was hydrated with fluids to maintain blood pressure and renal perfusion.
On hospital day number fourteen the patient's serum creatinine had decreased to 2.3, although his BUN increased to 157 most likely secondary to his steroid taper.
He also experienced an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation on hospital day number fourteen and was started on Metoprolol.
On the day he was called out of the MICU the patient complained of chest pain, which resolved spontaneously.
Electrocardiogram done at the time demonstrated no changes.
Urine sediment demonstrated muddy brown casts and nondimorphic red blood cells consistent with ATN.
Given this significant prerenal azotemia, which was attributed to a poor po intake versus congestive heart failure versus renal hyperperfusion versus catabolism versus glucocorticoid therapy, the patient was initiated on IVF with a goal of achieving adequate hydration to decrease his BUN and to clear his sensorium so he would again take adequate po fluids.
A 24 hour urine collection done demonstrated alarmingly low creatinine clearance of 14 and therefore his collection was repeated for confirmation.
On subsequent examinations the patient refused to answer questions through an interpretor and given the presumptive diagnosis of depression the patient was started on Paxil empirically.
The results of repeat 24 hour urine collection obtained on hospital day 26 again demonstrated a very low creatinine clearance of 12 and given this value as well as hisuremia and chronically poor po intake plans were therefore made to initiate hemodialysis.
The patient received three straight days of hemodialysis and by hospital day number 33 after four rounds of hemodialysis the patient's BUN had fallen to 41 and his mental status appeared to improve.
The Psychiatry Service did not feel that the patient was depressed, but rather had a component of delirium versus dementia.
Given his chronically poor po intake and his multiple episodes of pulling out feeding tubes the patient received a PEG tube, which was placed on hospital day number 31.
Tube feeds were initiated after the procedure, which the patient tolerated without difficulty.
On hospital day number 34 the patient developed an elevated temperature of 99.6 axillary, which was an increase of 3 to 4 degrees above the patient's baseline.
Given this elevation, blood cultures, urine cultures and chest x-ray were obtained.
By the time of this dictation the patient received a steroid taper for acute interstitial nephritis and he had completed six weeks of antibiotic treatment for MMSA bacteremia and MRSA sputum culture.
