Admission Date:  [**2185-9-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2185-9-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2107-11-7**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 78-year-old white male with a history of known coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2178**], status post PTCA of the left anterior descending artery in [**2178**], who subsequently developed VT with episodes of syncope and had AICD placed in [**2178**], also with history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes type 2 insulin requiring, who underwent EP ablation of VT focus today, [**2185-9-5**].
The patient reports having had no chest pain, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, PND, and was doing well until several months prior to admission.
He was told by his cardiologist that his ICD device was having to overdrive pace his ventricle for episodes for ventricular tachycardia.
The patient was unaware of the ventricular tachycardia and was asymptomatic during episodes.
He was advised by his cardiologist to have an electrophysiological study with mapping and ablation of his ventricular tachycardia focus.
Subsequently, status post ablation, the patient developed a profuse bleeding and large hematoma formation at his right groin catheterization site.
At this time, the patient reported only mild nausea, mild groin and leg pain.
In the interim, the patient was sent for an ultrasound which demonstrated no evidence of pseudoaneurysm formation at the site of the femoral hematoma.
He was volume resuscitated with 3 liters of IV fluid.
The bleeding stopped and pressure dressing was applied.
He denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, back pain, fevers, chills.
He did have one episode of emesis upon arrival to the unit, but denied any recurrent nausea.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2178**].
Stress echocardiogram in [**2181**] showed no evidence of ischemia.
Ventricular tachycardia status post ICD placement in [**2178**].
Prior to ICD placement, patient had symptoms of syncope.
Diabetes type 2, insulin requiring.
Status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2178**].
FAMILY HISTORY:  Patient has father with history of diabetes, deceased from myocardial infarction at age 78.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, stool changes, orthopnea, PND, headache, lightheadedness, syncope.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:  Vital signs showed a temperature of 98.8, blood pressure 126/52, heart rate 80, respiratory rate 21, oxygen saturation 99% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Neck is supple, no masses or lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits auscultated.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Groin:  Left femoral catheterization site with Tegaderm dressing clean, dry, and intact, no blood oozing, no bruit auscultated.
Extremities:  Warm and dry, with right foot slightly cooler than left.
Bilateral leg edema 1+.
ULTRASOUND:  No pseudoaneurysm formation.
His Lipitor dose was increased to 40 mg po q day and was to be modified after a check of his lipid profile.
Originally, the patient's ACE inhibitor was held secondary to his falling hematocrit, the question of any blood pressure lability.
Patient was not started on a beta blocker secondary to his history of reactive airway disease.
As the patient was status post ablation for ventricular tachycardia, he is monitored on telemetry for arrhythmias.
Overnight he had occasional episodes of ectopy with PVCs in singlets and couplets.
He did not have any runs of ventricular tachycardia.
On hospital day #2, an echocardiogram was done to assess the patient's left ventricular function and assess for any valvular abnormalities.
Echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 40%, mild left atrial dilatation.
Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypo/akinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall.
The aortic valves are mildly thickened.
He had trace aortic regurgitation.
Trivial mitral regurgitation.
He was chest pain free.
He did not have any evidence of ectopy on telemetry monitoring.
Right groin hematoma:  Patient underwent ultrasound which demonstrated no evidence of pseudoaneurysm formation.
Additionally, Vascular Surgery was following the patient and recommended serial hematocrit checks q4h with a goal to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 in light of his coronary artery disease history.
Therefore, the decision was made to hold off on transfusion and simply monitor the patient with serial hematocrits.
In addition, he was volume resuscitated with a total of 3 liters of IV fluid.
Asthma:  Patient was prescribed an albuterol MDI inhaler for use on an as needed basis for shortness of breath or wheezing.
He experienced no evidence of dyspnea, shortness of breath, wheezing, bronchospasm during this admission.
Status post ablation of ventricular tachycardia foci.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Diabetes type 2.
Patient was told to notify his primary care physician or visit [**Name Initial (PRE) **] local Emergency Room if he experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, groin pain at his catheterization site, back pain, nausea, vomiting, fainting, or lightheadedness.
