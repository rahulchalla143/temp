Pleural plaques suggestive of prior asbestos exposure, correlate clinically  Echocardiogram [**2105-10-27**]: Conclusions The patient is on a Neosynephrine drip @ 0.5 mcg/kg/min Left ventricular EF is 45-55% with no regional wall motion abnormalities.There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion  [**2105-10-27**] 2:42 am URINE     Site: CATHETER                              **FINAL REPORT [**2105-10-29**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2105-10-29**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.

Aterosclerotic disease.
Severe left hydronephrosis.
No definite stone seen.
No hydroureter.
Right renal cyst.
No perinephric fluid collection is identified    Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 91062**] is an 88 year-old female with PMHx of afib (not on coumadin) and dementia & who is transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with urosepsis complicated by a fib with RVR.
# Urosepsis: Initial sepsis was thought to be from a urinary source given her grossly infected UA.
Her CXR also showed a patchy opacity in RUL on CXR and ground glass opacity on LLL.
An ECHO was obtained which showed "EF of 40%, [**Month/Year (2) 1192**] MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] TR, Right ventricle pressure overload with septal flattening" and other findings as above.
LENIs showed no DVTs.
Her urine culture grew out pansensitive E.coli which was covered by ceftriaxone.
Once the pt was stable and tranferred to the floor, she was switched to cefpodoxime and will complete a two week course of antibiotics (last day: [**11-9**])  # A-fib w/RVR: Pt has a documented history of A-fib.
Her atenolol was initially held in the setting of septic shock.
However, her HR was elevated and she was placed on a diltiazem gtt.
Her HR continued to be elevated and she was started on a loading dose of digoxin.
She continued to have rapid HR's into the 140's once she arrived on the floor.
As her infection presumably improved, we were able to stop her digoxin and slowing wean off the diltiazem.
Because of this we elected to perform a renal US to r/o abscess or another source of continued infection.
Renal US showed [**Month/Year (2) 1192**] to severe hydronephrosis on the left side, confirmed by CT abdomen and pelvis.
We conferred with urology and radiology who felt that the hydronephrosis was most likely secondary to an overlying vessel causing compression of the renal pelvis-uteral junction.
# CHF: Pt has a relatively unknown underlying cardiac function.
On the floor the pt did not show any sign/symptoms of fluid overload.
# Chronic pain: Pt reports back and neck pain.
# Dementia: Per report, pt has dementia at baseline, which most likely explains her AMS.
4. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for fever / pain.

You were admitted with a serious infection of urinary tract that spread into your bloodstream.
You also had a rapid heart rate from your atrial fibrillation.
As your infection improved we were able to decrease the amount of medications that you needed to slow your heart rate.
