Admission Date:  [**2159-11-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-11-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-12-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: Acute mental status change in the setting of hyperglycemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar Puncture Hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: A 42 year old lady with a history of ESRD on HD from Type 1 DM presented to the ED with hyperglycemia in the 500s and confusion since earlier that morning.
The patient was found to have a K in the 7-8 range, ?
peaked T waves and a RLL consolidation on CXR.
Patient was given Ceftriaxone 1g, Insulin drip (10 bolus, 7/hour), 1L NS, Calcium gluconate for hyperglycemia and hyperkalemia.
The patient's sister reports that the patient was experiencing lethargy and weakness with worsening severe headaches and photophobia in the past few days, on a background of [**12-29**] months of headache.
Per notes, the patient may have recently restarted Oxycodone/Acetaminophen and Metoclopramide  Past Medical History: - Type 1 diabetes mellitus complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy - End stage renal disease on dialysis, goes M,W,F - s/p LUE AV fistula [**9-2**] which failed to mature, thrombosed and failed thrombectomy.
Now has R IJ permacath, h/o inxn in past catheter [**2158-1-3**] - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Anemia of chronic disease - Right Charcot Foot - s/p Left Toe Amputation - Hypothyroidism   Social History: She lives with her mother and sister in [**Name (NI) 2251**].
Family History: Significant for coronary artery disease in her mother, as well as stroke; a maternal grandmother had heart failure, and her father had coronary artery disease.
HEENT: Dry mucous membranes, pupils slow but reactive once sedated Neck: Patient does react to neck movement, some resistance/rigidity Lungs: Clear anteriorly CV: S1 & S2 regular without murmur Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses with edema, R charcot foot  Pertinent Results: Admission labs ([**2159-11-20**]): WBC-6.5 RBC-4.18* Hgb-11.9* Hct-38.5 MCV-92 MCH-28.5 MCHC-31.0 RDW-16.1* Plt Ct-250 Glucose-679* UreaN-60* Creat-8.9*# Na-121* K-8.5* Cl-82* HCO3-20* AnGap-28* .
No large effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with fluid overload.
[**11-20**] CT head: There is no acute hemorrhage, large areas of edema, large masses or mass effect.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The extensive atherosclerotic calcification involving the distal vertebral and cavernous and supraclinoid internal carotid arteries is quite unusual in a patient of this age and gender, and should be correlated with clinical information.
CXR: [**11-21**]: There is significant interval improvement up to almost complete resolution in widespread pulmonary edema.
No mass effect or hydrocephalus seen.
Hyperintensities in the white matter could be due to small vessel disease.
MRV shows medial portion of the right transverse sinus to be narrowed without corresponding signal abnormality on FLAIR and T2-weighted images.
This could be normal variation in absence of abnormal signal.
If there is continued clinical concern, CT venography of the head could help for further assessment.
MRI with repeat study with diffusion could also help if continued concern for acute infarct.
FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI:  There is no evidence of acute infarct seen.
There is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.
Periventricular hyperintensities are noted indicative of small vessel disease.
These finding are inappropriate for patient's age but are likely related to patient's renal failure.
There is no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, [**Name (STitle) 1106**] or meningeal enhancement seen following the administration of gadolinium.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct or abnormal enhancement.
Small vessel disease.
MRV HEAD:  Head MRV shows slightly narrowed medial portion of the right transverse sinus which is unchanged.
There is normal flow enhancement identified in this region on post-gadolinium images and there is no evidence of thrombosis seen.
This may be secondary to congenital variation or due to a remote thrombosis and recanalization.
No acute thrombosis is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 42 year old female with ESRD from Type 1 diabetes presents with confusion/altered mental status with a recent headache and worsening lethargy in the setting of hyperglycemia.
# Altered Mental Status: The patient was seen by psych and neuro and altered mental was untimately attributed to a toxic metabolic state given her hyperglycemia and uremia.
Patient did not show objective signs of infection (no fever or white count).
LP was not concerning for infection however she was treated with acyclovir until viral cultures were resulted.
She was treated empirically for bacterial meningitis d/t history and marked improvement on antibiotics, however these were discontinued as the pt never showed signs of infection clinically.
Head CT was normal, MRI/MRV showed no acute changes, only chronic microvascular ischmic changes.
Pt had carotid U/S which showed <40% stenosis bilaterally.
Hyperglycemia: The patient was hyperglycemia with alterations in mental status but no evidence of ketones.
Her anion gap was difficult to interpret given her underlying renal disease.
Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive with SBP in 200s, with baseline in 150s.
We administered IV lopressor and hydralazine until her mental status improved and she was able to take her home regimen.
ESRD: The patient was admitted to dialyze off an elevated potassium, but potassium normalized.
She also had an elevated BNP and showed fluid overload on exam therefore underwent routine HD.
CXR findings: Her CXR was concerning for PNA vs. fluid overload.
It was repeated after dialysis and showed resolution of symptoms .

You had an extensive workup which did not reveal a cause for your symptoms but luckily you gradually improved.
Several medications were held to see if they were contributing to your altered mental status: Reglan, Nortriptyline, Percocet, Compazine  Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop confusion, hallucinations, weakness, difficulty speaking or any other concerning symptoms.
