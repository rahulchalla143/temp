Admission Date:  [**2108-12-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-12-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2043-6-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cozaar / Nitroglycerin / Primidone / Zestril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**] Chief Complaint: gangrenous left heel and right heel/great toe ischemia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.Ultrasound-guided imaging for vascular access;contralateral second-order catheter placement with bilateralextremity runoff & abdominal aortogram.
([**2108-12-10**]) 3.Left femoral to posterior tibial artery bypass with in situ saphenous vein graft.
([**2108-12-12**])   History of Present Illness: HPI: 65 M h/o CAD s/p MI in [**2085**], CHF (EF ~20%), DM2, ESRD on HD (?
Patient admitted on [**12-6**] after noted to have gangrenous changes of both heels while at rehab.
Underwent bypass sx w/o complication.
On [**2108-12-13**] pt was finishing ultrafiltration ~1pm (renal note dated early), when he was noted to have a syncopal event for ~10seconds, with telemetry suggestive of VT/VF.
Per pt, he had no further syncopal episodes.
CODE BLUE called ~13:15 for a syncopal event.
Pt was hemodynamically stable upon arrival, alert, oriented, breathing without difficulty.
Of note, the prior evening, patient developed hypotension with sys bp in 60's of unknown etiology and was started on phenylephrine gtt with improvement in BP.
Per surgical service, this was in the setting of slow VT, though it is unclear whether slow VT was the sole cause of hypotension (ddx includes sepsis, bleeding, adrenal insufficiency POD#1).
Patient had been in and out of the hospital since end of [**Month (only) 359**] with recent admissions at OSH for CHF exacerbation, UTI and syncopal episode [**10-18**] [**1-12**] afib with RVR.
No history of syncope prior to [**10-18**].
On review of symptoms, positive hx of L LE DVT (~[**2104**]).
Denies any prior history of stroke, TIA pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Currently w pain in b/l legs with movement.
Passing flatus, no abdominal pain.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.
Chronic nonproductive cough for 3 years.
Past Medical History: PMH: ESRD/HD, HTN, CHF (preop EF 20%, 2+ MR),s/p AICD placement, CAD s/p MI [**2085**], hypercholestereolemia, gout,IDDM, diabetic neuropathy   Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Able to complete ADLS without difficulty.
Retired, in charge of construction and engineering in [**Location (un) 511**] division of [**Company **].
Family History:  There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
65 M with MMP including CAD s/p MI, CHF(EF 20% s/p BiV/AICD), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, Type II DM, ESRD on HD, admitted for gangrenous heels [**1-12**] PVD s/p femoral bypass with course complicated by syncopal episode and V-fibrillation s/p AICD cardioversion.
# Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive requiring pressors.
Following day patient had syncopal episode secondary to Ventricular tachycardia and Code Blue was called.
Given low SVR, normal PA diastolic, borderline leukocytosis and two possible infectious sources including BL gangrene and a mass on the RA lead of his AICD, hypotension was felt to be due to sepsis.
Although he initially had a low cardiac index, this was thought to be consistent with CHF with EF of 20%, and unlikley to be due to cardiogenic shock.
He did not respond to a 1L fluid bolus so a levophed drip was started to provide pressor support with some inotropy.
However patient minimally improved.
No evidence of ischemic changes on ECG.
mild trop leak likely [**1-12**] renal failure, as CK and MB flat.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out ischemic source of troponic leak.
# Rhythm: Hx of atrial fibrillation on coumadin since [**2105**].
Recent admission to OSH for syncopal episodes thought to be [**1-12**] atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Being followed by EP during this admission for episodes of asymptomatic slow V-tach and afib, plan had been to cardiovert AFIB, and then ablate slow monomorphic VT, however patient later developed polymorphic VT.
The patient had multiple episodes of wide complex tachycardiat.
Trend has been that he converts from a paced rhythm, to atrial fibrillation, and then degenerates into either polymorphic or monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.
EP was consulted, recommending to d/c amiodarone given polymorphic VT in the setting of a prolonged QT interval 450-500, start lidocaine gtt and aggressive repletion of electrolytes.
However later due to altered mental status was unable to take oral medications.
Patient became increasingly unstable with persistent ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation unresponsive to defibrillation by his AICD or externally.
No evidence of frank pulmonary edema, hypotensive requiring pressors with CI 1.8->2.1, likely secondary to class III heart failure with EF of 20%.
# Valves: no evidence of valvular disease on ECHO.
# Thrombus on ICD wire: Reviewed echocardiogram with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], and the mass is consistent in nature to infection v. inflammatory.
However patient was increasingly unstable and unable to tolerate TEE.
# PVD: s/p bilateral bypass surgery.
# ESRD: etiology of [**Name (NI) 2091**] unclear(started HD [**10-18**]), s/p ultrafiltration [**2108-12-13**], ?stopped prematurely secondary to syncope and hypotension.
# hyperlipidemia: - continue statin .
