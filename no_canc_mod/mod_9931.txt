HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 31-year-old female with no past medical history who presented after being found unresponsive at work.
While at work she experienced some chest discomfort which she described as in the middle of her chest radiating to her shoulders and present with activity as well as at rest.
She had experienced this discomfort in the past, and in the past it had been responsive to consuming water.
She also notes that this discomfort is worse in the supine position.
Exertion did not seem to change the discomfort significantly, and it was present also while she was inactive.
As it worsened, she noticed shortness of breath and palpitations.
There was some vomitus in the oropharynx.
During the process, she was given another two doses of Narcan without improvement.
An electrocardiogram was done without significant abnormalities noted.
There was no history of substance abuse, or psychiatric illness, or past suicide attempts.
No hospitalizations, and no surgeries.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
She initially denied any alcohol consumption but upon further prodding, she admitted to occasional hard alcohol consumption but denies any excessive quantities and has never had any withdrawal or backout symptoms.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died at the age of 41 of an unclear intracranial event; although, the history sounded most consistent with an intracranial bleed.
Skin examination revealed warm and dry extremities and anicteric skin.
Neck examination was supple with no lymphadenopathy, and the trachea was midline.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdominal examination revealed the abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus with a question of left atrial abnormality, normal intervals, QTc of 400, early repolarization V2 through V3, and P-R depression of 1 mm inferiorly.
A nasogastric tube was in the stomach, and there were no acute cardiopulmonary processes noted.
ALCOHOL ISSUES:  The patient presented with acute intoxication which initially was unclear as to whether this was intentional by the patient or intentional by a co-worker.
She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, vaginal pain, or discomfort, or any other symptoms attributable to sexual assault.
A depression screen revealed that she had occasionally felt sad with regard to losing her father several years prior and has had difficulty sleeping, feelings of guilt at work, and irritability, trouble concentration, and some psychomotor slowing.
She denied any fatigue, decreased energy, decreased appetite, suicidal ideation, or hallucinations.
They did not find any evidence of substance abuse in the patient.
She was arranged to have counseling through the Social Work office to discuss any anxiety or sadness that she may have as a residual from this event as well as from her transition from El [**Country 19118**] to the United States.
A positive depression screen raised concern, and Psychiatry was consulted.
They did not find evidence for a primary psychiatric disorder and felt that the patient may have an underlying anxiety disorder, but they did not feel that medication at this point was prudent and that she would need followup with her primary care physician on discharge.
The patient remained without suicidal ideation throughout her hospitalization and did not show any signs of alcohol withdrawal or other substance withdrawal.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient had experienced a short-lived episode of chest discomfort that seemed to be exacerbated by food, drink, and alcohol which improved with water; unrelated really to exertion.
The patient was a young woman with no clear cardiac risk factors and a normal cholesterol panel.
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction, and serial electrocardiogram showed no evolution of electrocardiogram changes.
It was felt that her chest discomfort may have been related to gastrointestinal related chest pain from reflux disease, possible primary arrhythmia causing palpitations, or less likely ischemia given the paucity of risk factors.
The patient had 48 hours of negative cardiac telemetry; making a cardiac arrhythmia less likely.
The patient was arranged to have an outpatient Holter monitor.
She was maintained on a proton pump inhibitor and had no symptoms while in the hospital.
This supported the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Given the atypical nature of her symptoms and circumstances of her presentation, it would be reasonable for the patient to have an outpatient stress test with imaging to remove ischemic heart disease as a potential etiology for her discomfort.
The patient was discharged with instructions to her physician or to return to the Emergency Department if she experienced any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, loss of consciousness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, or if she felt unsafe at work or at home.
They will aid in arranging outpatient counseling for a possible anxiety disturbance as well as to insure her safety and avoid any episodes of substance abuse.
The patient's new primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was e-mailed regarding the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course and follow-up issues required including the [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor reports.
Acute alcohol intoxication requiring intubation.
Probable gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Probable anxiety disorder.
