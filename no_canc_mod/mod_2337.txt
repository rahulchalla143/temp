Review of [**Hospital Unit Name **] indicates that pt hospitalized in [**2-3**] with new onset ascites and presumed to have HCV cirrhosis (based on immunology/imaging).
Readmitted in early [**4-4**] with recurrent ascites and also increased shortness of breath.
Hospital course notable for challenging interactions between patient and healthcare providers.
During course, ultimately did undergo 2 large volume paracentesis reported to be consistent with chylous ascites.
Also found w/ large right sided pleural effusion for which underwent thoracentesis on [**4-6**] - analysis suggested transudative process and post-procedure, pt transferred to MICU for hypoxia, sedation thought to be med related.
During the later portion of course, noted to have rapidly progressive deterioration in renal dysfunction with creatinine peaking at 5.6 on [**4-14**].
Also noted to have increased hyponatremia to 119 from admission value of 132.
Over the last several days, noted to have increased confusion and lethargy per brother at home.
Noted to have some respiratory distress and EMS called.
Received levofloxacin/metronidazole for possible SBP and ?
Had hypotension on higher doses of propofol in ED/transport and started on levophed.
Past Medical History: 1. presumed HCV cirrhosis c/b massive ascites (VL 155K [**2-3**]) 2. known grade 1 varicies on egd [**2-3**] 3. presumed hepatorenal syndrome 4. thrombocytopenia (low 100's) 5. ivda (heroin) 6. transudative right pleural effusion 7. cholithiasis on abd ct 8. hiatal hernia 9. panic attacks 10. hyponatremia   Social History: lives w/ mother in [**Name2 (NI) **], remote heavy etoh, quit 10 y/a, recent iv heroin (?date)  Family History: Mother is living, 86 years old, with hypertension.
LUNGS - R c decreased BS and dullness to percussion.
L clear CHEST - +gynecomastia, RRR, S1, S2, no rmg ABD - distended, + fluid wave, NT, BS+ EXT - denuded of hair distally.

Pt was managed aggressively in ICU upon admission but his clinical status continued to deteriorate, most  noteably acute renal failure from hepatorenal syndrome despite attempts to correct this.
Acute Renal Failure - Secondary to worsening hepatorenal syndrome and pre-renal azotemia.
[**Name (NI) 14397**] Pt's end stage liver disease and poor prognosis, hemodialysis not ideal.
Given grave overall prognosis, patient was made 'comfort measures only' and no further electrolytes were checked.
Hyperkalemia - secondary to worsening renal failure.
Given grave overall prognosis, patient was made 'comfort measures only' and no further electrolytes were checked.
Hypotension - Multifactoprial including decreased intravascualar volume and sedation.
Also not a candidate  for liver transplant.
Complicated by ascites and associated pleural effusion.
Hyponatremia - Likely [**1-2**] hypervolemic hyponatremia from liver disease.
