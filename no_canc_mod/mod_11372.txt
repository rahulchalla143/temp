The patient is an 80 year old male patient with a past medical history of Crohn's and had just had tumor resected by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**], noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metastases of the chest, status post Gleevec tumor therapy.
He was readmitted, after discharge from [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2186-6-9**], on [**2186-6-11**], when he represented via the Emergency Department for fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea and came in complaining of dehydration, increased lethargy and hypotension.
The patient was seen in the Emergency Department by the surgical service and was assessed to have a distended, tender and tympanitic abdomen.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  X-ray obtained in the Emergency Department illustrated free air with evidence of an acute abdomen and was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] who was covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] as he was out of town.
The patient was found to have a perforated viscus.
He was seen to have a perforation at the distal transverse colon on the proximal sigmoid and he was having a transverse left end sigmoid colectomy, colostomy, Hartmann's pouch with placement of a gastrostomy tube, jejunostomy tube and take-down of the splenic flexure.
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and continued to have a complicated course.
The patient in the beginning of [**Month (only) **] continued to have hemodynamic instability and despite noninvasive imaging immediate source was not obtained.
The patient was given fluid and Levophed and packed red blood cells in hopes to increase blood pressure and hemodynamic stability and was thought origin might be due to intra-abdominal sepsis and was reintubated for airway protection.
CT scan of the chest illustrated bilateral pleural effusions.
Over the next few days, the patient continued to have massive drainage from the chest tube and was eventually stabilized.
In the beginning of [**Month (only) **], the patient continued to have a few intermittent episodes of hypotension and intermittent fevers which were appropriately treated.
An infectious disease consultation was obtained for management of his intermittent fevers and for further investigation of his intra-abdominal sepsis.
The patient continued to have hemodynamic instability despite numerous attempts to wean the patient from ventilatory support secondary to hemodynamic instability, hypovolemia and intra-abdominal sepsis.
Chest tubes continued to drain considerable amount of serosanguineous fluid with the drainage from his gastrostomy tube continuing.
The patient on [**2186-7-9**], went into atrial fibrillation with heart rates in the 110 to 130 range with blood pressure dropping to the 80s.
Initial Lopressor given provided no effect.
The patient was cardioverted and remained in sinus rhythm and improved with two additional fluid boluses.
The patient was tried on continuous positive airway pressure and eventually was weaned after an extended period of time and was extubated on the morning of [**2186-7-11**], and he appeared to be clinically improving for a few days, however, began to have some mental confusion the day after extubation on [**2186-7-12**].
Neurology was consulted for evaluation of a stroke.
The patient was thought to have a multifactorial cause of his confusion but could not rule out an underlying neurological cause such as stroke given his recent events.
He became apneic and asystolic on the monitor.
As the patient was DNR/DNI as per family, his status was confirmed with no vital signs.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Mental status changes.
Intermittent episode of atrial fibrillation.
