Admission Date:  [**2104-4-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-5-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-11-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: external ventricular drain VP shunt Angiogram   History of Present Illness: 54 year old female had a sudden onset of a severe headache and went to an OSH today.
She had a head CT which was read as a posterior fossa bleed measuring 2.8 cm.
The patient was then intubated there for transportation to [**Hospital1 18**].
The patient did not appear to be in any pain in the ER.
There was no family present.
Patient follows complex commands.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Acute midline to just right of midline hemorrhage within the cerebellum with blood products tracking inferiorly through the foramen magnum.
No definite evidence of tonsillar herniation at this time.
Recommend MRI of the head and neck with gadolinium for further evaluation of these processes.
MRI: Right cerebellar hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
Tonsillar herniation at the foramen magnum secondary to mass effect from hemorrhage with deformity of the upper cervical cord.
No evidence of enhancing lesions seen in this region to indicate mass.
However, a followup study would help to exclude a lesion which could be obscured by the hemorrhage.
Mild ventricular dilatation is noted.
No evidence of acute infarct or other areas of abnormal enhancement.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 54 year old female admitted on [**2104-4-11**] with sudden onset headache and found to have a posterior fossa hemorrhage.
Her MRI of the brain showed no mass or AVM, but there was mild ventricular enlargement and tonsillar herniation.
On [**4-13**] the patient had worsening headache and vomiting and was taken to the OR for placement of an EVD.
On [**4-17**] she had an angiogram which showed no aneurysm or AVM.
The patient's nausea and vomiting was decreasing and her ICPs remained within the normal range so her drain was raised to 25 on [**4-20**] and was clamped on [**4-22**].
On [**4-23**] the patient's CT scan showed plump ventricles so the EVD was left in place.
On [**4-26**] the patient complained of some headaches and nausea.
No vomiting was observed but the drain was opened at 15 and the symptoms resolved.
During the procedure the surgery team palpated an abdominal mass so an abdominal CT was ordered.
The postop CT scan of head showed VP shunt in good position in R lateral ventricle and minute bilateral intraventricular bleeding acute on chronic in occipital horns bilaterally.
The CT abdomen showed:  -Large left retroperitoneal mass resulting in mass effect on the left kidney,  shifting it to the right, displacing the spleen superiorly, and extending via the  retroperitoneum into the pelvis where there are multiple areas of focal fat with  surrounding dystrophic calcification as well as more stippled calcification, and  these findings are highly suspicious for retroperitoneal liposarcoma vs. malignant  teratoma with transformation possibly into chondrosarcoma/liposarcoma.
-Bibasilar atelectasis.
-Pelvic ascites which may be related to VP shunt placement.
-Free intraperitoneal gas, likely secondary to recent shunt placement.
On POD#2 from VP shunt pt with orthostatic hypotension w/ low BP and dizziness.
