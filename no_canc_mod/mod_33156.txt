Admission Date:  [**2145-1-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-2-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-1-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 301**] Chief Complaint: (L)LQ abdominal pain and leukocytosis.
[**2145-2-12**]: ERCP for colonic stent placement for a retracting stoma [**2145-2-16**]: ERCP for colonic stent (Wallflex 105mm by 23mm stent; LOT# [**Serial Number 84111**])placement for a retracting stoma   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 4379**] is a 59 year old female who was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with a left-sided diverticulitis/colitis and microperforation containing collection within the pelvis.
She presented to the OSH with LLQ abdominal pain and leukocytosis.
She was also on Zosyn, Levaquin and Flagyl with minimal improvement.
Her hospital course was complicated by ARF secondary to intravascular volume depletion which was treated with volume resuscitation.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further surgical management of her sigmoid diverticulitis.
Past Medical History: PMHx: HTN, Chronic back pain, Morbid obesity, Chronic constipation [**3-2**] narcotics, Immobility secondary to degenerative disk disease resulting in weak (L)LE.
PSHx: Multi-level laminectomy [**2135**] and [**2138**] followed by fusion, Repair of large incarcerated ventral hernia with mesh sublay complicated by wound infection requiring incision and drainage, debridement and VAC placement [**2143-5-17**], Pilonidal cyst excision complicated by persistent drainage [**2143-2-14**], Tubal Ligation.
Physical Exam: On Admission: Vitals: T 98.4 HR 101 BP 119/60 RR 20 Sat 95%RA Gen: lethargic appearing, NAD HEENT: Dry mucous membranes.
NC/AT No scleral icterus Cardiac: RRR; no MRGC Pulmonary: CTA (B) Abdomen: Obese +BS healed midline incision TTP LLQ No rebound, No gaurding Ext: 1+pitting edema .
LUNGS: CTA(B) ABD: Large midline incisional wound granulating and clean.
EXTREM: 1+/4+ pitting edema (B)LE; no c/p/c.
There are low lung volumes.
Aside from minimal atelectasis in the left base, the lungs are clear.
[**2145-1-19**] Renal U/S: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
[**2145-1-25**] Supine Abdominal X-Ray: Limited study with gas-distended small bowel, representing ileus or early obstruction.
Equivocal small free air below right hemidiaphragm may represent perforation of known sigmoid diverticulitis.
New large amount of free intraperitoneal air, consistent with bowel perforation likely due to progression of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis.
Persistent feculent perisigmoid fluid collection, better visualized on outside hospital CTs.
New large gas and fluid containing collection in right mid abdomen.
Small bowel obstruction with probable transition point in mid abdomen.
[**2145-2-6**] KUB/upright: Contrast is seen in the hepatic flexure and transverse colon with gas seen in the descending colon.
There are multiple dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 4.9 cm with multiple air-fluid levels, but no free air is identified.
It is unclear if this represents a small bowel obstruction or an ileus given that colonic gas is still present, but given the patient's history of prior SBO, this is a likely possibility and clinical correlation is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital and admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2145-1-16**] for further treatment of sigmoid diverticulitis with microperforation and acute renal failure.
She was made NPO except medications, started on IV fluids, started on empiric IV Flagyl and Levaquin, and continued on Oxycontin 80mg TID plus OxyIR PRN for pain with good effect.
Neuro: Upon admission, the patient received home Oxycontin 80mg TID plus PRN OxyIR with good effect.
She was transitioned to Methadone and Dilaudid IV PRN once transferred to the floor for post operative pain with adequate pain control.
By [**2-11**], she had been weaned off Methadone, and her pain was well controlled with Dilaudid PO PRN.
Patient started back on home Metoprolol and HCTZ while in SICU for hypertension with good effect.
Pulmonary: Post-operatively while in the SICU, the patient was transitioned from being intubated on mechanical ventilation due to pulmonary edema to nasal CPAP once the pulmonary plethora improved.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GU/FEN: Upon admission, Nephrology was consulted regarding the acute renal failure felt to be secondary to intravascular volume depletion.
Also, she received blood transfusion to address her anemia as well as low oncotic pressure.
She did require a number of doses of Lasix for secondary fluid overload when on the floor, but chronic lower extremity edema was ultimately controlled with home HCTZ.
When not NPO for procedures or tests, the patient tolerated clear liquids advanced to regular when appropriate.
GI: On [**2145-1-25**], the patient underwent descending colostomy, sigmoid resection, and adhesiolysis (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
She will need to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13543**] (Surgery) as an outpatient for stoma revision and stent removal.
[**2145-1-26**] fluid and tissue cultures grew pan-sensitive enterococcus species.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely monitored for signs of infection.
On admission, the patient had a pilonidal cyst wound, which was draining.
Post-operatively, the large midline incisonal wound intitially received saline moist-to-dry dressings, which were changed to a VAC dressing using black foam at 125mmHg on POD#17 with resultant improved wound healing and granulation.
Activity/Mobility: Post-operatively, the patient had a number of issues contributing to impaired mobility, including: morbid obesity, degenerative disc disease s/p back surgeries, degenerative joint disease of knees, post-operative status and associated deconditioning, patient reluctance, and pain.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet with inadequate caloric intake requiring continuation of TPN, ambulating with assistance only short distances, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
