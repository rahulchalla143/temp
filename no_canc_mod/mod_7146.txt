Admission Date:  [**2161-7-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-7-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement, and removal  History of Present Illness: PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**Name11 (NameIs) 507**] [**Name12 (NameIs) 508**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 133**] (APG)  Chief Complaint: SOB Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 89F with history of COPD on home O2 2LNC, pulmonary hypertension, renal insufficiency and carotid insufficiency who presented with acute onset SOB and was admitted to the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory distress.
Patient recently admitted for similar symptoms earlier this month, was discharged from rehab 1 week ago.
The patient reports she was doing well until the day of admission, when she noticed acute onset SOB at 10:30 pm.
Prior to that, she was using her oxygen continuously, taking her inhalers as scheduled, and walking around her house/doing daily tasks without any difficulty breathing.
ROS pertinent for a chronic cough without sputum production.
Ne fevers or chills.
In the ED, patient's vital signs were stable, but was noted to be lethargic with poor air movment on pulmonary exam, both of which improved with nebulizers, solumedrol, and azithromycin/CFTX.
CXR with possible RLL infiltrate.
During the patient's ICU course, she was noted to be SOB with limited air movement.
She was started on Levo/Flagyl for presumed aspiration PNA vs CAP and had a PICC line placed.
She was also started on steroids (prednisone 60 mg PO daily) for presumed COPD exacerbation.
This morning she had an episode of L sided SSC 'pain' that radiated to her right arm associated with some diaphoresis but no LOC, nausea, or vomiting.
Has not experienced this pain before.
EKG with reportedly no changes.
On the floor, patient states that her SOB is greatly improved and denies any further episodes of chest pain.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Pt admits to some difficulty swallowing and sometimes is concerned that food goes down her windpipe, and states she needs new dentures b/c her current ones are ill-fitting.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Moderate/Severe Pulmonary hypertension  (PA pressures 66 + RA last echo) COPD (on home oxygen therapy) Carotid stenosis Chronic renal insufficiency (baseline 1.1-1.6)  Social History: Social History: Lives with granddaughter and family; has VNA at home.
Extremities: mild pitting edema.
Pulm: no rales, no wheezes, no rhonchi (resolved during the admission) Extremities: no pitting edema bilaterally  Pertinent Results: Significant for WBC of 17.3, Hct of 32.0, Cre of 1.3, CK Trop-T of 0.01, 0.02 ABG 7.4/40/76*/26 Lactate 4.0->3.3  Microbiology: Urine Legionella Antigen - negative.
Imaging: EKG - [**7-11**] - sinus tachycardia, + LVH, +LBBB, no new ischemic changes compared to previous.
Mediastinal contours are notable for a tortuous aorta as well as aortic calcification.
There is no pneumothorax.
Left pleural effusion and atelectasis are resolved.
There is a new small right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.
Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, are stable due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-3-8**], no major change.
Pulmonary hypertension without clear cor pulmonale or intracardiac shunt.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 89 yo F with COPD on 2 L home O2, pulmonary hypertension, CKD who presents with acute onset dyspnea likely c/w HCAP requiring ICU admission with continuous nebs and NIPPV, subsequently transferred to the medicine flow.
Shortness of Breath: Patient initially admitted to the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory distress requiring continuous inhalers, NIPPV (BiPAP) and IV steroids.
Likely had a COPD exacerbation, triggered by a PNA (initially ?aspiration vs HCAP, but ultimately most likely HCAP given recent hospitalization and rehab stay).
Initially treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for HCAP, briefly switched to Levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration PNA in the MICU, subsequently switched to Vanc/Cipro for HCAP once on the general floor.
Pt without evidence of ACS on EKG and with several sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
By [**7-14**], she was back to her baseline oxygen requirement of 2L NC with minimal shortness of breath.
They recommended trying a small dose of liquid morphine 30 mins before activity to see if this might decrease shortness of breath (as trial for home).
# Chest Pain: Pt with episode of CP on morning of [**7-12**], resolved with SL nitro.
Pt with multiple risk factors including HTN, CKD, and previous smoking history.
No known history of diabetes with normal HgA1c in [**2158**].
Enzymes were cycled, troponin of 0.05 was felt to be [**1-13**] demand ischemia in the setting of increased work of breathing, no concerning changes on EKG.
A distinct episode epigastric pain on the morning of [**7-15**] was [**1-13**] gas/constipation and was relieved with Milk of Magnesia, Tums, and a BM.
EKG during this episode revealed no changes.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Patient initially with acute on chronic renal failure on admission (Cre 1.5, baseline 1.2).
With known stage III CKD.
# Anemia: Pt with 8 pt Hct drop in the ICU (baseline 40, down to 33), stable on repeat check; likely dilutional due to IVFs and in the setting of phlebotomy.
Stable around 36-37 throughout the rest of her stay with one drop from 41.5 to 36.8, though the single 41.5 value was felt to be due to volume contraction.
The patient was restarted on her home medications, and had only mild elevated BPs in the setting of the prednisone taper (120s-140s today).
