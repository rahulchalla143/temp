Admission Date:  [**2113-5-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2113-5-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2054-5-1**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59-year-old male with chronic renal insufficiency and known coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial infarction in [**2101**], status post CABG in [**2105**] [**Hospital1 **], hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and tobacco use, who presented to [**Hospital3 3834**] with substernal chest pain.
The patient states that around 9:30 pm, he was lying down on the bed and developed [**11-3**] substernal chest pressure.
He felt it might be from overeating, so he forced himself to vomit with no relief.
The pain continued with radiation to the back, arms, bilateral jaw, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, or palpitations, or diaphoresis.
He presented to [**Hospital3 3834**], where he was found to have global ST depression, and was given a half of dose, TNK and Aggrastat and Heparin drip, also borderline hypotension, SBP in the 90s-100 which was sensitive to fluid.
On arrival, he was evaluated by CCU and was found to be stable and pain free, and was decided to transfer to unit and in anticipation for catheterization in the am.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No fever or chills, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, normal bowel movements, no dysuria, no melena, no bright red blood per rectum, no cough, no claudication, no orthopnea, paroxysmal dyspnea, increased edema, increased dyspnea on exertion.
Coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial infarction in [**2101**].
CABG in [**2105**], several peripheral vascular disease.
High cholesterol.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Abdomen has positive bowel sounds, nontender, and nondistended and no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No edema, warm, no clubbing or cyanosis.
Electrocardiogram at [**Hospital1 **]:  Normal sinus rhythm at 91, normal axis and normal intervals, but significant ST depressions in V4 through V6, significantly improved.
Had a bedside echocardiogram which was limited of optimal with no obvious focal wall motion abnormalities through the inferior wall, so the inferior wall may be more hypokinetic, [**2-27**]+ mitral regurgitation, [**1-26**]+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Patient presented to initial CK 114, troponin 0.05 on arrival, to [**Hospital3 **], CK 166, MB 19, troponin greater than 25 but pain free.
Peak CK 571, MB 106, troponin greater than 50, stable and pain free on night of admission.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation revealed severe LMCA and right coronary artery disease.
The LMCA and RCA were both totally occluded proximally without any filling of distal vessels.
Graft angiography demonstrated a patent LIMA to mid left anterior descending artery that supplied a small distal vessel and a small diagonal 2 that ran parralel as a "twin left anterior descending artery" system.
The LIMA also supplied a small proximal vessel and a small bifurcating D1 0 via retrograde flow.
The saphenous vein graft to PDA was widely patent and also filled a small diffusely diseased PLV via retrograde flow.
The saphenous vein graft to OM-1 touchdown on the lower pole of the moderate bifurcating OM-1, the small mid and distal left circumflex was also supplied via retrograde flow.
The saphenous vein graft to OM had an 85% distal stenosis just proximal to the anastomosis.
The stenosis in the saphenous vein graft OM near the distal anastomosis was successfully treated by angioplasty and stenting using a 2.5 x 18 mm velocity Hepakote stent with no residual stenosis, no angiographic evidence of dissection, and TIMI-3 flow.
Left femoral groin showed no evidence of hematoma or bruit.
However, it subsequently returned showing ejection fraction of 40%, normal left ventricular wall thickness, and cavity size, regional wall motion abnormalities, including basal inferior akinesis with basal and mid inferolateral mid inferior hypokinesis, right ventricular chamber size, and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve is mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen, moderate mitral regurgitation, and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypotension are also visible.
Acute myocardial infarction status post catheterization with stent.
Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Mild systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction of 40%.
