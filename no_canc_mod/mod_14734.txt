She denied any discomfort post procedure.
While the patient mostly denied any symptoms from her low blood pressure, she at one point reported transient blurry vision while in the upright position.
The patient's symptoms resolved with a change in position and the remainder of her neurological exam was intact.
The morning of discharge, the patient was ambulating without assistance and was able to maintain blood pressures >100 without pressure support.
She was encouraged to ambulate and was discharged with instructions to call her doctor if she noticed any symptoms of hypoperfusion.
After the procedure, you required observation for low blood pressures.
