He ignored the foot for another week longer before the pain became enough that he sought medical attention.
He denied any associated symptoms besides pain in his left foot.
He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers and chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation to the emergency room he was afebrile at 97.2 degrees.
His heart rate was 96, blood pressure 118/55, respiratory rate 18, and he had a 98% saturation on room air.
He was in no acute distress.
He was taken back to the operating room on [**2180-9-13**] for debridement of his mummified left foot.
He was noted to be losing copious fluids through both groin wounds and the lower aspect of his abdominal wound.
He also had a decubitus ulcer noted, however blood cultures, urine cultures and sputum cultures remained negative.
His foot culture grew Enterococcus which was sensitive to levofloxacin that he was on.
Out of concern for ischemic bowel, the green service and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1888**] did a colonoscopy at bedside.
While his mucosa looked slightly friable, on the whole it was viable and not ischemic at any point.
The laparotomy was negative with normal-appearing colon and small bowel.
The Medical Examiner declined the case, and while the Legal Department is looking into the possibility of a court-ordered autopsy, at this point there are no plans for a postmortem examination.
