Admission Date:  [**2106-2-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-2-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2083-2-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: [**Year (4 digits) 662**]  Allergies: Prochlorperazine / Reglan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5134**] Chief Complaint: Fever, Abdominal Pain, Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Arterial line Central line Pressor support   History of Present Illness: 22-year-old female with history of gastroparesis with intermittently occuring ileus/obstruction, multiple ex-laps for obstructions who now presents to the floor from the ICU following transfer from OSH with hypotension, fevers and abdominal pain.
Over the last few months, the patient has noted an increased in the frequency of "ileus and SBO" episodes, which are generally preceded by nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
This most recent episode also began on the night of [**1-24**] with LUQ pain which is present at baseline as a dull ache, but now had a "sharp, gnawing quality" and occasionally traveled to the right.
She denies any changes in the pain with position.
She also began to experience nausea and vomiting, which was non-bloody, non bilious.
She presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-25**], where she was initially imaged for evidence of intususception.
Over the next few days, the patient began to feel much better from a pain and N/V standpoint and asked to start clears on [**2-2**].
However, on [**2-3**], the patient spiked a low grade temperature to 100.9 and worsening abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
She then became hypotensive and was given 2L of IVF and was started on Vanc/Gent/Zosyn.
While in the ICU, labs drawn demonstrated a marked pancytopenia, abnormal diff (elevated monocytes, atypical cells) a transaminitis with elevated alkaline phosphatase, coagulopathy (high INR, PT and PTT), low AM cortisol (2.4) and modestly elevated lipase (73).
Past Medical History: PMHx: GERD, Dumping Syndrome, pancreatitis, gastroparesis (failed Domperidon), bile reflux.
[**2102-1-10**] Feeding jejunostomy, open, and placement of a left subclavian for venous access.
Has very supportive friends and family (mom, dad, sisters).
Family History: Mom has asthma and father is healthy.
One sister developed reflex sympathetic dystrophy but her other two sisters are healthy.
Her grandparents on the mother's side had cancer and hypertension and her paternal grandmother also had some kind of [**Last Name 499**] problem probably [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer.

No acute intra-abdominal abnormality to explain the patient's symptoms.
Trace intra-abdominal simple free fluid which is of uncertain significance.
Small right and trace left pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Nonspecific simple free fluid in the abdomen.
Brief Hospital Course: 22-year-old female with gastroparesis and multiple GI surgeries who presents from OSH with hypotension, fevers and abdominal pain concerning for sepsis.
No source for sepsis was discovered.
#Sepsis: The patient was transferred from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] where she was admitted for gastroparesis exacerbation/decompression.
Later in her admission, after the initiation of TPN via PICC, the patient developed high fevers, hypotension and tachycardia concerning for infection with septic physiology.
CXR was without evidence of consolidation.
Her abdominal exam was initially concerning although no evidence of free air was found on imaging and CT torso without evidence of acute infectious process.
Given her pancytopenia, there was also concern for viral or atypical infection.
Her monospot test was negative, and EBV serology was consistent with past EBV infection but no acute infection.
Parvovirus and herpes virus studies were pending at the time of discharge.
# Abdominal pain: On arrival to the ICU, the patient described both a LUQ pain that represented an exacerbation of baseline pain as well as a crampy periumbilical pain that was new.
Her LUQ pain was thought to be secondary to adhesions/dysmotility, whereas her new periumblical pain was thought to be due to constipation.
# Pancytopenia: The patient initially demonstrated pancytopenia with WBC count of 1.0, Hct of 21.2 and ANC of 400-600.
She was transfused 2 U of PRBC and continued on broad spectrum antibiotics.
This was felt to be most likely due to an underlying viral infection or potentially related to sepsis of unknown source.
# Transaminitis: Liver enzymes, including AST, ALT, and AlkP were elevated on transfer.
As her sepsis resolved these values all trended down, suggesting that the initial rise was likely due to shock liver in the setting of sepsis.

Miralax 17 gram Powder in Packet Sig: Seventeen (17) grams PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Sepsis with unknown source Hypotension Neutropenia  Primary: Sepsis with unknown source Hypotension Neutropenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We have not determined a cause of your infection, but we presume that the source was from the gastrointestinal tract given your complex surgical history or possibly from the PICC line and TPN.
