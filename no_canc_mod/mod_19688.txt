She was found lying on the floor with a laceration above her right eye, complaining of head pain.
There is no clear history of loss or alteration in consciousness.
There she was found to have a right temporal ICH and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
The patient herself stated she was walking and tripped and her head fell on a huge [**Doctor Last Name **].
No vertigo or dizziness preceding.
No loss of consciousness.
Per son, he is not aware of any recent illnesses.
When he was in earlier, he offered no complaints to her, but he noted that she was very agitated and confused, which is not unusual for her at bedtime.
Past Medical History: -dementia, at baseline has deficits in short term memory and requires help with all ADLs.
-psychosis -depression -anemia -diverticulosis -arthritis -trigeminal neuralgia -s/p removal of lump from left breast five or six years ago per son  Social History: She lives in [**Hospital3 **] ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]).
No history of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.
HEENT: Small sutured laceration over right eye, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Pt refused Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
No overt facial asymmetry.
Pertinent Results: Laboratory Data:  6>  12.1 <110      35  N:69.7 L:24.1 M:4.1 E:2.1 Bas:0.1  PT: 13.3  PTT: 23.6  INR: 1.2  [**Age over 90 **]|101|35 /105 4.4| 25|1.1\  Ca: 9.2 Mg: 2.4 P: 2  Carbamaz: 6.7  Imaging:  PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is no comparison.
There is vague opacity overlying the left lower lung field, with slight indentation of the lateral aspect of the left mid to lower rib.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
If the finding correlates with the site of the patient's pain, this may represent rib fracture with contusion.
Non-contrast head CT: There is a moderate-sized right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring 2.8 cm in greatest dimension.
Again seen is a small amount of subarachnoid blood insinuating between the sulci of the right frontal and temporal lobes.
There is a small right subdural hematoma.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
There is a right frontal subgaleal hematoma.
IMPRESSION: Slight increase in moderate-sized right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage compared to study of eight hours earlier.
Evaluation for an underlying mass lesion could better be obtained with MRI.
Stable small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage and small right frontal subdural hematoma.
Repeat NCHCT [**11-20**]:  no significant change, official read is pending  Brief Hospital Course: She was admitted to the neurology ICU for observation overnight.
The etiology of the bleed was thought to be most likely traumatic, but given the location, her age, history of dementia, and recent unsteadiness, she was ordered for an MRI to rule out underlying mass or amyloid angiopathy.
Essentially, the family would not want surgery no matter what the underlying etiology, or if the bleed were to worsen.
Clinically she is well, at her baseline, fluent in Italian, recognizing family members, mild left nasolabial fold flattening, no gross assymetries in motor exam, walking to the bathroom with assistance from the nurses.
