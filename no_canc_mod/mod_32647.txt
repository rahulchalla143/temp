EMS was called and she was found initially to be unresponse and apneic but with a carotid pulse.
She subsequently became pulseless and CPR was initiated at 9:40pm.
She was intubated in the field, IV access obtained, and she got 2 rounds of epi/atropine resulting in a wide complex idioventricular PEA.
After 7 mintues of CPR code was almost called, but got 5mg epinephrine with resultant regain of pulse with a wide complex idioventricular rhythym and BP 80/25.
She got a CT scan which demonstrated bilateral posterior airspace consolidations consistent with massive aspiration, no pulmonary emobli allthough evaluation of subsegmental bronchi was sub-optimal.
CT head was normal with no bleed, edema, or mass effect.
A urine tox was posative for cocaine.
Parents report this is not a chronic problem but an isolated episode.

No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolus.
Evaluation for subsegmental emboli is limited due to contrast bolus and airspace consolidation.
Bilateral posterior airspace consolidation with associated perihilar ground- glass nodular opacities consistent with severe aspiration.
Periportal edema, severe gallbladder wall edema and perihepatic and mesenteric ascites likely secondary to volume overload from resuscitation.
[**2183-1-25**] CT head: No evidence of acute intracranial pathology including hemorrhage or mass effect.
Low lung volumes with left base atelectasis.
Markedly distended stomach.
[**2183-1-27**] CXR: Improved aeration in the right upper lobe and the left mid lung zone is seen.
No new focal consolidations.
Her cardiopulmonary arrest was thought related to her recent cocaine use, either with cocaine-induced seizure, hypoxia, or primary arrhythmia.
She was found to have severe aspiration on CTA, which could have been the inciting event for her arrest, however could also have occurred during the arrest.
Given concern over the large amount of aspirated material in her lungs, a bronchoscopy was performed on [**1-27**] to evaluate for retained solid material; nothing was seen.
She was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole for empiric coverage of aspiration pneumonia and was given a 7 day course.
During the time of cooling, she developed a coagulopathy with elevated PTT/INR and dropping fibrinogen, all of which corrected with rewarming.
Her creatinine on arrival was 1.1 which rose to 1.5 after the arrest, thought secondary to prerenal azotemia; her creatinine returned to [**Location 213**] prior to discharge, along with her transaminitis which was thought secondary to shock liver.
