withdraws bilaterally in lower extrem to deep painful stim., min movement in uppers  Toes upgoing bilaterally Labs:CBC: 9.3/37.1/187 coags:INR;2.0  CT:from OSH shows intraventricular bleed in 3rd, 4th and right lateral ventricles, no intraparenchymal blood, moderate hydrocephalus.
CTA here shows extension of intraventricular bleed with increased hydrocephalus, no obvious aneurysm seen.

EKG showed pt was in atrial fibrillation.
Dilated ventricles with large intraventricular hemorrhage.
No aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation identified.
Follow-up CT showed Interval placement of left frontal approach intraventricular catheter, which terminates in the left lateral ventricle, near the intraventricular foramen.
Slight interval decrease in degree of hydrocephalus.
Pt was placed on Ancef for empiric coverage while the drain was in.
Overnight the EVD was flushed multiple times for failure to drain.
AM CT showed Interval mild increase in degree of ventricular dilatation compared to the study of one day prior.
Bilateral ventricular drains.
Hematoma within the tracts of the bilateral ventricular drains in the frontal horns related to placement of these drains.
HD3 Head CT showed 1) Stable appearance of bifrontal approach intraventricular catheters with interval decrease in size of left lateral ventricle.
The right lateral ventricle also appears slightly decreased in size.
However, there has been interval shift of the septum pellucidum to the left.
2) Stable appearance of large amount of intraventricular hemorrhage and hemorrhage along the catheter tracts.
No evidence of stenosis or aneurysm.
Pt spiked a fever that day.
CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Sputum and blood cx showed no growth.
HD5 Head CT showed No significant interval change compared to the study of one day prior.
BIlateral CSF cultures were sent showing no growth.
Oxacillin was discontinued and vancomycin was started for gram positive coverage.
CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Bilateral lower extremity dopplers showed no evidence of DVT.
Head CT showed Increased size of the lateral and third ventricles since the CT scan of [**2166-10-5**], and possibly slightly increased lateral ventricular size since [**2166-10-8**].
THe ICU team noted that the pt had a rash on his back.
CXR showed Improving left lower lobe atelectasis.
Small right-sided pleural effusion.
Head CT showed Both studies show extensive quantities of fluid within the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses with additional opacification seen within the mastoid sinuses, along with tiny air fluid levels in the latter locale.
Presumably, these findings represent retained secretions secondary to intubation.
Head CT showed No interval change in the size of the bifrontal intraparenchymal hemorrhages or the degree of hydrocephalus.
Unchanged sinus disease as described above.
EVD was placed for worsening hydrocephalus seen on previous CTs and to evaluate patients response.
HD#19 Pateint neurologic exam has not improved since the right extraventriculostomy drain placed on [**10-15**].
Patient extubated [**2166-10-17**] at 1500, placed on a morphine gtt for comfort measures only, and right extraventriculostomy drain removed and surgical wound closed with staples.
