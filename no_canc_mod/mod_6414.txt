Admission Date: [**2150-7-14**]        Discharge Date: [**2150-8-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2078-7-19**]        Sex:  M  Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old man with history of coronary artery disease, status post a large anterior myocardial infraction in [**1-8**], as well as a stent of his RCA for severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
The patient awoke feeling pressure across his chest "like a weight on my chest" with associated shortness of breath.
The shortness of breath lasted 1 hour, at which time chest pressure diminished in intensity.
The patient denies orthopnea, PND, or decreased exercise tolerance.
He states that his lower extremity edema is normal for him.
He denies fevers or chills, nausea or vomiting, urinary symptoms, cough, weight loss, change in appetite, arthritis, rash, abdominal pain, or history of trauma.
Congestive heart failure.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General:  A well- appearing, disheveled man in no acute distress.
Jugular venous distention to approximately 10 cm.
Extremities:  A 3 plus pitting edema bilaterally with hyperpigmentation consistent with chronic venous insufficiency, right worse than left.
RADIOLOGY DATA:  Chest x-ray reveals interval development of polychamber cardiomegaly versus pericardial effusion, no pulmonary edema.
EKG, normal sinus rhythm at 74 beats per minute, normal axis, LAE, no electrical alterans.
No right ventricle collapse in diastole and no diastolic right atrial collapse, right atrial invagination present, mild respiratory variation in transmitral valve, transtricuspid valve inflow, no tamponade, 2 plus mitral regurgitation.
CT scan with nonionic contrast revealed a left-sided anterior mediastinal mass, contiguous and inseparable from the pericardial effusion.
It also revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules.
There was also a possible left cavitary lung mass or possibly a loculated pleural effusion.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2150-7-15**] for this procedure, which he tolerated well with minimal blood loss.
Pericardial biopsy was sent to pathology and a caseating mediastinal mass was noted in the findings of this procedure.
They suggested that he may be a candidate for an endovascular AAA repair, but would need a CT angiogram protocol to study and assess the position/size of the AAA.
Mediastinal cyst wall was interpreted as fragments of detached highly atypical keratinizing squamous epithelium and also a foreign body giant cell reaction.
Pericardium fibroadipose tissue with local fibrin deposition and reactive mesothelial reaction.
Mediastinal cyst wall contents, superficial squamous epithelium and keratinous debris.
A note on this pathology result, invasion of tumor cells into the surrounding stroma is not seen.
Differential diagnoses include a thymic cyst with carcinoma in situ, thymic carcinoma with a squamous differentiation, and a metastatic process.
A cytology report for the pericardial fluid was negative for malignant cells.
Because of the caseating mass found during the surgery, tuberculosis was suspected, although all of the cultures were negative.
FURTHER WORKUP:  Because the pathologic specimens were nondiagnostic and the bilateral pulmonary nodules were not biopsied at that time, a decision was made in cooperation with Medical service as well as the consulting Oncology service to perform a video-assisted wedge resection of at least 1 of the nodules for definitive diagnosis.
The patient was taken to the operative room on [**2150-7-23**] for a left video-assisted wedge resection, a biopsy and lysis of adhesions as well as an insertion of a chest tube and bronchoscopy.
Once back on the floor, the patient was noted to have a persistent air leak and as his medical, oncological, and vascular issues stabilized and the only remaining problem remained his chest tube, he was transferred to the Thoracic service where we followed him almost exclusively for the management of his persistent air leak.
The patient continued to have a small pneumothorax on the left, which only resolved slightly when put to suction from water seal.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
