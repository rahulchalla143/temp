[**2171-10-18**] TTE : Mildly dilated right ventricle with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation  [**2171-10-23**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1.
Bibasilar consolidation containing air bronchograms concerning for infection.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Esophageal distention and gastric distention likely due to positioning of the tip of the NG tube within the jejunal limb of the gastrojejunostomy.
Free fluid within the peritoneal cavity, but no fluid collections or findings concerning for abscess.
Possible partial or complete obstruction of the gastrojejunostomy with oral contrast within the stomach and going up to the thoracic inlet within the esophagus.
Suctioning of the NG tube is recommended to prevent aspiration of the oral contrast.
Bilateral ground-glass opacities likely represent sequelae of aspiration, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Air within the bladder is likely secondary to Foley catheter.
No stenosis, obstruction or leak.
No contrast in stomach.
Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2171-11-12**]):    NO GROWTH.
Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood cultures          positive for Staphylococcus aureus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] species.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN SHORT CHAINS.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**2171-10-17**], the patient was started on piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole and transferred emergently to the operating theatre for perforated viscus, given peritoneal signs and significant free intra-abdominal air.
Intra-operatively, the patient sustained two brief episodes of asystole so the stomach and colon were left in discontinuity and the abdomen remained open for a staged operation.
Cardiology was consulted, and his episodes of asystole were assessed as severe bradycardia secondary to vagal stimulation during manipulation of the viscera.
Troponins were normal, showing no signs of myocardial ischemia.
ECG showed sinus bradycardia without acute changes.
Unfortunately he went back to the ICU on [**2171-10-26**] as he had a series of problems which culminated with rigors and a temperature of 101.1, desaturation to 77% on 5LNC and a chest CT consistent with aspiration.
His atrial fibrillation was short lived and he then continued on Lopressor.
From a cardiovascular standpoint he had no other problems during his recovery.
His bowel function was very slow to return presumed secondary to edema around the anastomosis.
His surgical wound was healing well and his ostomy was pink and in time began to function.
He underwent frequent clamping trials with his nasogastric tube, initially failing but in time successful.
He gradually was started on liquids and over 48 hours was advanced to regular without any nausea or vomiting.
He developed a high fever again on [**2171-11-6**] with an elevated WBC of 19K.
One of two blood cultures was positive for coag positive staph aureus, strep viridans and coag negative staph.
