Admission Date:  [**2196-10-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-10-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-8-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Tegretol / Dilantin Kapseal / Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13017**] Chief Complaint: Seizure/Possible GI Bleed   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: This is a 67 year old man with history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease (s/p multilple stents and CABG in [**2189**]), seizure disorder (on lamotrigine only), macrocytic anemia, who initially presented to the ED after finding himself down on the ground.
During his initial presentation to the ED he was not complaining of any problems other than facial pain.
While in the ED he had a seizure ( described as Jerking Tonic/Clonic, generlized, with face deviating to the left, looked like grand-mal, brief).
Epistaxis running down back of his throat.
He had an episode of coffee-ground emesis.
At this time Patient was not given any medications other than glucose to correct his episode of hypoglycemia.
Nurse also noted "compartment syndrome in left forearm" - could be IV infiltrating, and patient is not complaining of painin that arm.
- Seizure - 40 minutes prior to transfer.
- Prior to transfer, the patient had another episode of seizure, and was given ativan and sent for another CT scan of his head to rule out bleed.
No acute cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
Mild degenerative changes, worst at C4-C5.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Bilateral nasal bone fractures and nasal septal fracture.
New mild bifrontal prominence of CSF spaces.
The patient then was reportedly worse, had another seizure, was given a total of 4 ativan IV, noted to have worsening mental status.
ED was concerned for evolving intracranial process, and repeated CT, which was unchanged.
Past Medical History: - DM-1: for almost 50 years, he has neuropathy and retinopathy.
without stent placement.
- GTC Seizures (wife describes that normal semiology = "lets out a cry," shakes all limbs for ~30 sec, groggy afterwards): ?
No family history of arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, pupils 4mm, reactive to light, Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD, Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU:  foley  in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, with the exception of his left arm, but radial is dopplerable.
Skin Exam: Small abrasion on top of scalp, several excoriative, well healed lesions throughout.
Power: Strong withdrawal in legs and arms.
Cannot exclude myocardial ischemia.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 63 144 102 460/465 76 17 87  CT Head without contrast: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage edema, shift of midline structures or major vascular territorial infarction.
There is new bifrontal prominence of the CSF spaces, likely representing old subdural hematoma or CSF hygroma.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related atrophy.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the carotid and vertebral arteries are noted.
There are fractures of the bilateral nasal bones and nasal septum.
There is mild mucosal thickening and a mucus-retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Bilateral nasal bone fractures and nasal septal fracture.
New mild bifrontal prominence of CSF spaces.
CT C-spine without contrast: FINDINGS: There is no acute fracture, dislocation, or malalignment of the cervical spine.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue edema.
There is a posterior disc-osteophyte complex at C4-C5 causing mild spinal canal narrowing.
There is mild facet spondylosis on the left at this level.
The visualized portions of the lung apices again demonstrate chronic fibrotic changes in the medial aspect of the left lung.
There is no cervical lymphadenopathy.
There are bilateral atherosclerotic calcifications of the carotid bifurcations.
No acute cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
Mild degenerative changes, worst at C4-C5.
Head CT without contrast - repeat: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, shift of midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarction.
Again noted is bifrontal prominence of the CSF spaces, likely representing old subdural hematomas or CSF hygromas.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related atrophy.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the carotid and vertebral arteries are again noted.
There are fractures of the bilateral nasal bones and nasal septum.
There is mild mucosal thickening and a mucus retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Bilateral nasal bone fractures and nasal septal fracture.
Minimal indistinctness of pulmonary vessels raises the possibility of increased pulmonary venous pressure.
There is suggestion of some increased opacification at the right base and in the retrocardiac region on this side.
This could merely reflect crowded vessels or atelectasis and a lateral view would be ideal if clinically possible to better assess for possible pneumonia.
ECG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature depolarization.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Rightward precordial R wave transition point.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2196-10-17**] there is no diagnostic change.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 74 142 102 448/472 59 49 110    Brief Hospital Course: This is a 67 year old man with history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease (s/p multilple stents and CABG in [**2189**]), seizure disorder (on lamotrigine only), macrocytic anemia, who initially presented to the ED after finding himself down on the ground, became more unresponsive and confused after witnessed seizures, now in the MICU, responsive only to painful stimuly.
# Altered Mental status - due to post-ictal state.
The patient returned to his baseline mental status.
# Seizure disorder - The etiology of his fall was most likely due to low blood sugars.
Of note, Lamictal level has now come back and shows a level of 2.3.
# Nasal fracture - The patient arrived to the ED with bloody mouth and nose.
CT shows that he fractured his bilateral nasal bones and nasal septum.
# Coffee-ground emesis - had o/ne episode of what was described as coffee- ground emesis, after the seizure.
He is Guaiac negative and his likely source of bleeding is epistaxis given trauma of his face.
- GI consulted - HCT remained stable - no further emesis .
**** OF NOTE - In regard to future ED Visits: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] has a strong history of having generalized seizures early in the morning when his blood glucose is low.
: ativan 1mg IV q6 hours) in order to prevent further generalized seizures within 24 hours.
This is important as when the patient has several seizures within a 24 hour period, he becomes very somnolent for days due to a post-ictal state.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: seizure nasal fracture  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital after a fall, suspected to be due to a seizure related to low blood glucose.
Please avoid swimming for at least the next 6 months to ensure your safety as it would be extremely dangerous and possibly deadly if you were to have a seizure while swimming.
Likewise, it is [**State 350**] state law that anyone who has suffered a loss of consciousness such as a seizure, may not drive until they have been seizure-free for at least 6 months.
Unfortunately, your fall prior to admission resulted in a fracture of your nose.
The plastic surgeon team was consulted and are concerned that you may need a closed reduction of your nasal bone in order to prevent breathing problems in the future.
