FINDINGS: There is no malalignment within the lumbar spine.
There is no loss of vertebral body, or intervertebral disc space height.
At L5, there is a comminuted fracture through the left transverse process, extending into the left inferior articular process .
Comminuted fractures are seen involving bilateral sacral alae, with angulation of the iliac bones laterally.
The surrounding soft tissues reveal a large amount of intrapelvic ascites, and subcutaneous edema.
This heterogeneous enhancement of the spleen consistent with patient's known splenic laceration.
IMPRESSION: Multiple fractures of the lumbar spine including L1 through L5 right transverse processes, L5 left transverse process and inferior articular facet.
Additionally, comminuted fractures are seen through both sacral alae, adjacent to left S1 nerve root foramen.
FINDINGS: Hyperdense material was seen within the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinuses, straight and sigmoid sinuses.
While this is most likely related to prior contrast administration, an underlying subarachnoid hemorrhage cannot definitively be ruled out.
There is no presence of subdural or epidural hematoma.
There is no major vascular territorial infarction.
The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures reveal clips along the right parietal scalp.
There is dense opacification of bilateral maxillary sinuses, and mild opacification of the sphenoid sinuses and ethmoid air cells.
Hyperdense material within the sinuses most likely represents prior contrast administration.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2163-10-14**] 1:00 PM  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  Reason: Trauma MVC S/P Ex-lap Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 18 year old woman with REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Trauma MVC S/P Ex-lap CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 18-year-old female status post motor vehicle accident and exploratory laparotomy.
There is no pericardial effusion.
High-density material directly posterior to the sternum is most consistent with a hematoma.
On lung windows, there is a right- sided moderately large hemothorax.
Patchy consolidations within bilateral lungs, but mainly within the right posterior lung are consistent with contusions.
There is a residual small left anterior pneumothorax.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The patient is status post exploratory laparotomy with an open abdominal wound, diastasis of the anterior abdominal wall with multiple exposed loops of large and small bowel covered by a mesh.
The liver enhances normally, and there is no evidence of active contrast extravasation surrounding the liver.
Both adrenal glands are enlrrged, likely due to hematoma.
Heterogeneous enhancement of the spleen is consistent with partial devascularization.
There is no evidence of active contrast extravasation surrounding the spleen.
Additionally, there is a laceration involving the upper pole of the left kidney, which appears to extend through the cortex and medulla.
No contrast extravasation is seen within the fluid surrounding the kidney.
There is dense fluid throughout the abdomen consistent with blood.
BONE WINDOWS: There is an open-book fracture of the pelvis involving the left ischium, bilateral superior pubic rami, and bilateral sacral alae.
There are multiple fractures along the L1 through L5 right transverse processes.
Additionally, there is a fracture through the T12 right superior facet joint.
There are multiple right posterior rib fractures, including T6 through T9.
Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial findings.
Status post exploratory laparotomy, with diastasis of the anterior abdominal wall containing multiple normal-appearing loops of large and small bowel.
No evidence of active contrast extravasation surrounding the liver, spleen, or left kidney.
Known open book pelvic fracutre without signs to suggest bladder or major vessel injury.
Grade III to IV splenic laceration with probable devascularization of the inferior pole.
Cortical and medullary laceration involving the upper pole of left kidney, without active contrast extravasation on this expiratory phase CT.  7.
Right hemothorax with diffuse lung contusion.
Status post left chest tube placement, with tip at left lung apex with small residual left anterior pneumothorax.
Bilateral adrenal hematomas versus adenomas.
Multiple right-sided rib fractures, including the posterior 6-9th ribs.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2163-10-25**] 9:50 PM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: eval for placement of duotube  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 18 year old woman s/p trauma with L diaphragm rupture s/p repair.
There has been interval removal of a left subclavian line with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Interval development of mild increase in pulmonary vasculature and pulmonary edema.
Mild left lower lobe atelectasis.
Interval development of mild pulmonary edema.
GALLBLADDER SCAN  [**2163-10-25**]  GALLBLADDER SCAN  Reason: PT WITH FEVER,ELEVATED LFT'S ,ON TPN PLEASE EVAL FOR CHOLECYSTITIS  HISTORY: 18 yo F with fever, elevated LFTs, on TPN.
The above findings are consistent with no evidence of cholecystitis.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
Orthopedics was consulted because of her multiple orthopedic injuries; she was later taken to the operating room on [**10-17**] for repair of her pelvis, right femur and right ulna.
Speech and Swallow was consulted because of dysphagia and have recommended a clear diet with advancement to regular diet with strict aspiration precautions.
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for breakthrough pain.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 6-8 hours as needed for anxiety.
