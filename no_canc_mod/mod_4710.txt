Hypoxic respiratory failure.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome.
Atrial fibrillation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old male with a past medical history significant for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and prostate cancer who was transferred from the [**Hospital3 3583**] for further treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure.
The patient was admitted to the an outside hospital on [**2145-1-29**] with complaints of increased dyspnea times one to two weeks with diaphoresis and chest pain with cough and no fevers or chills.
The patient's dyspnea progressed to shortness of breath while at rest.
The patient's family noted that two other family members were also suffering from shortness of breath and cough, both were hospitalized with pneumonia.
Chest x-ray revealed small right lower lobe and left lower lobe infiltrates.
The patient was afebrile with a white blood cell count of 12.8, a blood pressure of 86/40 with a heart rate of 130, 97% 02 saturation on four liters.
The patient's oxygen requirement continued to worsen with increase opacifications on chest x-ray.
The patient was intubated on [**2-5**] for hypoxic respiratory failure.
A CT scan was obtained revealing diffuse ground glass opacities with extensive  emphysematous changes without lymphadenopathy or tumor seen.
In addition, the patient was reported to have had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requiring diltiazem drip but the patient spontaneously cardioverted to sinus rhythm and arrived to the [**Hospital6 2018**] without a diltiazem drip.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
OG tube was in place with no jugular venous distention.
Lungs:  Expiratory wheezes over the left posterior hemithorax, crackles over the right posterior hemithorax, half way up.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs or rubs, no S3 or S4.
Extremities:  No edema.
Neurologically: Sedated with a positive gag.
A Gram stain sputum from [**2-2**]:  Moderate epithelial cells, moderate gram positive rods, moderate gram positive cocci, moderate pleomorphic gram negative rods.
CT scan of the chest on [**2-5**]:  Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis, emphysematous changes bilaterally diffusely with occasional large bulla, diffuse ground glass appearance.
Chest x-ray on [**2-5**]:  Diffuse opacities bilaterally without pneumothorax and normal heart size.
COURSE IN THE HOSPITAL:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Intensive Care Unit on a ventilator for treatment of pneumonia and presumed adult respiratory distress syndrome.
Respiratory for hypoxic respiratory failure.
The patient was continued on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes and pressures with PEEP for presumed adult respiratory distress syndrome.
A bronchoscopy was performed which revealed nonspecific changes.
Multiple cultures were sent including a bronchoscopy sample which was negative for pneumocystis and legionella and positive for [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
On [**2145-2-14**], the patient was hypotensive and hypothermic and was felt to be septic and a question of vent acquired pneumonia was raised.
The patient continued to have temperatures and despite multiple cultures and changing of access lines, the patient's cultures remained negative.
He was given intravenous fluids as necessary for hypotension.
During the week of [**2145-2-21**], the patient's pressor requirement remained high requiring large doses of Neo-Synephrine which were unable to be weaned previously in the patient's course, his pressor requirement was intermittent but during the days between [**2-21**] and [**2-25**], the patient's pressor requirements remained steady and high and he was unable to be weaned to lower doses.
Atrial fibrillation:  The patient developed periods of atrial fibrillation throughout the course of the hospitalization.
One episode was associated with hypotension and the patient was attempted for DC cardioversion.
By [**2145-2-25**], attempts to diurese the patient with Lasix were met with hypotension and episodes of atrial fibrillation as described above.
Access:  The patient received central lines for administration of intravenous medications and arterial lines for hemodynamic monitoring.
On [**2145-2-19**], during a routine change of the patient's central line for question infection, the patient suffered a complication of internal jugular catheter placement.
He had a tension pneumothorax with hypotension and decreased oxygen saturations.
The patient's family was informed of these complications and he suffered no further complications from the chest tube.
