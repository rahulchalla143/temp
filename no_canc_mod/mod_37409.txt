Admission Date:  [**2149-10-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-11-6**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Diphenhydramine / Isordil / Meclizine / Amoxicillin / Hydrochlorothiazide / Ceclor / Hydroxyzine / Doxepin / Zantac / Corgard / Prinivil / Vasotec / Digoxin / Prilosec / Cozaar / Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**] Chief Complaint: GIB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD  History of Present Illness: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with PVD s/p recent fem-fem bypass who presents with GI bleeding.
According to the patient's family she was feeling well until yesterday when she acted more weak and related mild nausea with associated gagging.
Today she had a large black bowel movement with fresh BRB and clots and felt weak, fatigued, clammy, nauseous, and SOB.
No hemetemesis, LH, abdominal pain, diarrhea or fevers.
Per the patient's daughters, the patient had been in significant amount of pain after her surgery on [**10-6**] but did not like how percocet made her feel.
In the ED patient had maroon blood in vault and positive NGL (coffee ground initially, then BRB, then coffee ground which cleared after 2L).
She was afebrile with BP 130/81 but her HCT was found to be 23 from last [**Location (un) 1131**] of 28 on [**10-12**] (baseline 40's prior to surgery, low 30's after surgery but trended down to 28 prior to d/c) and she was tachycardic (120).
Patient was found to be in Afib with RVR to 120 and EKG was concerning for ST depressions in lateral leads (V4-V6) as well as I, II, aVF - cardiology consulted and felt likely demand ischemia in setting of RVR and GIB and recommended aggressive transfusion.
No h/o smoking.
No h/o illegal drug use.

EGD [**2149-10-26**]: Impression: Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus Erythema, congestion and erosion in the antrum and stomach body compatible with erosive gastritis Ulcers in the duodenal bulb (thermal therapy) Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum     Brief Hospital Course: # GIB - Initially felt to be UGIB in setting of melena, +NGL, NSAIDs (ulcer, gastritis, esophagitis, AVM), but likely brisk as patient had BRBPR.
Had EGD on [**10-25**] with demonstrated 2 duodenal ulcers, one with visible bleeding vessel that was cauterized.
She had drops in hematocrits several times and had two further EGDs with hemostasis cautery applied.
She was transfered to the floor where she did have several dark stools but had a stable HCt and they were felt to be residual blood.
# CAD - Lateral ischemic changes on EKG, likely due to demand ischemia in setting of GIB and Afib with RVR.
Repeat EKG when rate controlled showed no further ischemic changes.
# Afib with RVR - Likely precipitated by GI bleed.
Allowed pt to be tachycardic while having GI bleed because wanted to avoid lowering BP.
No anticoagulation (not on coumadin as outpt d/t h/o hematoma) .
