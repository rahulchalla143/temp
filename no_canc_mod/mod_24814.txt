The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.There is no pericardial effusion.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY :[**2184-7-10**] There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 % secondary to hypokinesis of the septum, anterior free wall, and apex.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
There is "critical" aortic valve stenosis (valve orifice area approximately 0.7 cm2) (may have low flow/low gradient component).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax.
Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
New right upper lobe opacity could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema but aspiration is also a possibility .
Right pleural effusion .
Chest X Ray:[**2184-7-14**]: Mild pulmonary edema in the left lung is unchanged.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left, is stable.
No pneumothorax.
Continued evidence of elevation of pulmonary venous pressure with bilateral pleural effusions.
It is difficult to determine whether the opacification in the right perihilar region reflects elevation of venous pressure or possibly a supervening focus of pneumonia.
Patent right-sided biliary system without evidence for leak or stenosis.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY :[**2184-7-27**] There is trace aortic regurgitation.
Left ventricular systolic function is depressed with apical, mid to distal anteroseptal, anterior and inferior hypokinesis (although regional wall motion was not fully assessed).
The increment in aortic valve orifice area is most likely explained by improved left ventricular contractile function (low flow/low gradient aortic stenosis) .
CHEST X RAY:[**2184-7-29**] IMPRESSION: Worsening pulmonary edema with increasing perihilar opacities and moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions.
MR head [**2184-8-6**] Small layering of old blood in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of both lateral ventricles with findings suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus.
No mass effect or midline shift.
MRA brain demonstrates non-visualization of distal right vertebral artery which may be due to this artery ending in PICA or due to occlusion in neck.
There is subtle flow signal narrowing at right MCA bifurcation which may be artifactual or due to mild atherosclerotic disease.
No evidence of aneurysms or vessel occlusions.
Chest Xray:[**2184-8-16**] Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened since [**8-15**], accompanied by moderate to large bilateral pleural effusion, increased on the right, stable on the left.
Heart is borderline enlarged, but the improvement in previous mediastinal vascular engorgement suggests a decrease in intravascular volume or pressure.
No pneumothorax.
No pneumothorax.
Upper extremity USG:[**2184-8-16**] No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right arm.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45%).

There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-7-29**], the right ventricle is seen reasonably well on the current study and appears mildly dilated/hypokinetic.
The degree of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation are similar.
There is diffuse hazy opacity throughout both lungs which likely represents CHF with interstitial and alveolar edema, as well as bilateral layering effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.

Neuro:The patient had an episode of pupillary asymmetry, reactive bilaterally, and decreased R arm movementon [**8-6**].
MRI showed evidence of communicating hydrocephalus without midline shift, intraventricular fluid collections; LP did not show evidence of anyacute SAH or infection.As per neurology, it is not possible todelineate the time course of this patient's hydrocephalus, which could be chronic or subsequent to resolved SAH or infection over the course of her multiple hospitalizations.
However she failed to improve even after her tracheostomy.Her chest Xray over the last 2 months showed increasing pulmonary edema.She also developed repeated pleural effusions that were drained thrice during her hospital stay.Her pleural fluid were negative on culture.On the day of discharge she was on a regimen with CPAP during the day and CMV during the night.
CVS: The patient was started on pressors (phenyleperine,vasopressin and Milrinone) postoperatively for hypotension which were subsequently weaned off.Her ECHO on [**2184-7-10**] showed LVEF= 35-40 % secondary to hypokinesis of the septum, anterior free wall, and apex.She underwent a aortic valvuloplasty on [**2184-7-27**] for a AS w/ [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.6 cm2 pre valvuoplasty and 0.7 cm2 post valvuoplasty.Her EF remained low to 40% on her most recent ECHO on [**2184-8-26**].
GI:The patient underwent a roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy performed [**7-9**].However she went to septic shock post op and was started on tubefeeds via dobhoff.She underwent a cholangiogram on [**7-19**] which showed no leak.
GU:The patient went into acute renal failure.However over the course the patient recovered spontanously with IVF resuciataion.
The patient also had C diff infection for which she recieved flagyl for 12 days.The patient also recieved fluconazole for positive fungal cultures from urine.The patient also had positive coag.
Hematology: The patient recieved multiple blood transfusions postoperatively after her gastrojujenostomy.Her Hct has been largely stable since then.
