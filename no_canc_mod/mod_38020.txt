[**2124-6-5**] R FOOT FILM IMPRESSION: 1.
Soft tissue swelling and dorsal ulceration along the mid foot overlapping the cuneiforms.
No definite radiographic evidence for acute osteomyelitis.
Irregularity involving the base of the fifth proximal phalanx which is stable since the prior study and may represent a subacute fracture.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 79M with a history of ESRD on HD (ANCA-related GN) and DM with recent admission for fever without clear source who presented to the ED with worsening RLE cellulitis, improving on IV Vanc and Ceftazidime.
Acute issues: # RLE cellulitis and bacteremia: The patient's clinical findings and leukocytosis to 27.0 with bandemia were most suggestive of a soft tissue infection though there was no evidence of systemic toxicity in the form of fevers.
Blood cultures grew out pan-sensitive Serratia while would culture from his right foot ulcer grew out both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia.
The patient was treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn for his cellulitis as well as Tylenol for pain; the patient's cellulitis improved significantly with antibiotics and the patient was able to ambulate with assistance.
#Hematochezia: The patient had 8 episodes of BRBPR during this hospitalization.
Given the intermittent nature of these episodes, they were may have been due to hemorrhoids although the patient has a history of severe diverticulosis and AVMs.
On hospital day 3, the patient experienced further episodes of BRBPR overnight without hypotension or tachycardia.
The BRBPR continued into the following day with an episode associated with some dizziness and pre-syncope.
He did not have any further BRBPR and remained hemodynamically stable throughout.
# ESRD on HD: MWF HD schdule.
Patient was significantly volume overloaded at admission, but improved with HD.
# Dyspnea: Patient was initially dyspneic at admission due to volume overload in the setting of his ESRD.
CXR on [**6-6**] showed significant improvement of his initial pulmonary edema as did his clinical exam.
Patient did not report any problems regarding his breathing at discharge.
The patient was not on insulin or oral agents at home, but his blood sugars were monitored closely and maintained on an insulin sliding scale given his infection and prednisone use.
Per the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient was previously hyperglycemic in the setting of infection and prednisone.
