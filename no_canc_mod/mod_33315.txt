According to the patient's husband, starting on [**10-29**] the patient began complaining of a severe, constant left sided headache.
The headache persisted, but this morning she was able to go to work.
Intubated and sedated - unable to obtain ROS   Past Medical History: - Depression - Hx of diverticulitis   Social History: Lives in [**Location 3320**] with her husband and 6 cats.

No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Reportedly previously was moving all extremities, R>L, but was reported to be able to localize to pain with both right and left arms.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2197-11-8**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Parenchymal hemorrhage involving the lateral aspect of the left lentiform nucleus and external capsule, extending into the left subinsular region.
The hemorrhagic focus is noted to dissect transependymally and appears within the left lateral ventricle, with mass effect and rightward shift of midline structures.
No evidence of extravasation at the margins of the parenchymal hemorrhage, to specifically predict expansion.
There is no flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion in bilateral internal carotid arteries and vertebral arteries.
No evidence of AVM or vascular anomaly or aneurysm greater than 2 mm.
No evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis.
Unchanged left basal ganglia hemorrhage with intraventricular extent.
Similar mass effect, edema, and right subfalcine herniation.
CT [**11-4**]: Left basal ganglia hemorrhage with extension into the left lateral ventricle has slightly decreased in size.
There has been interval decrease in mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
There is no evidence of herniation.
The basal cistern and suprasellar cisterns appear patent.
There has been interval increase in opacification of the paranasal sinuses with significant opacification of sphenoid sinuses, ethmoid sinus air cells and maxillary sinuses, this is likely sequelae of recent intubation.
No osseous lesion to suggest malignancy or infection is seen.
There are low lung volumes.
Discoid atelectasis in the left mid lung has resolved.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
No pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
Mild bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No significant radiographic change since [**11-4**], [**2196**].
There are low lung volumes.
Bibasilar atelectasis, greater on the left side has minimally increased.
CXR [**11-13**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2196-11-15**], there is ill-defined opacification in the right apical region that cannot all be explained by bony structures.
There also is a vague suggestion of soft tissue prominence to the left of the superior mediastinum.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt is a 47 year-old woman with a history of depression and 2 days of headache, found to have a 2.5x6cm L basal ganglia hemorrhage on CT.
The patient does not have a known history of hypertension, but did have readings as high as 195/112 at [**Hospital3 3583**].
Given the origin in the basal ganglia, would suspect this represents a hypertensive hemorrhage.
Given concern of hydrocephalus she was started on aggressive diuresis with mannitol and Lasix.
her condition gradually improved, she had significant weakness on her right side both in UE and LE on examination, however there was some improvement over the course of her stay.She was later transferred to neuro floor on [**11-11**] after successful extubation.
The patient should have a follow up MRI with contrast in [**11-18**] months after discharge to ensure that there is not an underlying lesion which caused the initial hemorrhage.
Neurosurgery requested a head CT in one month to assess progression of bleeding and hydrocephalus.
Her repeat chest x ray did not show appearance of new opacity.
She developed diarrhea since [**11-11**].
Pulmo After extubation, she was noted to have mild stridor and she had difficulty in getting voice out due to stridor.
CVS Over the course of her stay her blood pressure was well controlled other than few episodes of HTN which later resolved, and she did not require any antihypertensive agents.
Physical exam at DC Alert, awake, mildly inattentive, hoarse voice with aphasia, (able to repeat intermittently; naming is inaccurate, paraphasic errors; dysarthric but fluent) Right facial droop , no clear field cut, and right hemiplegia  Pending Issues at Discharge:  1.
Urine metanephrine pending at DC, done as a work up for episodic HTN given her lack of prior history of hypertension.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: [**11-18**]  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sob, wheeze.
Glucagon (Human Recombinant) 1 mg Recon Soln Sig: One (1) Recon Soln Injection Q15MIN () as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital of [**Location (un) **] & Islands - [**Location (un) 6251**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left basal ganglia hemorrhage, likely hypertensive Pneumonia, treated   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness:Lethargic but arousable Activity Status: Out of bed to chair, PT as tolerated   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after you were found collapsed at your desk at work.
An image of your head was obtained and you wre found to have a bleed on the left side, deep in your brain tissue.
In addition your hospital course was complicated by a pnemonia for which you recieved antibiotics.
You are also requested to return in 1 month with a head CT to ensure there is not worsening of the pressure in your brain.
Please call your doctor if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or any of the symptoms listed below please call yor doctor or return to the nearest emergency room.
