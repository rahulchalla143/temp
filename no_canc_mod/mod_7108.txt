USOH at nursing home until last night when began to have [**9-2**] substernal CP, no interventions performed at the time.
Morning of admission, presented to cardiologist ([**Doctor Last Name 11493**]) office, where EKG revealed 3-4mm ST elevations in anteroseptal leads, Echo 20-25%.
Sent to [**Location (un) **] ED (chest pain free, 12 hrs after onset of CP), CK 1043, MB 123, TnI 45.17.

Anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction Patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] approximately 16 hours after the intial onset of [**7-3**] substernal chest pain.
However given the patient's age, the extent of coronary artery disease, and late presentation, the patient was not deemed a suitable candidate for cardiac catherization and was tranferred to the CCU for medical management.
EKG from the OSH showed T wave inversions and Q waves in V1-V3.
An echo done at the [**Hospital1 **], showed an EF of 15-20%, and depressed left ventricular systolic function.
Throughout his course patient was medically managed for his coronary artery disease with aspirin, lipitor and plavix.
Cardiac enzymes trended downward and with gentle diuresis patient's cardiac index improved to 3.15. .
Aflutter The patient's initial course was complicated on the day of presentation by atrial flutter, with HR>150.
Early in the hospital course the patient was asymptomatic during these episodes and would revert back into normal sinus rhythm.
However this was later held due to elevated INRs.
Hypotension On [**2176-6-19**], the patient became acutely hypotensive, SBP's 70s-80s.
An echo revealed no cardiac effusion (s/p day 1 cardiac ablation).
An EKG was done which showed no significant changes.
The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and esophageal strictures requiring dilatation.
The patient did not show evidence of aspiration during the study.
The patient was noted to have an extremely discoordinated oral phase.
6.Hypoxia .On [**2176-6-22**], the patient became acutely hypoxic, desatting to 89% on 4L.
A CXR showed bilateral effusions, left lower lobe collapse, consolidation, and mild background of CHF.
Infection .
On the day of admission the patient was continued on Flagyll due to a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia from the nursing home.
Stool cultures later came back positiove for C. diff.
The patient expired within the next 36 hours secondary to respiratory arrest/hypoxia.
