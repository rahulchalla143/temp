Admission Date:  [**2197-1-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-2-13**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tetanus Antitoxin / Penicillins / Ethambutol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath.
History of Present Illness: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of COPD, diastolic heart failure, who was recently admitted for pneumonia, DM II, and aortic stenosis who presented with three days of cough.
Initially, the cough was productive of sputum (unknown color) but for the past 24 hours before admission, cough was dry.
She denied any fever, sore throat, body aches, sinus congestion or any change in her breathing.
On review, patient denied any chest pain or peripheral edema.
A chest xray was performed that revealed bronchiectasis in the upper lobe lesions, with no areas of consolidation.
Past Medical History: --COPD: Last spirometry [**6-14**]: Results are consistent with a restrictive ventilatory defect.
Cannot rule out obstructive gas trapping.
--Bronchiectasis: history of atypical mycobacteria on sputum culture in [**2191**]- followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21848**].
Concern of CP in association with elevated blood pressure in past.
--Aortic stenosis: ECHO in [**2195-4-10**]-The left atrium is mildly  dilated, left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Mild aortic stenosis is present.
Mild  (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the findings of  the prior study of [**2193-11-28**], there has been no significant change.
Physical Exam: (on transfer): VS: T 96.8, HR 57-77, BP 128-163/46, RR 18-29, O2sat: 92-97% on 3L nasal canula; I/O: 580/965, net:-385 GENERAL: Pleasant elderly Caucasian female who is quite anxious.
No cervical adenopathy.
Purple lesion in left inner cheek.
NECK: No JVP, no adenopathy, no thyromegaly.
LUNGS: Crackles prominent in right lung, throughout.
Coarse breath sounds.
Crackles at the bases.
HEART: Regular with 3/6 holosystolic murmur at apex.
Tender in right upper quadrant to deep palpation.
2+ peripheral pulses.
No pulmonary edema.
No consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2) Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-2-1**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased slightly and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are higher.
Chest Xray ([**2197-1-31**]): Allowing for differences in technique, there has been near complete resolution of bilateral upper lobe opacities from [**2196-12-7**].
Mild bronchiectasis in these regions remain.
There are no new areas of consolidation.
The pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no pneumothorax.
Reticulonodular opacities in bilateral lung apices, right middle and lower lobes are stable and correspond with recent Chest CT, consistent with chronic MAC.
A tiny right pleural effusion is slightly smaller than on prior exam.
No new consolidations are noted.
Multifocal reticulonodular opacities are stable, consistent with known chronic MAC.

1) Dyspnea: The patient presented with dyspnea and was ininitally in the MICU as she was tachypneic.
In addition to her infection the patient has known COPD and rhonchorous and wheezing on examination.
Her pressures continued to be elevated and she was given increased doses of nifedipine and hydral.
3) CHF: The patient had an EF between 60-70% on cardiac ECHO on [**2197-2-3**], with moderate AR and AS, with prolonged mitral deceleration time.
4) Decreased renal function:  The patient presented with a creatinine of 1.4, increased from her baseline of 0.9.
5) Leukocytosis:  The patient developed an increased white count during her stay and this was attributed to a combination of infectious process (+MRSA) and steroid initiation.
The patient had some abdominal discomfort during her course, mostly in right upper quadrant, though this remained stable and her LFT's were unremarkable.
7) Purple mouth sores:  During the physical exam the patient was noted to have small purple lesion on inner left cheek.
The diagnosis and duration of these lesions is unclear, though the patient may need a biopsy as an outpatient.
8. atypical chest pain: The patient developed some chest pain, that was reproducible on exam and seemed not to be acs.
Abdominal Pain:  The patient continually complained of abdominal pain, that seemed to be chronic.
She had slightly elevated lipase, so this may have been related to pancreatitis.
10) Diabetes Mellitus:  The patient has diet controlled diabetes.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
COPD 2.
MRSA pneumonia 3. bronchiectasis 4.
Hypertension 5.
Steroid induced diabetes (and baseline diet controlled diabetes) 6.
Anemia 7.
You were admitted for shortness of breath, and noted to have a respiratory infection.
You also were noted to have a copd exacerbation and were treated with steroids.
Please return for fevers, chills, chest pain, dizziness, vomiting, inability to take medications or any concerns.
