Post-op course was complicated by cardiogenic shock with IABP placement.
Also had thoracentesis on [**7-14**] (on left, removed 150cc).
She was discharged on [**2200-7-19**] and returned a few days later to [**Hospital 90668**]Hospital with chest pain and dyspnea felt to be possible Dressler's.
She was also diagnosed with a staph aureus pneumonia and given moxi and vancomcyin.
She also had upper airway stridor with coarse hoarseness; CT chest revealed 5mm tracheal opening c/w stenosis with potential tracheal fracture.

TTE [**8-4**]: MPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid LAD distribution).
Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
CTA chest [**8-2**]: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary embolus.
Nodal mass at the level of the right bronchus intermedius extending to the level of the takeoff of the superior segment of the left lower lobe bronchus.
Recommend short interval followup with CT. Soft tissue thickening at the posterior wall of the carina and right mainstem bronchus with mild right mainstem luminal narrowing which can be evaluated further on followup for the nodal mass described above.
Tracheal stenosis cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: This is a 39 year old female with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2200-7-8**] c/b cardiogenic shock with IABP, EF 30%, possible Dressler's syndrome, pneumonia, and tracheal stenosis who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of tracheal stenosis.
Bronchoscopy revealed mucoid concretions obstructing 95% of the tracheal lumen.
ACTIVE ISSUES .
Tissue biopsy and bronchial washings were sent which revealed commensal bacterial flora as well as diphtheroids and enterococcus.
She was covered empirically with vancomycin, clindamycin, and aztreonam, as well as micafungin for possible fungal infection and Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis given her course of steroids.
Post-bronch, her breathing was unlabored with no evidence of inspiratory stridor or hypoxia.
CT also demonstrated nodal mass believed to be related to her infection.
Chest pain: Has ongoing pleuritic stabbing chest pain at site of recent surgery.
There was concern for Dressler's and she was started on steroids at an OSH.
But the time course seemed too short for Dressler's (usually presents weeks after MI, though some present within a week) and ECG was without evidence of pericarditis.
Repeat ECHO showed no evidence of effusion.
Reproducibility of pain on palpation most likely indicated a post-sternotomy chest wall etiology.
This pain was thought unlikely to be ACS given her description, negative trop x 2, and no evidence of acute ischemic changes on EKG.
Patient was switched to prednisone and then weaned off given low concern for pericarditis and evidence of tracheal infection.
Her pain was controlled with PO oxycontin and dilaudid.
This was most likely a result of both infection and glucocorticoid administration.
Her prednisone was weaned off and she was covered broadly for infection as described above.
Hypotension: Mild hypotension with SBP in the 80's-100's throughout her admission.
This was thought most likely to be related to mild systolic dysfunction without compensatory tachycardia (on a beta blocker).
It was felt unlikely to be secondary to disseminated infection or sepsis given that she was broadly covered and consistently afebrile even off prednisone.
CAD s/p CABG: She had 5 vessel CABG less than one month ago.
EKG consistent with recent anterior MI.
She was monitored on telemetry which revealed no abnormalities.
Acute systolic CHF: Had acute systolic CHF (EF of 20%) from MI at OSH.
Repeat ECHO at [**Hospital1 18**] showed normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction, right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation, increased PCWP, and pulmonary artery hypertension.
Clinically she did not show overt evidence of CHF or volume overload, though she does note mild shortness of breath when lying flat.
Glucose was elevated during admission.
H/o Crohn's: No symptoms during admission.
# CAD/systolic HF: She has a f/u appt.
# Thoracic nodal masses, likely infectious: IP will schedule f/u re.

As you know you were transferred to here because there was a concern that you had an infection in your windpipe.
The pulmonologist took a look at your throat with a special scope and felt there was likely a bacterial infection there.
