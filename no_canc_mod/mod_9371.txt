[**8-31**] CXR IMPRESSION: Subtle patchy opacities likely represent PCP pneumonia in this HIV+ patient.
Other causes of pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Prominence of the hila likely represents pulmonary vascular congestion or lymphadenopathy  [**8-31**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis-IMPRESSION: Patchy opacities, basiliar consolidation and apical bullae.
Other causes of infectious pneumonia cannot be excluded.
[**9-4**] Brain MRI IMPRESSION: Diffuse dural and tentorial enhancement without associated leptomeningeal enhancement.
[**9-4**] CXR Pa/lat: IMPRESSION: Near-complete resolution of bilateral infiltrates.
Tiny pleural effusion.
1)PNA/meningitis-   ID consulted on the case and felt that he should be treated for both pneumonia and meningitis.
Gram stain of sputum was positive for GPC in pairs, and it was felt that patient likley had S.pneumo (although cultures were negative).
MRI was c/w meningitis, but it could not be discerned whether this was viral or bacterial.
Repeat LP before pt transferred to floor showed few white cells and monocyte predominant.
2)HIV-pt was w/o evidence of opportunistic infection while on floor.
3)Hilar LAD- finding on chest CT.  should be followed as outpt in [**5-20**] weeks pending radiographic resolution of PNA   -f/u as outpt w/repeat CT.(however note below)  ***post hospital course c/b discovery of AFB positive sputum culture, as per attg note PMD contact[**Name (NI) **] who was to contact pt.
possibly initially low secondary to sepsis/sirs vs hit ab.
