# Altered mental status: Etiology for acute change is most likely seizure (based on EEG evidence of seizure like spikes).
Initially we were concerned for infective etiologies and treated with broad spectrum antibiotics which were discontinued when cutures came back negative (UCx negative; BCx NGTD).
# Hypovolemic hyponatremia: This remained stable.
If still hyponatremic and hypovolemic would correct volume with gentle normal saline boluses.
# HTN continued home regimen  # Elevated troponin (stable), normal CK, no ECG change, patient asymptomatic: Very unlikely  ACS and no treatment was indiated.
