As noted previously, the right mediastinal contour appearance is most likely due to tortuous vessels, which may be accentuated by the lordotic projection.
The lungs appear grossly clear, and there are no pleural effusions.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2173-10-11**], there is no definite change.
3-cm fluid collection with peripheral enhancement containing air and fluid in the left perirectal area, likely representing perirectal abscess in this patient with purulent drainage from rectum.
Air-containing tubular structure extending from the abscess inferiorly,  may represent fistula to the skin; however, the most inferior portion of the lesion is not included in the present study.
Decrease in size of bilateral inguinal fluid collections, larger on the right, probably representing seroma versus hematoma as described previously.
Small collection of air in the bladder, which may be related to recent catheter placement if there is an appropriate history; however, please correlate with the result of urinalysis.

Coli bacteremia/UTI, peri-rectal abscess/enterococcal wound infection.
Hypotension: The patient was initially admitted to the general surgery services for drainage of her perirectal abscess, which was initially delayed secondary to a supratherapeutic INR requiring FFP for reversal.
Given the patient's positive blood cultures and perirectal abscess, the most likely source is E. coli bacteremia, which was ultimately found to be resistant to quinolones.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative for any new ischemia contributing to the hypotension.
A TTE was performed that demonstrated LVEF of 60% and minimal AV stenosis.
Patient had a [**Last Name (un) 104**] stym test that showed no adrenal insufficiency.
Currently, the patient is receiving Aztreonam, Linezolid, and metronidazole, Day 3 for these antibiotics.
The patient has not required fluid boluses or pressors but may receive fluid as needed if she develops any hypotension.
The patient has chronic appearing necrotic ulcer over heel.
In the setting of infection and alteration of coumadin dosing.
PAF - patient remained in sinus rhythym.
As outlined above, patient will restart coumadin therapy on discharge, but will require close monitoring in the setting of previously elevated INR and ongoing abx dosing.
Likely secondary to peri-op blood loss.
Peri-rectal abcess: Surgery packed wound and followed throughout hospital course.
Sertraline 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): Please Hold sertraline while patient is receiving Linezolid, as it may increase chance of dangerous side effects.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Peri-rectal abcess E. Coli Bacteremia UTI, bacterial and fungal COPD CHF PVD   Discharge Condition: Patient is hemodynamically stable, afebrile, not yet OOB, taking POs.
Discharge Instructions: You will need your abcess wound packed with wet to dry dressings twice a day at skilled care facility.
You are at a lower dose of your Lisinopril and this dose can be increased as an outpatient.
