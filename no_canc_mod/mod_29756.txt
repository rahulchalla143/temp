Admission Date:  [**2176-11-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2176-11-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2117-9-30**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old man who was transferred to the CMI Service on the [**7-21**] for a cardiac catheterization after suffering a non Q wave myocardial infarction at [**Hospital6 33**].
He has a long history of coronary artery disease, status post multiple interventions and multiple myocardial infarctions.
In [**2176-8-19**], he was admitted to an outside hospital for 12 hours of chest pain and ruled in for an myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 1800.
He has been asymptomatic since that time until three weeks prior to admission when he developed exertional angina that progressed to unstable angina over two to three days.
His primary care physician ordered an exercise treadmill test and an echocardiogram on the [**9-13**] which showed a fixed apical defect and a mid anterior defect with an ejection fraction of 47%.
While driving on [**11-19**], he noted chest pain and had incomplete relief with three sublingual nitroglycerin.
He was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] and ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a CPK of 457.
He has been pain free for the past 24 hours and was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for catheterization on [**2176-11-20**].
Catheterization showed severe three vessel disease and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 38%.
Coronary artery disease, status post multiple catheterizations, status post stent times one, status post multiple myocardial infarctions.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary disease and diabetes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a groggy intermittently arousable man in no acute distress with a blood pressure of 101/62 and a pulse of 73.
His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam is unremarkable and he has no jugular venous distention.
His heart is regular with distant heart sounds but no murmurs.
His extremities are without edema and with 2+ distal pulses.
He had diffusely flattened T wave but no acute ST changes.
Catheterization results revealed diffuse severe three vessel coronary disease with mild systolic and diastolic dysfunction and an ejection fraction of 38%.
He has moderate mitral regurgitation.
He had anterolateral, apical and inferior basal akinesis with preserved inferior and anterior basal wall motion.
He underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of his mid left anterior descending and his distal left anterior descending.
He had moderate Instent restenosis of a right posterior descending artery stent that was unchanged from his previous catheterization in [**2174**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was observed in the Coronary Care Unit overnight given the multiple nature of his interventions and his diffuse coronary disease.
A beta-blocker could not be started due to his adverse reaction to them.
He developed a cough on the Captopril and so it was changed to Diovan.
After catheterization, he suffered some nausea and bloating that was without electrocardiogram changes and resolved after he had a bowel movement.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had two episodes of [**11-28**] chest pain, each lasting five minutes which resolved without intervention two nights after his catheterization.
Given this, he was started on Isordil with no further ischemic pain.
On exam the day after his catheterization, he was noted to have bibasilar rales.
On his third hospital day when he began to ambulate, he also noted some dyspnea on exertion.
It was unclear whether this was due to diuresis or preload reduction with Isordil.
He was advised to use Lasix as needed for dyspnea on exertion and to avoid it on a regular basis or if he became lightheaded.
He was also changed to Imdur and advised to stop using it if he began to have lightheadedness.
Status post non Q wave myocardial infarction.
History of coronary artery disease with history of multiple myocardial infarctions and multiple stent placements.
