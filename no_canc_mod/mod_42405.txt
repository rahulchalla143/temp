Admission Date:  [**2133-3-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2105-1-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2061-5-19**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Medicine, [**Hospital1 **] Firm  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old female with a history of diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, morbid obesity, and chronic low back pain who was admitted with one week of progressive dyspnea on exertion, a 4-pound weight gain, and increasing lower extremity edema.
The patient is also complaining of mild chest pressure on the day of admission, lasting approximately 5 minutes to 10 minutes, intermittent, relieved on its own, without associated increase in her baseline dyspnea, without radiation, without diaphoresis, and without nausea or vomiting.
The patient denies any fevers or chills.
She denies any abdominal pain, and denies any dysuria.
She states she has a chronic nonproductive cough times years that has increased in frequency over the past week.
The patient denies any sputum production.
The patient reports dyspnea with minimal activity; such as eating, dressing, etcetera.
The patient reports a decreased appetite, but no increase in her sodium intake.
The patient reports paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea increased from her baseline.
Diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Obstructive sleep apnea (on home [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure).
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine of 1.8 to 2.2).
Chronic low back pain.
Morbid obesity.
Guaiac-positive stools with a negative colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was positive for signs of congestive heart failure.
An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation, poor R wave progression, and normal axis.
There were no ST-T wave changes, but there was T wave flattening in leads I and aVL (which is old).
An echocardiogram in [**2133-1-19**] showed left atrial enlargement, an ejection fraction of 55%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild right ventricular dilation, mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension.
DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION VERSUS RIGHT HEART FAILURE ISSUES: The patient was noted to be volume overloaded throughout her hospital stay.
Initially, the patient was tried on intravenous Lasix at varying doses with the assistance of afterload reduction, and angiotensin receptor blocker, and heart rate control, and a beta blocker.
The patient showed minimal diuresis to the intravenous Lasix regimen of 60 mg twice per day.
This was then changed to a Bumex regimen of one twice per day, also with minimal diuresis.
The patient had some elevation of her creatinine during this time, and this limited further diuresis.
The patient was started on Lasix 80 mg intravenously three times per day which provided good diuresis of approximately 2 liters; however, this resulted in hypotension and mental status changes.
In addition, due to the mental status changes, the patient became hypercapnic and had increasing insomnia and agitation.
On multiple repeat chest x-rays the patient showed increasing pulmonary congestion.
It was unclear whether this was related to her hypoxic and hypercarbic state versus right-sided and left-sided heart failure.
There was limited improvement in the patient's lower extremity edema throughout her hospitalization.
They remainder of her heart failure course will be included by the covering intern.
OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA/RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE/OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient's body habitus caused multiple problems in her pulmonary function; including bicarbonate retention, likely from her body habitus causing some restrictive disease.
In addition, at some point, the Interventional Pulmonology Service will be consulted regarding an ultrasound of the chest for possible drainage of any total effusions.
The patient's respiratory status had greatly complicated her diuresis as well as causing significant mental status variations.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient was rate controlled on a beta blocker (metoprolol).
The patient was anticoagulated for both her atrial fibrillation as well as her likely hypercoagulable state secondary to her obesity issues.
The patient's target partial thromboplastin time was in the lower therapeutic range given her history of guaiac-positive stools.
The patient have guaiac-positive stools during her hospitalization; however, she was never hemodynamically unstable, and her hematocrit remained near her baseline throughout.
HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  On her last hospitalization, the patient was noted to have a very low thyroid-stimulating hormone and elevated free T4.
It was felt that the patient's hypothyroid state was likely secondary to an amnio-induced thyrotoxicosis.
It was felt the patient's endocrine abnormalities may have been contributing to her overall poor functional status, and to maximize this would improve not only diuresis but the patient's symptoms as well.
CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.2 to 1.9.
This was likely secondary to her long-time hypertension resulting in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
Following her brief stay in the Coronary Care Unit, the patient likely developed acute tubular necrosis secondary to hypotension.
The goal of diuresis was approximately one kilogram per day, which the patient began to achieve with Lasix 40 mg intravenously twice per day.
STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient developed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia while in the Coronary Care Unit; likely from peripheral line placement.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  Given the patient is Jehovah Witness and does not accept blood products, close monitoring of her hematocrit was done.
Despite having guaiac-positive stools, the patient was never hemodynamically unstable and never had a significant hematocrit drop.
Due to her religious beliefs, the patient's heparin drip was run at a slightly lower than therapeutic level by partial thromboplastin time for concern of bleeding and catastrophic consequences of such an event.
