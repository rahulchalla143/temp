MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI: IMPRESSION: Signal abnormalities at both posterior frontal and parietal convexity region on FLAIR and T2-weighted images without corresponding enhancement or diffusion abnormalities.
These findings could be secondary to previous infarcts.
No enhancing lesions are seen.
Small areas of microhemorrhages are seen in both cerebral hemispheres near the convexity indicating old hemorrhages.
No enhancing lesions are seen.
Extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
An MRCP would be helpful in order to assess for any obstructive process.
Marked wall thickening of the gallbladder with intramural edema.
This can be seen in several clinical scenarios, including cholecystitis but other features of cholecystitis are not present such as stones and distention.
The appearance can be seen in acute hepatic disease and hypoalbuminemia as well.
Possible edema around the head of the pancreas.
Correlation with pancreatitic enzymes to exclude coincident pancreatitis is recommended.
This may be due to medications.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness into drowsiness but no stage II sleep was seen.
No focal or epileptiform features were observed.
ECHO [**2-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Underdistended gallbladder with no apparent stones.
If clinical concern exists for chronic cholecystitis, a HIDA scan would be the study of choice.
Prominent extrahepatic bile duct tapers normally and demonstrates no evidence of choledocholithiasis.
Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions.
The previously identified congestive heart failure has been improving.
There is continued cardiomegaly and small right pleural effusion associated with bilateral lower lobe patchy atelectasis.
Note is made of a question of nodular opacity in the right apex, which can be composite shadow.
When patient is better, evaluate with repeated PA, bilateral shallow oblique radiographs of the chest.
Improving congestive heart failure with remaining cardiomegaly and small right pleural effusion.
Question of nodular opacity in the right apex.
No evidence of hematoma within the right upper neck.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2136-3-2**]: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, this is a 50 year old man with history of hypertension, depression, chronic pain and osteomyelitis who presented with likely cardiac arrest secondary to opioid overdose and possible associated seizure.
On admission to the emergency department, patient was only briefly hypotensive with systolic in 70's which responded to IV fluid resuscitation and required transient peripheral levophed.
A LP was performed to rule out meningitis in setting of witnessed seizure.
Also, of note, patient was in severe lactic acidosis with pH <7.0 which responded to stat administration of 3 amps of sodium bicarbonate.
In the MICU, patient subsequently developed elevated LFTs, rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure.
Initially, patient had a severe anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis.
Metabolic acidosis was likely secondary to lactic acidosis in setting of cardiac arrest decreased organ perfusion and possible seizure.
Etiology of non-gap acidosis was unclear.
Patient's mental status and respiratory acidosis improved and he was extubated on [**2-26**] after a RSBI ~10.
Repeat CXR was improved but continued to show pulmonary edema.
?Seizure: Patient was initially worked up for seizure with a differential diagnosis of opiate overdose, vasovagal induced, infection induced or EtOH withdrawal induced.
MRI/MRA/MRV were negative for emboli or other abnormalities.
LP was performed and not consistent with meningitis.
Unclear whether patient actually seized or had post cardiac arrest movements however if patient did seize the likely etiology was either alcohol withdrawal or opiate overdose induced metabolic derangement.
Patient's mental status returned to baseline and no recurrence of seizures occurred while in hospital.
EEG was negative for seizure.
Nonspecific vascular findings on MRI, per neurology were old and would not have contributed to current presentation.
Rhabdomyolysis: Etiology likely secondary to immobilization and ischemic compression of muscle induced by opioid overdose versus drug induced seizures or hyperthermia associated with excess muscle energy demands.
Also, metabolic derangement including hypokalemia (2.8 on admission) and hypocalcemia (5.9) may have contributed or caused the rhabdo but unclear etiology of electrolyte abnormalities ?opioid overdose.
Calcium was repleted aggressively while alkalinizing his urine to prevent further renal damage.
Etiology of acute renal failure likely secondary to hypovolemia during cardiac arrest and rhabdomyolysis.
There was an unsuccessful RIJ line placement on [**2-29**], no hematoma was seen on neck US.
At time of discharge, patient had gone for 5 days without dialysis and was making large volumes of urine.
Chronic pain/R LE pain: Patient with history of right ankle injury requiring multiple surgeries between [**2126**]-[**2130**].
It was recommended in [**2130**] that he have his R ankle amputated however patient decided not to have the amputation and to medically treat his chronic pain.
Pain medications were held until patient's mental status was at baseline and then he was started and gradually titrated up on a fentanyl patch with oxycodone PRN for breakthrough.
IV diladudid was used as breakthrough which was subsequently switched to PO dilaudid and then discontinued due to adequate pain control.
Please obtain pain management consult for pain control if pain is unable to be controlled with fentanyl patch with oxycodone.
Review of US with radiology showed distal location of possible clot and low risk for embolization and so no further anti-coagulation was planned.
Initially, RUQ US suggestive for cholecystitis however subsequent abdominal MRI showed prominent extrahepatic bile duct tapers normally and demonstrates no evidence of choledocholithiasis.
Alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin began to downtrend without intervention and so no HIDA/MRCP was pursued.
Near resolution of elevated LFTs at time of discharge.
ID: Patient with very high temp in ED.
Differential diagnosis included seizure versus infectious etiology.
Patient was only briefly hypotensive and on transient levophed.
LP negative for organisms and not consistent with meningitis.
On [**2-26**], antibiotics were discontinued given low suspicion for infection.
Abnormal chest x-ray findings: Patient will need to follow-up with chest x-ray with PA/LAT/bilateral shallow oblique views to re-evaluated possible nodular opacity in right apex of lung seen on chest x-ray [**2136-2-28**].
Patient has a remote history of pulmonary nodules of unclear etiology.
FEN: Patient is no longer requiring dialysis, watch for electrolyte abnormalities .
Peripheral IVs .
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5-1 Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for breakthrough pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 69**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: opiate overdose alchohol abuse/dependence cardiac arrest rhabdomyolysis acute renal failure depression NOS .
Secondary diagnosis: chronic right ankle pain history of osteomyelitis hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Please take medications as prescribed.
Please get repeat chest x-ray (PA/LAT/bilateral shallow oblique views) to re-evaluated possible nodular opacity in right apex of lung seen on chest x-ray [**2136-2-28**].
If pain is not well controlled on the fentanyl patch with oxycodone, obtain pain management consult.
Obtain renal consult for follow up of acute renal failure.
Please have your blood work checked for recovery of your renal function.
