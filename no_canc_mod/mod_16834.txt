Admission Date:  [**2188-5-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-6-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2166-7-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: [**Doctor First Name 147**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1**] Chief Complaint: Pt presents on [**2188-5-19**] for one-stage Ileopouch-anal anastomosis.
Primary Incision CLosure   History of Present Illness: Pt has an established history of ulcerative colitis.
Father died of colon CA at 43yo.
On [**5-25**], pt began having copious bilious vomiting as well as copious bowel movements.
Later that evening he became hypotensive and severely tachycardic, with declining mental status.
Pt transferred to SICU, intubated, and taken to OR for exploratory laparotomy and diverting ileostomy; primary incision left open due to abdominal compartment syndrome.
Pt continued to be hypotensive requiring pressure support for several days, with significant accompanying electrolyte abnormalities.
On floor, pt had an erratic course with fluctuations in fluid status and severe fluctuations in heart rate.
In consultation with renal and endocrine services, electrolyte and fluid status issues were resolved, and patient discharged home with midline venous catheter for prn fluid support, and appropriate VNA services.
In greater depth, consider hospital course by system:  Neuro: Pt admitted in excellent neuro condition, continued until [**5-25**] during suspected hypoadrenal crisis when pt experienced significant decline in mental status.
When these drips were stopped, pt recovered normal mental status and was noted to have no neurologic deficits throughout the rest of his hospital course.
Cardiovascular: Unremarkable until [**5-25**], when as noted pt became hypotensive to 80s/40s and tachycardic to 180s.
Upon transfer to floor on [**6-5**], pt continued to have erratic HR.
As patient's fluid status gradually stabilized, his HR also stabilized, with modest changes in HR most likely due to deconditioning after a [**Hospital 47424**] hospital stay.
Endocrine: A hypoadrenal crisis is believed to be the central insult giving rise to pt's rapid decompensation and subsequent arduous course.
On night of [**5-25**] was administered stress dose steroids in response to tachycardia unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.
In SICU pt noted to have bizarre electrolyte abnormalities, including sodiums up to 160, with concomitant concentrated urine.
Electrolytes stabilized in SICU, and upon transfer to floor pt remained eunatremic despite significant fluid shifts and fluctuating urine osmolarity.
Pt tried on Florinef to assist mineralocorticoid function, but this was of minimal help.
Renal: Initially no renal issues were suspected.
Also considered was a diagnosis of solute diuresis, powered by excess urea creation from steroid therapy and increased protein intake.
Renal team decided that, under stress of past month, pt had simply washed out his interstitial gradient and in the presence of polydipsia would be unable to appropriately concentrate urine.
He subsequently developed oral thrush and Fluconazole was added to his regimen.
He had a complex diuresis with confusing urine osmolarities, further complicated by concomitant administration of pitressor.
Due to abdominal compartment syndrome of 6.27, pt was given diverting ileostomy and open abdomen to assist recovery.
[**Name (NI) 47425**] pt was found to be in a profound ileus with copious dark fluid in the small intestine, though the anastomosis remained quite secure.
Loperamide HCl 2 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for diarrhea  for 30 days.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for chest pain.
Disp:*15 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Last Name (LF) 486**], [**First Name3 (LF) 487**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Ulcerative Colitis Dehydration Hypoadrenal crisis Renal Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, Polyuria  Discharge Condition: Good.
Please try to drink plenty of fluids, as you are at increased risk for dehydration.
Follow instructions on care for your Mid line, your osotmy, and your wound care.
