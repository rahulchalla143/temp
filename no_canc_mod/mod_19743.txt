HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 69-year-old female with diabetes diet controlled, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with unknown CAD presents to [**Hospital3 3834**] after one week of progressive dyspnea on exertion.
Per patient's symptoms started approximately two months ago with progressive shortness of breath and inability to exercise as she previously tolerated.
Of note, the patient recently had DDD [**Company 1543**] pacemaker placed on [**2146-11-4**] for sick sinus syndrome and A-V block.
At [**Hospital3 3834**], the patient was found to be hypotensive, anemic with a hematocrit of 24, and in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 4.1, coagulopathic, INR 4.5.
Course was complicated by hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 70s, given 200 cc/hour IV fluids, and dobutamine 2 mg/kg/minute.
Echocardiogram obtained showed a 1-3 cm circumferential pericardial effusion with early tamponade, question for left atrial collapse, no pulsus paradoxus noted.
Systolic blood pressure in the 70s with lightheadedness, neck and jaw pain.
Patient on call to the Catheter Laboratory for assessment for presumed cardiac tamponade.
Diabetes adult onset.
Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
Complete heart block with sick sinus syndrome.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  Mild respiratory distress, unable to speak in full sentences.
Elevated jugular venous pressure to TMJ, no thyromegaly.
Pulmonary:  Anterolateral clear to auscultation with decreased breath sounds at left base.
Abdomen is mildly distended, obese nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly, no pulsatile liver.
Extremities:  2+ bilateral pitting edema to mid calf, +2 femoral pulses, no bruits.
EKG:  Atrial fibrillation, paced, no ischemic ST changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation recently placed pacemaker, subacute pericardial effusion of unclear etiology likely hemorrhagic, workup viral, malignant physiology.
Pericardial centesis performed removal of 1,050 cc of hemorrhagic pericardial fluid.
Echocardiogram showed minimal residual fluid.
Filling pressures remained elevated with wide respiratory variation with RA pressure 35, PA 60/30, and PCW 35.
Improvement in cardiac output and resolution of paradoxical pulse.
Patient is currently chest pain free and sent back to CCU for recovery.
Repeat echocardiogram showed minimal change and small amount of pericardial effusion, no tamponade physiology.
The patient continued to be chest pain free.
Patient remained normotensive off pressors and began diuresing.
Elevated PA diastolic pressures of 22 post procedure suggest volume overload in the setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation during periods of hypertension.
Viral cultures pending.
CBC consistent with hemorrhagic fluid.
Interrogation read no abnormal impedance.
Patient remained off aspirin and anticoagulation in the setting of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
Patient continued to be chest pain free.
Was transferred to the floor, where she underwent Physical Therapy with continual shortness of breath.
Renal function:  On arrival, patient likely prerenal secondary to poor cardiac output due to tamponade physiology.
ID:  Viral bacterial serologies were sent for pericardial analysis.
Pulmonary:  Stable PCWP 30 at time of catheterization, likely volume overload in the setting of aggressive fluid rehydration.
Chest x-ray negative for pneumothorax post procedure.
FEN and GI:  Hyponatremia:  Patient likely sodium wasting secondary to from ATN from hypotensive episode.
Heme:  Coagulation reversed in setting of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion with 4 units of FFP, 5 mg IV of vitamin K.  Hold on anticoagulation for at least one month.
Patient given number for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for possible future followup.
