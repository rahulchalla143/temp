He did no lose consciousness, but was in a significant amount of pain.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On neurological examination on admission the patient was awake, but preferred to keep his eyes closed secondary to what appeared to be mild photophobia and headache.
LABORATORY:  Head CT from the outside hospital demonstrated extensive pneumocephalus bifrontally with the appearance of tension, extensive intracranial subarachnoid air opacification or sphenoid posterior and ethmoid sinuses.
This whole picture was consistent with the patient having a basilar skull fracture of the sphenoid and posterior ethmoid sinuses likely causing a mucosal ball valve phenomenon leading to this extensive pneumocephalus.
The patient had an initial INR level of 4.6 as he is on Coumadin for his heart valve replacement.
In the meantime the patient's INR was reversed with fresh frozen platelets and with vitamin K.  The patient was initially started on antimicrobial coverage for the possibility of having a meningitis as a result of this skull fracture.
He could have some degree of neck stiffness, however, a lumbar puncture could not be performed, because the patient's INR was so high.
Once the patient's INR was appropriately corrected with fresh frozen platelets the patient was taken by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of otolaryngology to the Operating Room with a pre and postoperative diagnosis of right sphenoid sinus fracture with pneumocephalus.
The patient had serial head CTs as well as serial lateral skull x-rays that showed excellent improvement in his amount of pneumocephalus over time.
The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of ear, nose and throat in one month and the patient must follow up with his primary care physician [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6739**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**1-3**] for an INR check and their office will adjust his Coumadin accordingly.
