EKG: NSR, Nl axis and intervals; RBBB, TWI in V2 CXR [**2186-1-12**] FINDINGS: There are bibasilar opacities and pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Although these opacities appear to include atelectatic changes, underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
There is diffuse hyperinflation suggestive of emphysema.
The cortical contour of the left proximal humerus is irregular but incompletely visualized due to overlying external hardware.
Bibasilar opacities and pleural effusions; pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 75yoF with h/o RA, Zenker's diverticulum, diverticulitis s/p colostomy, breast ca s/p mastectomy presents with 6-day history of cough, pleuritic CP, chills, SOB, and low-grade fever .
# Bronchitis: On presentation was 95-97% on RA.
CXR showed questionable bibasilar infiltrate with R > L pleural effusions.
Urinary legionella was negative, sputum culture grew yeast which is a contaminant.
On reconsideration, cough and dyspnea are better explained by bronchitis than pneumonia given absence of radiographic or physical examination findings consistent with pneumonia.
Hypotension is related to reduced PO intake and loose stools and transient sepsis related to urinary tract infection.
Amoldipine was held on admission and was not resumed on discharge as patient remained normotensive.
# Urinary tract infection: UA performed after admission was leukocyte esterase positive with many white blood cells and bacteria.
Though epithelial cells were isolated in the UA suggesting that the speimenm was not a clean catch, the high number of whites and bacteria suggested that there may have been a true urinary tract infection.
She denied dysuria however she is not a reliable historian.
She had been started on levofloxacin as above and this was continued for a total of 5 days of treatment for urinary tract infection.
