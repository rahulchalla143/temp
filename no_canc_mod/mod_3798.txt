There is a small left-sided pleural effusion.
Left basilar atelectasis is slightly worse when compared to the previous study.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated with a maximum diameter of 3.9- 4.1.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2) Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild 1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No significant AI noted, no perivalvular leaks.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and weaned from pressor support without difficulty.
While on the SDU, he experienced bouts of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which was treated initially with Amiodarone and advancement in beta blockade.
Continued to have AFIB episodes and Heparin with transition to Coumadin was eventually started.
On post-op day twelve vascular surgery were consulted for his arm thrombophlebitis and they performed a bed-side wound debridement.
He continued to have Atrial Fibrillation which was difficult to control his rate and on post-op day seventeen a pacemaker was inserted.
