Admission Date:  [**2166-8-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-9-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-10-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lisinopril / Toprol Xl / Lipitor / Levofloxacin / Compazine / Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**] Chief Complaint: Change in mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation and extubation central venous catheter placement  History of Present Illness: 55 yo F with h/o CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM2, PVD, CRI with h/o episodes of ARF, h/o hyperkalemia BIBA due to lethary.
Patient was feeling generally unwell since discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for episode of ARF with Cr was 2.3 (from baseline 1.1) and K 6.8 and LE pain [**12-26**] PVD.
Given 0.4 narcan with no response.
K hemolyzed but elevated to 7.8 given insulin/dextrose, calicum and kayexalate with improvement to 5.6.
CAD s/p CABG in [**2160**] at [**Hospital1 112**] 3.
DM 2 4. h/o CVA - c/b residual numbness/weakness of left arm and leg 5.
HTN 6.
Hyperlipidemia 7.
Elevated LFTs, unknown etiology (?NASH)   Social History: She works for the Department of Mental Retardation.
She denies a history of alcohol/drug use.
[**2166-8-19**] CT head: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
No acute fractures are identified.
TTE [**2166-8-22**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the basal segments of the inferior and posterior walls.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2159-9-25**], moderate aortic stenosis is now present.
Limited views of the liver show no focal lesions.
Evaluation of the main portal vein with Doppler shows hepatopetal flow, appropriately, but there are periods of intermittent neutral flow which could reflect portal hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a 52 year old woman with history of CAD s/p CABG, diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, chronic kidney disease (type 4 RTA), and PVD who presented with subacute change in mental status.
# Decreased Mental Status: The patient presented with decreased consciousness following a low impact fall at home.
An initial head CT was negative for mass effect or bleeds.
The etiology of her change in mental status was likely multifactorial secondary to obesity hypoventilation leading to hypercapnea and hypoxia, severe sleep deprivation from OSA, worsening renal failure, +/- small contribution from hyperammonenia.
Other diagnostic possibilities that were negative included screen for drug intoxication, sepsis, thyroid dysfunction, or seizure.
The patient was evaluated by the neurology service who thought the change was likely a toxic-metabolic picture.
The endocrinology service was consulted and ruled out thyroid disfunction.
The patient was found to have a mildly elevated ammonia level, but the remainder of her synthetic liver function was normal.
The patient will need to have a sleep study as an outpatient to confirm the diagnosis of sleep apnea and to titrate CPAP.
In patient attempts at CPAP were unsuccessful due to claustraphobia once the patient was more awake.
# Resp: The patients initial hypercapnea was thought secondary to COPD and hypoventilation.
She was weaned and extubated without complication.
# Acute on Chronic RF.
The patient's underlying chronic kidney disease is likely [**12-26**] HTN/DM, type 4 RTA on last admission, with concomitant UTI (found on presentation).
The acute worsening of her renal function was somewhat unclear as the time course was quite rapid of a decline, however, no triggering toxic exposure was identified.
# HD catheter line infection: Patient noted to have purulent discharge from her hemodialysis catheter site during hemodialysis.
She was continued on 7 days daptomycin for empiric treatment.
Suspect early diagnosis to explain negative cultures versus sterile seroma but opted to treat to protect new line placed on the left.
Continue bacitracin cream to the incision site, which will need removal of stitches in the next couple of days.
# Hypotn/hypoxia on HD: Patient had an episode of transient hypotension and hypoxia while on hemodialysis on the day of the diagnosis of a suspected line infection.
Her blood pressure improved with a 200 cc bolus and her hypoxia resolved spontaneously.
Suspect transient bacteremia versus vancomycin allergic reaction (onset after 25 of 200 cc of vancomycin) versus overdialyzed.
No recurrent episodes.
# CAD s/p CABG.
There were no acute issues during her ICU stay as the patient denied CP and the EKG was non specific.
The TnT was slightly elevated at 0.02, which was likely [**12-26**] renal dysfunction.
TTE with new AS and CHF on exam (pitting edema, unable to assess JVD d/t body habitus).
She was started on a low dose ACEI on the floor given low EF and ESRD on hemodialysis (discussed with renal prior to initiation).
# Anemia: Patient has a baseline anemia with labs suggestive of iron deficiency.
Her admission was complicated with bleeding associated with a hemodialysis line placement.
# PPx.
# FEN: DM, cardiac diet .
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
