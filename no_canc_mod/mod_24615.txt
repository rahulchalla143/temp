Left eye conjunctival edema improved, abulic   Pertinent Results: [**Numeric Identifier 75057**] VERT/CAROTID A-GRAM Study Date of [**2186-11-8**] 2:40 PM/[**Numeric Identifier 83116**] CAROTID/CEREBRAL UNILAT Study Date of [**2186-11-8**] 2:40 PM IMPRESSION: [**Known firstname 2431**] [**Known lastname 89359**] underwent cerebral angiography after clipping of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
No branch vessel occlusion was identified.
No large hemorrhage.
Linear hyperdensity at the left frontal gyri could be trace subarachnoid hemorrhage.
EEG Study Date of [**2186-11-11**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of severe focal slowing, attenuation of faster frequencies, and absent alpha rhythm over the left hemisphere.
These findings are indicative of severe focal dysfunction, likely structural in origin, in the left hemisphere.
In addition, moderate diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm are indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is etiologically non-specific.
No electrographic seizures are present.
Lungs are low in volume but clear.
No pneumonia, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
EEG Study Date of [**2186-11-12**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of severe focal slowing, attenuation of faster frequencies, and absent alpha rhythm over the left hemisphere.
These findings are indicative of severe focal dysfunction, likely structural in origin, in the left hemisphere.
In addition, moderate diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm are indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is etiologically non-specific.
No electrographic seizures are present.
Compared to the prior day's study, there is no significant change.
Retrocardiac opacification appears similar compared to prior and may represent persistent atelectasis.
There is no new focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusions.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2186-11-16**] 1:24 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-13**], the Dobbhoff tube has been pulled back slightly so that there is now only minimal upward curve of the distal tip.
Continued low lung volumes with mild retrocardiac opacification consistent with some atelectatic changes.
No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or acute pneumonia.
No change in appearance of heart or lungs compared with study seven hours prior.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2186-11-17**] 8:24 AM PENDING READ****************  cultures: [**11-9**] Urine culture-Negative Blood culture-Negative  [**11-11**] Urine culture-Negative Blood Culture-Negative  [**11-13**]: Urine culture-Negative Blood culture-PENDING********************  [**11-15**]: Urine culture-negative Blood culture- PENDING*******************  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 53 year old patient who electively presented and underwent craniotomy and clipping without complication.
A Head CT was performed revealing linear hyperdenisty at the left frontal gyri as well as a developing hypodenisty in the L frontal lobe which could be edema vs ischemia.
A CT of the head revealed a small caudate stroke on the left.
The EEG was consistent with severe focal dysfunction in the left hemisphere without seizures.
There was no significant change in the neurological exam.
On [**11-13**] The patient was pan cultured and started on Antibiotics both for a hospital aquired pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration and periorbital cellulitis.
A blood culture was sent which was *****  Under continuous EEG monitoring, the study showed no evidence of seizures.
ID was curbsided and decided that since still spiking fevers on clindamycin that antibitoics be broadened to vancomycin and unasyn.
Speech therapy evaluated the patient and recommended a diet of puree and nectar thick liquids.
Ophthalmology was consulted for evaluation of L eye edema.
7. butalbital-acetaminophen-caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: [**1-22**] Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for headache.
11. nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for oral plaque.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
?Please return to the office in [**7-30**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
