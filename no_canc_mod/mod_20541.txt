ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Alert and oriented, however, slightly uncomfortable.
Clear to auscultation bilaterally, regular rate and rhythm, no chest abrasions.

Right lower extremity shows neurovascularly intact, positive pain with any motion in the hip, no pain in his knee or ankle, left lower extremity neurovascularly intact, no pain in the knee, ankle or hip.
Back shows no tenderness to palpation of thoracic, lumbar or sacral spine or cervical spine.
Admission radiographic examination, AP pelvis shows a 3 cm diastasis of the pubic symphysis and a sacral fracture, fibular fracture in zone 2 crossing the foramina, pelvic computerized tomography scan further described the sacral fracture and the pelvic fractures, the diastasis of the pubic symphysis along with the inferior pubic rami fractures.
The patient's serial hematocrits showed a drop to 25.8.
The patient remained afebrile during that time.
He underwent pelvic external fixture placement and right sacroiliac screw placement.
The patient was noticed to have a questionable compression fracture in the thoracic vertebra, however, this was noted to be old fracture.
Neurosurgery was consulted, but also noted was a laminar fracture in the lumbar region which appeared to be nonoperative and without any stabilization required.
The patient had brief episodes of spiking minor temperatures while on the floor postoperatively.
He did have significant hematoma and swelling in the general area for which reason his Foley catheter was continued for a period of time.
He did noticed some incontinence and a condom catheter was used.
However, the patient did not exhibit gross bowel or bladder dysfunction.
The patient immediately postoperatively was noted to have a mass of abdominal distention.
He was nontender, however, the abdominal distention prompted nasogastric tube placement.
During his postoperative course the nasogastric tube was removed, however, the patient was unable to tolerate this and had mild nausea and continued distention and the nasogastric tube was eventually replaced.
The patient had KUBs that showed fairly significant ileus, however, no evidence of small bowel or large bowel obstruction.
His abdominal distention resolved without event.
He was noticed to have slight jaundice and elevated direct and indirect bilirubin consistent with massive hematoma resorption, this jaundice resolved prior to the patient's discharge.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient will let the primary care physician know of this and have an outpatient hematuria workup.
The patient did undergo a computerized tomography scan urogram to rule out a renal injury.
This showed no evidence of bladder or kidney injury.
The patient's pain was managed with Morphine PCA until he was able to tolerate p.o.
at which time his pain was adequately managed with Percocet.
Hydroxyzine 25 mg 2 every four to six hours to potentiate pain medication.
