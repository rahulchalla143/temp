There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: A&P: 68 M with CAD, HTN, CVA, chronic EtOH use presents with 3 month h/o worsening dyspnea, cough, leg edema.
The patient was found to have a large, fatty liver on US, and on exam demonstrates many of the stigmata of EtOH abuse.
The patient also had b/l LE edema and erythema for which he received levaquin to treat a possible cellulitis.
Pt was improving on the floor, ready for discharge to an acute reharb facility when he experienced several episodes of bilious vomiting.
Initial CT scan appeared to show a small bowel obstruction.
A NG tube was dropped, with bilious return.
Patients mental status continued to deteriorate over the course of the day, he became tachypneic, and somnolent.
He also became anuric, with little output after 2.5 liters in 24 hours.
The patient was eventually transferred to the unit with increasing ammonia levels, changes in mental status and decreased urine output.
In the MICU, pt's delirium and abdominal pain were believed to be a combination of untreated hepatic encephalopathy and SBO, with possible bowel perforation and SBP.
He was treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, Vanc and CTX for possible SBP with Flagyl for anaerobic coverage in case of perforation, and IV Albumin for likely hepatorenal syndrome.
Serial ammonia levels and lactates were followed, daily KUBs were done, as well as daily abdominal US to identify fluid collection for possible tap.
His acute renal failure was treated as hypovolemia vs. hepatorenal syndrome, so he was given albumin as above, plus fluids.
A macrocytic anemia was identified, and he was started on Vit B12 and folate.
As the patient became increasingly hemodynamically unstable with episodic hypotension and episodes of NSVT, the team decided to perform paracentesis to help better guide his therapy.
