Absence of flow  signal is observed in the left middle cerebral arterial branches at and beyond the bifurcation of this vessel.
This is suspicious for the presence of a thrombus in this location.
Cerebral angiography immediately followed this study.
MRI of the brain, demonstrating new area of slow diffusion within the right temporal-occipital lobe region, consistent with infarction.
Specifically, no significant area of stenosis is identified.
[**4-14**] CTA chest (PE protocol) No evidence of acute pulmonary embolus.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo CAD, high chol, and HTN who developed aphasia and right sided weakness at 12:30PM [**4-11**].
At 4pm (while in ED), developed worsening speech (fluent aphasia) and right facial droop.
After angio and t-PA with resolution of LMCA clot and improved sx, developed visual problems-unclear if field cut or blurred vision.
Had a repeat CT which was negative for bleed, and taken back for repeat angiogram which showed right PCA (P2) occlusion!
NEURO: His exam was notable only for a dense left field cut.
A Repeat MRI/MRA was performed on [**4-12**] that showed no L MCA stroke and patent MCA, with R PCA infarct (medial occip lobe, sparing pole).
Stroke workup included TEE that showed no ASD, no thrombus, but large complex atheroma in aorta (descending, ascending, arch).
Carotids on angio showed no evidence of stenosis.
Because of the atheroma and hx of two embolic strokes, he was started on coumadin for anticoagulation and continued on ASA for secondary stroke prevention.
Pulm He was stable until [**4-14**] when he developed a new O2 requirement and some tachypnea, chest CTA showed no evidence of PE and he was quickly weaned off of O2.
CXR follow up showed no evidence of pneumonia.
CV: He initially ruled out for MI with serial enzymes.
He was kept off of his atenolol initially because of low BP, but restarted on lopressor upon transfer to the floor.
Early in the morning on [**4-16**] he developed some feeling of chest pressure, he was given nitroglycerin without any relief.
Of note, when he was placed back on telemetry at the time of his chest pain he was noted to intermittently be in atrial fibrillation, not wiht rapid ventricular response.
ID: On [**4-14**] overnight he spiked a fever and workup was initiated that showed normal CXR and U/A and urine culture and blood culture were sent that are pending.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: R MCA territory stroke (likely cardioembolic), with aphasia and L sided weakness, succssfully thrombolysed with subsequent R PCA occlusion and L PCA territory infarction.
Discharge Condition: much improved, only with a L sided field cut.
