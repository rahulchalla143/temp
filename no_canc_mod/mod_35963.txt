Upon arrival she is intubated, not sedated, and with no spontaneous movement.
CT head demonstrates developing hydrocephalus with extensive intraventricular hemorrhage, predominantly in the fourth ventricle but extending to the third and lateral ventricles.
CT angiography demonstrates slightly ectatic left distal vertebral artery in the V4 segment above the level of foramen magnum could be due to atherosclerotic disease but focal abnormalities such as aneurysm or dissection cannot be excluded given the suboptimal opacification of the vascular structures.
No other abnormalities on the CT angiography of the head.
Suboptimal filling of the intracranial arteries is noted which could be related to increased intracranial pressure.
Extensive intraventricular hemorrhage with some subarachnoid hemorrhage and parenchymal hemorrhage surrounding the fourth ventricle, overall slightly decreased.
Decreased dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles.
