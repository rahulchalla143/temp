No detectable paraspinal abscess; however in the absence of OV contrast, this cannot be ruled out with certainity.
Persistent multifocal pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusion.
Tiny lucency in distal right tibia of uncertain etiology, but considered unlikely to represent a focus of osteomyelitis.
If clinically indicated, MRI or CT could help to further assess this finding.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 50 year old man with history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 10%), afib, DM2, obesity presenting after being found down on [**2174-8-18**].
RIJ placed and started on dopamine gtt for hypotension and sedated with versed.
Initial workup at the OSH showed an elevated BNP of 310, elevated WBC to 14.
ECHO done showed stable cardiomyopathy (EF 10%) and CXR with infrahilar opacification.
BAL showed viral inclusions on cytology.
From an infectious standpoint, multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, cultures postitive on [**8-18**] as listed above, then on [**8-25**] positive HSV1 on BAL.
Pt felt to be severely volume overloaded and wt as droped over 30 kg since coming to CCU.
The process was complicated by hyponatremia requiring frequent free water balances.
By [**9-10**] it was believed that we have overdiuresed the pt, Cr increaseing, BP dropping and fluid resesitant was began.
The pt's habitus also contributes to the resp distress and he becomes tachypnic and hypotensive when laying flat.
Patient subsequently developed higher fevers and was re-started on vanc/zosyn on [**2174-9-19**] per ID recs.
On [**9-21**], in the setting of worsening respiratory status with metabolic acidosis, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, it was decided that antibiotics were not helping and all were d/c'ed.
His breaths became markedly irregular and agonal, with short, gasping inhalations.
He was pronounced dead at 20:[**2086-9-15**] from respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and CHF>  # FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN) Despite finishing course of abx cefepime, levofloxacin, flagyl for [**8-18**] positive cultures, pt continued to spike fevers.
The WBC remained stable, sputum cultures + for pan-sensitive proteus, urine legionella Ag neg, sputum legionella cx neg to date, CT/CXR with b/l lower lobe consolidations.
Tib/Fib film no evidence of osteomyelitis.
TEE w/o evidence of endocarditis.
The source of fevers remained unclear.
Completed coarse of Acyclovir 1000mg IV q8h but continued to spike fevers up to 102.
A [**9-7**] WBC scan [**Last Name (un) **] only minor chest wall focus with no major chest or abd finding.
On [**9-11**] culture + MSSA in sputum and + pseudomonas in urine, and fever increased to 104.
BP remains low, HR high, febrile, unclear at this time if picture is septic or cardiogenic shock.
On [**9-19**] pt spiked fever to 103.1, which was higher than the fevers that he had previously been spiking frequently.
They remained unexplained; LUQ ultrasound showed no evidence of abscess near PEG tube site, TEE had no vegetations, chest/abdomen/pelvis CT showed no abscess or other concerning intrabdominal process.
On day of death, max temp was 107.1 F.  # HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
Had tolerated Captopril, but now held in setting of low BP and rising Cr.
throughout course patient was extremely dependent on CO.
When HR increased because of fever or tachyarrythmia uop would subsequently and reliably drop.
By [**9-20**], in the setting of marked fever and metabolic acidosis pt was tachycardic and hypotensive despite maximum dose of norepinephrine (0.45 mcg/kg/min).
#GI: PEG in place for fear of poor PO intake with trach.
Pt had large bilious return from PEG tube/ET tube and an ileus on CT that resolved after TF were held.
TF were subsequently re-started with no further ileus.
On [**9-19**] some concern was raised over the possibility of a peg site infection so a abdominal u/s was ordered, but was unrevealing.
Abdominal CT on [**9-20**] showed dilated bowel loops concerning for c. difficile colitis, but no obstruction or abscess.
# RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Likely pre-renal [**3-5**] severe CHF.
FeNa suggestive of pre-renal etiology.
Renal following.
Giving fluid boluses and monitoring UOP, which was noted to be exquisitely sensitive to blood pressure.
Urine output and Cr improved by [**9-19**], however by [**9-21**], in the setting of very high fevers and hypotension his urine output dropped to zero for multiple hours.
# Metabolic Alkalosis pH up to 7.6 on [**9-12**].
Originally attributed to contraction alkalosis [**3-5**] aggressive lasix diuresis.
Thought be be [**3-5**] to GI losses with large NG output.
# DELIRIUM / CONFUSION Pt becomes aggitated at times, and has managed to pull out an A-line, and IJ.
Stable on Zyprexa  # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) Admitted with Afib and RVR.
Moderate response with IV dilt.
Anti-coagulation held at first because of coagulopathy and then re-started with goal INR [**3-6**].
On 8  # COAGULOPATHY Possible sources since the last coumadin was given on [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.
Hepatic possible given poor CO and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was ischemia.
