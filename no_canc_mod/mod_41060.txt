He was converted to atrial fibrillation with a Lidocaine drip.
He had no chest pain.
He did admit to occasional episodes of light-headedness and dizziness over the past two to three weeks with two episodes of syncope.
He was admitted last week with congestive heart failure and was dizzy during his admission with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s that was felt to be secondary to his medications.
The night prior he then had another episode of light-headedness and syncope.
Chronic atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion.
Congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathy.
Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Colon cancer status post resection.
History of Bell's palsy.
It was suspected that his ventricular arrhythmias were due to some active ischemia and recommended an ET consult before catheterization for question of ET ablation or AV nodal ablation.
He had a cardiac catheterization done which showed an ejection fraction of approximately 20%, 30% left main lesion, 70% LAD lesion, 70% circumflex lesion with an 80% lesion of the major OM branch, and a 90 to 95% lesion of the right coronary artery.
He had no high-grade ventricular ectopy in the day or two prior to surgery, no confusion or central nervous system changes on Lidocaine, and no congestive heart failure by exam.
On postoperative day one he had no events overnight.
An HIT panel was sent and was pending for his noticeable drop in platelet count.
He remained in the Cardiothoracic ICU, on the following day restarted his Carvedilol, Captopril and aspirin and continued with diuresis and finished his perioperative antibiotics.
On postoperative day three he went back into atrial fibrillation and his blood pressure was low but stable.
He had mild peripheral edema.
He had some crackles at the bases of his lungs with some mild peripheral edema.
His sternal incision was intact, and the plan was to have AICD done on [**2114-10-26**] during the day, which he underwent.
His sternal incision was stable with staples clean, dry, intact.
His left shoulder AICD incision had Steri-Strips, was also clean, dry, intact.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Cardiomyopathy with history of congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease.
