He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 54870**] with severe PCP pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.
Although he was markedly hypoxic on admission, he quickly improved and was extubated.
He was discharged home on 2 more weeks of treatment-dose bactrim as well as a prednisone taper, both of which he completed the day prior to presentation, [**12-14**].
By the second week, he noticed he was having fevers to 102 at home.
He then developed some worsening shortness of breath with exertion.
A couple of days ago, he started having a cough productive of white sputum.
He also recently had a fever blister on his bottom lip.
Exam was notable for crackles at his bases.
CXR showed b/l patchy infiltrates, improved from prior.
He was admitted to the ICU for care because of his poor respiratory status.
Upon arrival to the ICU, he had no complaints.

[**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) 76235**] cytopathic effect  Na [**2147-12-27**]: 132  Brief Hospital Course: 41 year old man with HIV (CD4 26) and recent severe PCP pneumonia who was readmitted with recurrent fever, DOE, and cough after initial significant improvement.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations included CMV pneumonitis, fungal infection, other opportunistic infections, or LIP.
A HRCT of the chest showed diffuse ground glass opacities in both lungs (nonspecific but consistent with PCP) and less consolidation than previous CT chest (done during the initial presentation).
The BAL, however, was positive for RSV and he was placed on respiratory precautions (no specific treatment available).
His repeat CMV viral load became positive at >10.000 copies per ML.
Therefore, he was placed on Ganciclovir to treat presumed CMV pneumonitis ( again its controversial whether he has CMV pneumonitis or its a clinically insignificant finding as clinical CMV in AIDS patients is less defined than transplant patients).
His recurrent symptoms were believed to be secondary to intercurrent HSV infection or CVM pneumonitis and not recurrent/relapsed PCP.

The patient developed hyponatremia related to SIADH from lung disease.
The patient has hyponatremia secondary to SIADH from pulmonary disease (recent PCP infection and now RSV/CMV infection).
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for pulmonary rehabilitation.

You developed low sodium (salt) in your [**Name Initial (PRE) **] and we placed you on water restriction.
The low salt is related to your active lung disease or infection.
If your lung symptoms do not improve, you will need a lung biopsy to rule out other diseases such as (LIP).
