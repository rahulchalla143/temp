No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is moderate improvement of LVEF global systolic function.
Aortic valve area calculations by continuity is 1.2 cm2 with peak aortic velocity at 2.1m/sec.
He presented in respiratory distress and responded to diuresis.
He had an echocardiogram which demonstrated that his left ventricular function was depressed with moderate to severe regional systolic dysfunction and ejection fraction about 25%.
His aortic valve showed minimal aortic stenosis.
There was also a mass that was in the left ventricle and it appeared to be attached to the papillary muscle suggestive of a fibroblastoma or torn chord.
He had a small mitral palpable muscle mass which was suggestive of a torn chord.
He was brought to the operating room on [**2106-3-18**] where the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and the diagonal artery.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
He did have some dizziness and orthostatic hypotension which improved with albumin.
He had scant sternal drainage which had improved at the time of discharge with no drainage noted for 48 hours.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 7 the patient was ambulating freely, tolerating a full oral diet and the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
