She was started on Bactrim on [**12-8**] and Linezolid on [**12-7**] for positive sputum and urine cx's.
- h/o Osteomyelitis T6-T8 with cord compression: s/p T6-7 corpectomy with T5-8 strut graft/fusion on [**2136-10-19**], s/p T3-L3 fusion w/bone graft on [**2136-11-2**], on long-term nafcillin - h/o MSSA epidural abscesses from L4-brain: s/p multiple drainages during prior admissions - h/o ATN requiring HD, now with CRI (recent baseline 1.2-1.4) - anemia likley [**2-23**] ACD, on epo (recent baseline hct 26-28) - h/o upper GIB (no recent scopes in OMR) - COPD - h/o transudative pleural effusion - h/o sepsis - h/o drug resistant acinetobacter from sputum cx (sensitive to tobramycin) - h/o VRE UTI - h/o resp failure: s/p trach and PEG [**2136-11-9**], continues to require vent at rehab - persistent diarrhea (C.diff negative) - Mental retardation - DVT [**1-/2130**] - NIDDM - Obesity - Sciatica - Hypertension - Hypercholesterolemia - Anxiety - Psoriasis - Paroxysmal A. fib - cholelithiasis .
Cardio: distant heart sounds Resp: rhonchi BL anteriorly Abd: soft, obese, mild epigastric tenderness, no rebound/guarding, +BS.
Chest CT Scan, [**2136-12-13**]: Persistent left lower lobe consolidations with moderate left pleural effusion.
This may represent atelectasis, but superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Small right lower lobe consolidation and effusion, but no new airspace consolidations.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Persistent left retrocardiac opacity which appears to have increased in comparison to the prior study.
This may represent atelectasis and/or consolidation.
If this is clinically feasible, further evaluation with dedicated PA and lateral radiographs may be beneficial in characterizing this further.
Interval placement of a right PICC, with the tip not well visualized secondary to overlying metallic hardware.
A/P: 64 yo f with MMP, including spinal osteomyelitis, CRI, s/p trach and PEG, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**], now with recurrent fevers.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course: Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for recurrent fevers.
She had multiple possible sources for her infection including UTI (has chronic foley), known osteomyelitis and epidural abscesses, sacral decubitus ulcer, PICC line (placed on [**2136-11-26**]), and possible PNA.
This was thought to likely represent a contaminant.
She has anemia of chronic disease and was found to have a Hct upon admission 22.8 for which she was transfused one unit PRBCs.
The patient has a history of eosinophilia of unclear etiology.
#) Fever: The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics with persistent fevers.
She actually defervesed and at the time of her discharge she had not had fevers for 48 hours.
Had high RR initially, but oxygenation remained good and these were attributed to anxiety/agitation.
#) Abdominal tenderness: pt with hx of colonic thickening seen on prior CT's.
#) Vertebral osteo: Initially treated with linezolid, but this was thought to be cause of patient's fever.
