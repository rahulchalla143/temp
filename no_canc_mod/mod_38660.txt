results:  [**2-4**] ECHO: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric jet of Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial diastolic collapse is seen.
Ejection fraction has decreased significantly.
The degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and estimated PA systolic pressures have increased.
[**2-4**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Possible left atrial enlargement.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities are diffusely seen.
T wave inversions previously seen in the precordial leads are no longer apparent and have been replaced non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
No change in configuration of anterior abdominal wall defect and enterocutaneous fistula.
No evidence of abscess, obstruction, or perforation.
Unchanged right greater than the left bilateral pleural effusions.
[**2-6**] CXR: As compared to the previous examination, the pre-existing small right-sided pleural effusion has substantially increased in extent.
As a consequence, the right lung base has decreased in transparency.
Also decreased in transparency have the left basal lung areas, mainly as a consequence of the newly occurred retrocardiac atelectasis.
Newly occurred minimal left-sided pleural effusion.
[**2-6**] renal US: No hydronephrosis or obstruction in both kidneys.
[**2-9**] Bladder US: No mass, stone or large hematoma is seen within the partially distended urinary bladder.
[**2-10**] Urine Cytology:  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Reactive urothelial cells, present singly and in clusters,   consistent with instrumentation effect.

CT abdomen and pelvis on [**2-4**] showed no abdominal collection, and unchaged R>L bl pleural effusions.
An ECHO showed LVEF of 30-35%, MR [**11-25**]+, and moderate PA systolic hypertension.
Sepsis:  ID was consulted on [**2-4**] and sepsis was intiallly thought to be due to PICC bloodstream infection or urosepsis.
The PICC tip and 1 of 2 blood cultures were positive for klebsiella.
There was concern that her ativan might not be cleared in the context of acute renal failure, so ativan and seroquel were stopped until she became more alert.
Acute renal failure:  Renal consult obtained on [**2-7**], and thought that this was likely due to multiple episodes of ATN.
Thorough laboratory workup and examination of urine revealed no other causes.
She became supratherapeutic with a peak of 4.1 on [**2-8**], and her coumadin was held.
Hematuria: Patient noted to have hematuria on admission (>50 RBCs), which may have been present for several days/weeks prior to admission.
Abdominal Pain:  Patient had intermittent abdominal pain and tenderness throughout her hospitalization, which was thought to be at her baseline.
She was started on oral morphine for pain control, which decreased the nausea she had experienced with dilaudid.
