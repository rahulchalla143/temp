Admission Date:  [**2112-2-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2112-2-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2034-6-18**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CICU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Back pain and chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, and temporal arteritis, who had a sudden onset of back pain radiating to the chest wall wiping off her car at 10:45 on the morning of admission.
The patient denies any history of chest pain, this type of back pain, no history of lower back pain.
The patient describes pain as in the interscapular radiating to her chest [**11-11**] and constant.
Pain is associated with diaphoresis, but no nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath.
The pain is currently [**5-12**] when she arrived in the CCU.
The patient at the outside hospital was treated with sublingual nitroglycerin x3 with resolution of the chest pain, but her back pain was still present, and the blood pressure remained elevated at 195/68 in the right and 185/60 to the left.
The patient was given a total of 60 mg of Morphine with a relief of the pain of [**3-14**].
She had a CT scan of the chest with contrast which showed acute versus chronic descending aortic dissection not extending to the renal arteries.
Here, the patient was started on an Esmolol drip and she remained chest pain and back pain free.
However, her blood pressure remained elevated at 213/87.
She was started on Nipride drip at 2 mcg/kg/minute, however, the patient then became hypotensive 90/palp, and Nipride was turned off, and she was restarted on Nipride at a much lower dose with the Esmolol, and her blood pressure normalized at 135/65.
Patient was seen by CT Surgery, who saw no need for surgical intervention because the patient had a descending aortic aneurysm.
Hypertension at least 20 years in duration and normal blood pressure roughly around 150/80 that she takes at home.
Silent myocardial infarction in [**2110**] and history of coronary artery disease.
She had a Thallium stress in [**2110-2-3**] which revealed a reversible inferolateral defect and posterior bibasilar scar, but the patient refused cardiac catheterization at that time.
Of note, the patient denies this history, but it is noted from our outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35643**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient had previously taken Lipitor, but had a myositis with a response of Lipitor, and therefore she has an allergy to Lipitor noted on her records.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Patient had a sister who died of a myocardial infarction at 62, and a father died of a myocardial infarction at 49.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No headache, no visual changes, no chest pain, no palpitations, lightheadedness, or dizziness.
No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, no cough, or shortness of breath.
She had two episodes of nausea on arrival, and no diarrhea or abdominal pain.
In general, she is in no acute distress.
She had no cardiac bruits, no jugular venous distention.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.
Extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
She has no focal findings.
She had a urinalysis at the outside hospital which showed ketones, trace blood, no protein, no leukocyte esterase, and no nitrites.
She also had a question of a mass in her extra-thoracic along the patient's stomach although she has a history of hiatal hernia.
She had a chest x-ray which showed clear, no evidence of congestive heart failure or mediastinum.
Of note, she has a past cardiac workup including the following:  An echocardiogram in [**2111-4-3**] which showed a normal left ventricular size with low systolic dysfunction.
She had akinesis of the posterior basilar wall.
She had a Thallium stress test done in [**2110-2-3**] which showed moderate areas of decreased Thallium uptake in the inferolateral region which resolved with rest and there was a fixed defect in the posterior basilar region, and the patient refused a cardiac catheterization.
Cardiovascular:  As mentioned, this patient came in with back pain, some mild chest pain at that point, and elevated blood pressures treated with Esmolol and nitroglycerin drip which were titrated to give her a blood pressure of roughly 130-140 systolic.
Her back pain completely resolved by the second day of hospitalization, and her blood pressures remained stable as did her heart rate in the generally the 70s or 80s normal sinus rhythm.
The CT scan was read as a possible acute and chronic dissection of the thoracic aorta.
It subsequently led to the dissection either initiation of dissection or worsening of chronic dissection.
There is otherwise no clear etiology of the sudden increase in her chronic hypertension, so it is hypothesized that it could be an extension of the dissection to the renal artery, however, there is no evidence of this on CT scan.
From a coronary artery disease standpoint, there were no symptoms or electrocardiogram changes, and she has no ischemic disease at this point, and there is no indication for cardiac catheterization or further stress test.
As mentioned previously, the patient would qualify for statin therapy, however, given her previous myositis from starting Lipitor, that she was refrained from starting it again.
Rheumatologic:  The patient has a history of temporal arteritis, so she was continuing on her prednisone 5 mg po q day alternating with 2.5 mg po q day.
Hematologic:  The patient had a drop in her hematocrit from admission from 36.3 to 28.7, however, it was subsequently at 33.3 without any transfusions and remained stable.
There was no evidence of acute bleed.
Chronic and possibly acute descending aortic dissection.
Coronary artery disease.
