Pt was found to be complaining of feeling dizzy and SOB at her NH, then was found down.
She arrived with PEA arrest.
CT of the chest showed a large almost saddle right sided PE with multiple small right PEs.

There is a lucency surrounding the aortic arch that potentially might represent small amount of pneumothorax.
Minimal left apical pneumothorax also cannot be excluded.
The left basal opacity has some triangular appearance and most likely a combination of consolidation and atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo f with hx of dementia, now s/p cardiac arrests in setting of PE and PEA arrest, with pneumothorax s/p chest tube, now intubated and unresponsive having myoclonic jerks.
# Hypotension/Cardiac arrest: Secondary to large PE.
Pt had a prolonged arrest and is continuing to have hypotension.
CE at the OSH and her CK here are elevated, likely secondary to her CPR, but ischemia can not be excluded.
She was at risk for hypoperfussion induced cardiac ischemic injury.
However, due to PE and prolonged code and time since her code patient was not a good candidate for cooling protocol given concern for coagulopathy and overall poor outcome.
# Pulmonary embolism: Pt had a large right PE and this likely triggered the cardiac arrest.
No thrombolysis given extremely poor prognosis.
# Altered mental status/myoclonic jerks: Pt was unresponsive to all stimuli except a minimal amount of pupilary constriction.
This was likely [**1-31**] both her prolonged hypoperfusion during her code likely causing anoxic brain injury and her elevated lactate causing a significant metabolic acidosis.
Her head CT at [**Hospital1 **] had no significant findings, but was likely too soon after her event to show anoxic injury.
Sedation was held and metabolic abnormalities were corrected.
# Acidosis: Metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis.
She is also CO2 retaining despite her elevated RR.
# Pneuomthorax: Secondary to subcalvian line placement attempt on right.
Pt has extensive subcutanteous air on chest wall.
# Coagulopathy: Likely in setting of shock, fibrinogrin likely low due to clot formation.
