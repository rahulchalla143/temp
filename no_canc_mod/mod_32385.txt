**FINAL REPORT [**2105-8-22**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2105-8-22**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
ESCHERICHIA COLI.
No definite vascular congestion.
There is increased opacification at the right base medially.
The left hemidiaphragm is relatively well seen, though there may well be some atelectatic change involving the left lower lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo M with h/o IDDM, dCHF, afib on coumadin presenting with right foot pain, found to have cellulitis who was transferred to the ICU on the night of his admission for dyspnea.
#Reason for MICU transfer: on arrival to the floor, the patient's temperature increased to 103 and he was tachycardic with rates in the 160-170s and tachypneic and wheezy who met SIRs criteria and was admitted to the ICU.
While in the ICU, EKG showed  ST depressions in lateral precordial leads.
Cardiology was consulted and EKGs showed resolution of these changes with administration of IV metoprolol, therefore likely demand ischemia.
met criteria for severe sepsis given his tachycardia, fever, and leukocytosis on admission with elevated lactate.
He was febrile to 103 with altered mental status.
His urine grew out pansensitive E Coli and cefepime was swithced to cipro and was dsicharged on a total 5 day course.
#Right foot pain- his right foot had increased redness and on arrival to the ED there was concern that this could signify cellulitis.
Furthermore, patient has had toe pain for nearly one year.
he was treated empirically with Ceftriaxone/Vancomycin/Ciprofloxacin but only cipro for uti at time of dc.
Over the night he developed worsening dyspnea.
CXR did not show any pulmonary edema but did show an opacity in the RLL.
This could have signified an aspiration pnuemonia however he notably has had a RLL opacification on prior CXR in [**2101**] making aspiration event less likey.
He likely had flash pulmonary edema in the setting of a-fib with RVR.
He had no further episodes of severe dyspnea during his MICU and floor stay.
#Atrial Fibrillation- in the setting of an infeciton, he developed afib with RVR.
#diastolic heart failure-patient has history of diastolic dysfunction which likely contributed to flash pulmonary edema.
No further management changes were made for his chronic condition.
HAD ELEVATED URIC ACID LEVEL.
