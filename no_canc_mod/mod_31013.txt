NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: It is not clear whether there is  intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or only intraventricular bleeding.
There is hydrocephalus and transependymal resorption of CSF.
CTA HEAD [**5-25**]: Normal CTA, no evidence of aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.
Ventricular decompression status post placement of a ventricular drain.
Small amount of intracranial air compatible with recent surgery.
No arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm greater than 3 mm, or flow-limiting stenosis.
Mild asymmetric narrowing of right M1 atherosclerotic disease.
MRI HEAD [**5-26**]: Stable intraventricular blood products compared to the most recent prior study without evidence of progressive bleeding.
Pelvis X-ray [**5-26**]: There is a left total hip arthroplasty.
There are no signs for hardware-related complications.
There are severe degenerative changes of the right hip with complete loss of joint space, large osteophytes, and subchondral sclerosis.
No displaced fractures are seen.
There are severe degenerative change of the lower lumbar spine as well.
This was revealing for an aqueductal hemorrhage and significant hydrocephalus.
CTA of the head was also done, and did not show any finite cause of her bleeding.
On [**5-26**], her examination was with minimal improvement, so palliative care consult was obtained to discuss goals of care.
