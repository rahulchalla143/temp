2)RUQ Ultrasound ([**9-1**]): Preliminary report: Known splenic vein thrombosis with extension to the portosplenic confluence, which appears nonocclusive.
The main portal vein also displays a nonocclusive thrombus with the intrahepatic veins and portal system appearing patent and with normal flows.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 79209**] is a 46yo male with history of cirrhosis [**3-13**] NASH, Crohn's disease, diabetes, known esophageal varices, presenting with hematemesis, intubated and in fair condition.

He immediately underwent an upper endoscopy which showed both esophageal varices as well as gastric varices.
He was also noted to have prominent gastric varices that were of concern.
He has a known splenic thrombus but the ultrasound here showed extension of the clot into the porto-splenic confluence as well as involvement of the SMV.
2)Splenic vein thrombosis: Patient has known splenic vein thrombosis.
After talking with hepatology, the decision was made to start the patient on a heparin gtt (no bolus) with goal PTT of 60-70 given his acute bleed and platelet count.
The Nadolol was held given the acute loss of blood.
