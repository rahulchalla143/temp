She has had multiple endoscopic procedures attempting to open her left main stem a stent placed from [**2175-1-11**] with endobronchial steroid in the LMS due to narrowing which was removed on [**2175-6-1**] with some temporary improvement.
She was most recently seen in pulmonary clinic [**2175-9-26**] with inspiratory wheeze noted in the LLL with CT trachea showing recurrent narrowing of the LMS.
Towards the end of the procedure she became hypoxemic to 85% RA with low tidal volumes  and was intubated with a 7.5french tube with propofol 50mcg/kg/min.
She subsequently became hypotensive with BP to 69/49 and was started on phenylephrine at 2:30pm with 500cc IVF fluid bolus x 2 given.
She was started on vanc/zosyn for post obstructive PNA.

Small pulmonary emboli are at subsegmental level in right lower lobe.
The patient is known with granulomatosis polyangiitis (Wegener's).
The disease is mostly affecting the airways with multiple chronic area of narrowing.
Small tiny bulla of air anterior to the distal main bronchus could be related to microperforation secondary to recent bronchoscopy.
Multiple areas of consolidation and bronchiolar opacities are new, mostly in bilateral lower lobes.
LOWER EXTREMITIES DOPPLER US [**2175-10-8**]: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
Multifocal basilar-predominant consolidation and diffuse ill-defined nodular opacities, similar to prior study.
Findings are compatible with multifocal pneumonia possibly coexisting with pulmonary hemorrhage in this patient with known vasculitis.
Moderate left and small right pleural effusion are similar to prior.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 y/o F with history of Granulomatosis with polyangitis complicated by tracheobronchial disease presenting to the ICU following post procedural intubation with course complicated by sepsis, serratia post-obstructive pneumonia.
# Hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: On imaging she had left lung collapse with difficulty on initial rigid bronchoscopy in opening up left mainstem.
She became hypoxemic after initial extubation in the PACU and was thus re-intubated and sent to the MICU.
Given a suspected postobstructive PNA she was treated initially with vanc/zosyn and subsequently zosyn alone.
In order to guide further intervention of her left mainstem occlusion, she had a CTA to define the pulmonary and tracheobronchial architecture.
She went back to the OR for repeat rigid bronchoscopy no stent placed, but had therapeutic aspiration of secretions and debridement of scar tissue with recannalisation of left upper and lower lobe segments.
Bronchial washings grew Serritia Marcenscens.
# Hypotension: Pt developed hypotension periprocedurally initially thought to be secondary to propofol but this persisted despite switching to fentanyl and versed for sedation.
# Post-Obstrucive Pneumonia Complicated by Septic Shock: Elevated WBC in MICU with hypotension.
CT chest showed multiple areas of consolidation and bronchiolar opacities.
On the floor, patient had one episode of desaturation down to 85%.
# mucus plugging: she had an episode of tachypnea and wheezing on the floor that responded to nebs and chest PT.
# Granulomatosis with polyangitis: She hs On last evaluation in pulmonary clinic clinically appeared to be doing well although with radiographic evidence of narrowing of LMS.
Has extensive pulmonary disease with bronchial and parenchymal involvement with granulomas and copious secretions.
She has had multiple endoscopic procedures particularly to address occlusion of the left main stem and had 2 such procedures this admission.
Doppler showed thrombis around her midline in the Brachial vein.
# Pulmonary Embolism.
CTA [**10-6**] showed a small pulmonary emboli are at subsegmental level in right lower lobe.
A decision was made not to anticoagulate due to the risk of bleeding secondary to both inflammation in the airways and mechanical injury secondary to rigid bronchoscopies.
viscous lidocaine used for pain relief.
# Diarrhea: She developed diarrhea while in the ICU.
No abdominal pain.
Likely secondary to antibiotics.
During her MICU stay she became bradycardic and was found on EKG to have a QTC in the 500s.
# Anemia: Initial drop in HCT from 41.6 [**9-5**] to 34.5 on admission (but baseline ~ 38).
#Lower extremity edema: no hx CHF with EF [**2174**] 60-65%, mild pulmonary artery HTN Lasix held in MICU and restarted on the floor.
# s/p Breast cancer treated with mastectomy, right lympadenectomy and chemotherapy in [**2143**].
