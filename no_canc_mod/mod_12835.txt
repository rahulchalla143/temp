Admission Date: [**2173-5-5**]        Discharge Date: [**2173-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-3-1**]        Sex:  F  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for an upper GI bleed.
The patient was originally admitted on [**4-23**] with cellulitis of her left hand.
She underwent an irrigation and debridement of her hand for treatment of this abscess versus cellulitis.
However, a few days ago the patient began complaining of some abdominal pain and the right upper quadrant ultrasound subsequently demonstrated the presence of stones, but no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Endoscopy that was performed showed a duodenal ulcer with a fresh blood clot.
In addition, is that the patient had elevated creatinines upon discharge and is at the time of discharge noted to be anuric.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is significant for coronary artery disease, including a cardiac catheterization in [**2171-9-23**] that showed moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction and 1 vessel coronary artery disease and an ejection fraction of 63%.
The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, pericarditis and is status post a pericardial window and endometrial cancer.
She had dilatation and curettage.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
In general she was alert and oriented and in no acute distress with mild pallor and obese.
Her cardiovascular exam had a holosystolic murmur of [**3-28**].
Her abdomen was obese and soft with positive epigastric and left upper quadrant pain.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In brief, the patient was noted to be in anuric acute renal failure likely secondary to hypoperfusion from this lower GI bleed.
Subsequently her hospitalization was complicated by sepsis, respiratory failure ultimately requiring intubation, and the sepsis requiring several antibiotics and several pressors.
No atrial stenosis initially on admission.
However, likely because of her septic shock and GI bleeding, the patient required Levophed to maintain her systolic blood pressure.
In addition, because of her complicated hemodynamic status, she initially required monitoring with a Swan Ganz catheter, which was ultimately changed to a triple lumen catheter on hospital day 6.
Early on multiple attempts were made to wean the Levophed, which was found to be extremely difficult.
However, she developed a right lower lung opacity and a pneumonia, as well as a pleural effusion and became obtunded.
The patient was also noted at some point to have evidence of cirrhosis.
From a renal perspective the patient's anuria ultimately resolved and her creatinine slowly drifted down once better renal perfusion was achieved with the use of Levophed and IV fluids, and the patient began making urine several days after admission.
It was believed that thus her renal failure was secondary to hyperperfusion as a renal ultrasound on admission was within normal limits.
However, because of the development of right lower lobe pneumonia the patient was switched to levofloxacin and vancomycin.
Acute renal failure.
Urinary tract infection.
