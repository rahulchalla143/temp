The patient did well for many years but has recurrent angina.
The patient has also had multiple stenting of both his native circulation and vein grafts and most recently had an intervention to the Y vein graft which was not successful.
The patient had recurrent angina and was therefore referred for third time redo bypass surgery.
Past Medical History: allergies: Spironolactone; Radioactive Diagnostics, General Classif Coronary artery disease, including   Prior inferior myocardial infarction   s/p CABG [**2137**] and [**2149**]   s/p multiple percutaneous coronary interventions Hypertension.
Diabetes mellitus with   Peripheral neuropathy.
Mild chronic renal insufficiency.
Severe left ventricular diastolic heart failure Possible right posterior thorax radiation burn.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Family History: Mother had heart disease with a mild MI in her 60's.
In general, he was very pleasant elderly male in no acute distress, somewhat obese and mildly short of breath.
His skin was notable to have a radiation burn on his back as well as multiple well healed incisions.
There was no JVD.
His heart had a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft systolic ejection murmur was best heard over the aortic region.
His abdomen was obese, somewhat firm, but nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.
He did have venostasis and rubor changes noted bilaterally.
In evaluating his greater saphenous vein, he had multiple incisions on his leg.
His femoral pulses were absent as well as his dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis bilaterally.
Overnight on Friday he developed a lactic acidosis to 10 which resolved by morning with weaning of the epinephrine.
Gradually he developed respiratory distress and was intubated later in the evening.
Because of intestinal ischemia concern he was brought to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy which was negative.
An intra-operative echo showed poor right ventricular function.
He was subsequently brought to the cath lab to rule out an occluded right bypass graft.
Oxygenation was maintained with a high peep.
CVVH was initiated and acidosis controlled with bicarb dialysate.
His chest was opened but also resulted in no improvement.
