TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired contiguous axial images from the thoracic inlet through the upper abdomen were obtained without intravenous contrast.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A small hydropneumothorax is again demonstrated in the left hemithorax.
The amount of hyperdense fluid within the hydropneumothorax is unchanged since the prior exam, but there has been interval decrease in the density of this complex fluid ([**Doctor Last Name **] 30), consistent with evolving hemothorax.
Air within the apical component of the hydropneumothorax has nearly resolved, but there is a slightly increased amount of air within the basilar component.
The hyperdense bilobed pneumatocele containing an air- fluid level in the left lower lobe is stable in size and appearance from the prior exam.
The ground glass opacification surrounding the pneumatocele in the left lower lobe has improved in the interval, representing resolving contusion.
Additionally, a focal cluster of tiny ground glass nodular opacities in the posterior right upper lobe may represent an area of focal subclinical aspiration.
The airways are patent to the level of segmental bronchi bilaterally.
A calcified right paratracheal lymph node is again demonstrated.
There is interval decrease in the amount of subcutaneous emphysema within the anterior chest wall and soft tissues.
Bone windows again demonstrate multiple contiguous displaced rib fractures on the left, unchanged in the interval.
IMPRESSION:  1) Stable appearance of post-traumatic left lower lobe pneumatocele with intraluminal hemorrhage.
2) Small left hemopneumothorax with slight interval increase in amount of air in the basilar component of the hemopneumothorax, but near complete resolution of air within the apical component.
3) Improving right lower lobe atelectasis.
4) Focal clustered centrilobular opacities, likely due to subclinical aspiration in posterior segment of the right lobe upper lobe.
(please perform CXR at 19:00) REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval: PTX (please perform CXR at 19:00) INDICATION: 43-year-old male with left pneumatocele and left pneumothorax status post chest tube removal.
Left apical pneumothorax has decreased in size.
Left lower lung opacity corresponding with known pneumatocele and unchanged compared to prior.
No focal opacities.
Small left pleural effusion unchanged.
Interval improvement in left apical pneumothorax with tiny pneumothorax appreciated.
Unchanged loculated small left pleural effusion.
Unchanged left lower lobe opacity consistent with history of pneumatocele.
Neurosurgery was consulted because of his a small SAH identified on CT imaging; a CTA revealed no dissection.
No operative intervention warranted.
Thoracic surgery was consulted because of a pneumatocele and lung contusions.
No surgical intervention; he will remain in a hard cervical collar for 2 weeks and will follow up with the Spine surgeon for repeat imaging of his cervical spine.
Acute pain service was also consulted because of his rib fractures; he was initially a PCA for pain control and later changed to oral narcotics.
His pain is currently controlled with prn Ibuprofen and Oxycodone.
Milk of Magnesia 800 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: One (1)  PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
