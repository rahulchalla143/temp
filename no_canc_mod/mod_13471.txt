Physical Exam: Vitals: T 99.4, 83 NSR, 102/60, RR 17, 100% on vent GEN: intubated, sedated HEENT:  NC/AT, anicteric sclera, mmm NECK: supple, no carotid bruits CHEST:  CTA bilat CV: RRR without mur ABD: softly distended, +BS, no HSM EXTREM: trace edema x 4, DP pulses 2+ bilaterally, aline right arm, knee scar over left knee  NEURO: MENTAL STATUS: nonverbal, unresponsive to voice and painful stimuli (intubated, sedated) CRANIAL NERVES:   Pupil exam: 4->2mm bilaterally   EOM exam: no dolls   Corneal reflex: + bilaterally   Facial symmetry: winces upper face symmetrically, ETT obstructs exam of lower face   Gag reflex: no gag to ETT wiggle MOTOR:  no motor response to pain, no spontaneous movement, normal symmetric tone x 4 SENSORY: winces face to pain x 4 REFLEXES: 1+ bilat [**Hospital1 **]/tri/BR, 1 on right pat, absent left patellar (surgery), 1 ach bilat, down going toes bilaterally  Upon awakening and extubation, patient was slow to answer questions and mildly inattentive (but this improved next day).
Motor exam normal (slightly limited by pain but if asked for full strength for one second, he is full strength).
The heart is not enlarged, atelectasis is present in both the right and left lower lobes.
No definite pneumonia is present.
MRI/A brain with gad and stroke protocol:  1) MRI is somewhat limited, but reveals no areas of edema or infarction.
There is no evidence of an enhancing intracranial mass.
EEG: ABNORMALITY #1: There were frequent brief bursts of mixed frequency theta and delta slowing with a bifrontal emphasis.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were additional bursts of slowing in the delta range seen primarily over the left frontal temporal region.
BACKGROUND: Background rhythm included a well-formed 10 Hz alpha frequency in posterior areas bilaterally during wakefulness.
SLEEP: The patient appeared to remain awake or minimally drowsy throughout the recording.
No stage II sleep was obtained.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the occasional bursts of bifrontal or generalized slowing and due to the minimal slowing in the left anterior quadrant.
These findings suggest focal subcortical abnormalities in the left hemisphere or in deeper midline structures (or both).
Nevertheless, there were no areas of persistent focal slowing.
This find may result from vascular disease or other causes.
There were no epileptiform features.
And when sedation was lightened at OSH he was awake but not following commands, thus rose the concern for nonconvulsive status.
MRI/A of brain with gad and stroke protocol was obtained as an adequate exam was not able to be obtained off sedation and CT at OSH showed a small area of encephalomalacia.
Pain service was consulted and recommended ativan for bzdp withdrawl and restarting multiple home meds (including baclofen, neurontin, indomethicin).
EEG showed bifrontal slowing.
He requested rehab for both back pain and detoxification.
