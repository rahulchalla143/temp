Admission Date:  [**2153-9-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2153-9-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2153-9-4**]       Sex:  M  Service:  NICU HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Boy [**Known lastname 13144**] was [**Known lastname **] to a 32 year old gravida 2, para 2 to 3 mother at 34 4/7 weeks gestation secondary to premature rupture of membranes.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Anterior fontanelle soft and flat, nondysmorphic, palate intact, neck and mouth normal, mild nasal flaring prior to C-PAP tube placement.
Respiratory:  Initially, [**Known lastname **] had some respiratory distress but was stabilized on C-PAP.
He did not require surfactant until day of life number two, [**2153-9-6**], when his respiratory status had deteriorated slightly overnight with increased oxygen requirement and increased pressure requirement.
He was easily extubated on the following day, day of life number three, [**2153-9-7**], and put into a nasal cannula, from which he also easily weaned and, by day of life number five, he was in room air with no subsequent respiratory distress.
[**Known lastname **] did experience infrequent bradycardic episodes thought to be secondary to respiratory immaturity.
He was monitored and had been asymptomatic for a period of five days prior to discharge home.
Cardiovascular:  On day of life number six, [**Known lastname **] was noted to have increased blood pressures.
Although his systolic blood pressure remains intermittently in the high-normal range of 85-90 mmHg, he has had no further systolic peaks above 100, and it was not felt that the finding was pathologic.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  [**Known lastname **] had initial mild hypoglycemia but, after day of life number one, he has been feeding regularly and is drinking breast milk on an ad lib basis, with good weight gain.
Neurologic:  [**Known lastname **] has had no abnormal findings.
Sensory:  Hearing screening was performed with automated auditory brain stem responses and the patient passed his hearing screen.
Ophthalmology:  The patient was not examined as he was not premature enough to require any examinations for retinopathy of prematurity.
Surfactant deficiency and respiratory distress syndrome, resolved.
Apnea/bradycardia of prematurity 4.
Mild physiologic hyperbilirubinemia, resolved without treatment.
