Admission Date:  [**2147-2-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-2-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-11-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: temporary and subsequent permanent pacemaker placement   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 74 y/o F with a PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia and MR (resident at group home) who presents from her day program with syncope.
EKG was without ischemic changes and per EP no anticoagulation was initiated.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Patient denies dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Depression Mental retardation   Social History: Lives at group home.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Lung volumes are mildly diminished.
There is mild engorgement of the vascular pedicle with mild superimposed edema.
No definite consolidation is noted.
Echo - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Interstitial markings have diminished somewhat since the prior study.
The lateral view demonstrates posterior effusions and some retrocardiac density suggesting atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 y/o F with a PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia and MR who presents from group home with syncope, found to be in complete heart block now s/p transjugular venous pacemaker placement.
# RHYTHM:  Pt was found to be in new complete heart block which was infranodal, with rates in 20s-30s.
Patient appears to have some underlying conduction disease with baseline RBBB and LAFB as well as some possible LVH in setting of HTN.
Unlikely ischemia causing her presentation as would expect a large RCA infarct to cause this degree of block and this is not evident on EKG and troponins not elevated.
After pacemaker placement patient had runs of atrial fibrillation/flutter and therefore patient was restarted on atenolol and titrated up as patient hypertensive and no longer have to worry about heart rate given pacer.
In addition, given new atrial fibrillation patient was started on coumadin on discharge with goal INR [**2-7**].
There was a question as to whether or not there was a history of chest pain prior to syncope which raises question of ischemia, however EKG here without ischemic changes.
Troponin mildly elevated with flat CK/MB.
Patient is on statin and previously was on a beta blocker which was discontinued due to bradycardia.
# PUMP:  No h/o heart failure.
Echo demonstrated Suboptimal image quality.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No evidence of CHF.
Patient was restarted on atenolol after pacemaker placement in the setting of hypertension and atrial fibrillation/flutter.
No evidence of bleeding.
# UTI: UA in ED shows pyuria, but no leukocyte esterase or nitrates.
Patient denied any dysuria or changes in urination.
Urine culture however was positive for Acinetobacter.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5057**] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 41812**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: complete heart block atrial fibrillation UTI  Secondary: Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Depression Mental retardation   Discharge Condition: afebrile, vital signs stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with syncope (passing out).
You were found to have complete heart block causing a slow heart beat.
You had occasional runs of elevated heart rate.
You were started on a blood thinner called coumadin to decrease your risk of stroke in the setting of your irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation).
Your PCP will contact you regarding further dosing changes for this medication.
You were also started on an antibiotic called Keflex for a new urinary tract infection.
You should return to the ED if you experience any repeated episodes of syncope, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
