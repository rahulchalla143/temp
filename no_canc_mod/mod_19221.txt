Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions remain.
Mild enlargement of the postoperative cardiac silhouette could be due to mediastinal fluid retention, some of which is demonstrated by an air-fluid level seen on the lateral view at the level of the sternal angle.
There is no pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
Echo [**3-12**] MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 0.9 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)  Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 0.9 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.9 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 4.0 cm Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: *0.18 (nl >= 0.29) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% to 55% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: 3.1 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: *3.7 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
