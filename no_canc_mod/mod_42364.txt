Over the past year, the patient had noticed weakness and pain in the right upper extremity while doing her activities of daily living.
Otherwise, her baseline shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion are at baseline.
She does have orthopnea, although without any recent changes.
Coronary artery disease, one vessel disease, total right coronary artery without intervention.
Peripheral vascular disease, aorto vascular bypass.
Renal artery stenosis, status post left renal artery stent.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Peptic ulcer disease with gastrointestinal bleed.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of myocardial infarction at age 70.
Mother died of myocardial infarction at age 61.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The neck reveals no jugular venous distention and no carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, with II/VI systolic ejection murmur of the left upper sternal border.
Pulmonary - bibasilar crackles.
Extremities - no edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
Neurologically, no focal deficit.
She was given intravenous fluid hydration and Mucomyst overnight for the chronic renal failure.
During the procedure, the patient was noted to have in-stent restenosis in the left subclavian and left common carotid arteries.
In addition, there was an old nonhealed spiral dissection of the left subclavian.
The patient's course was complicated by a large right sided groin bleed and hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 70s.
Three days later, the patient was noted to have an enlarging ecchymosis in the right groin and a tense hematoma, 5.0 by 2.0 centimeters.
The procedure was without complications.
However, two days after repair, the patient developed acute onset clear nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting.
An ultrasound was obtained which showed a probable acute cholecystitis.
Abdominal pain resolved within 24 hours.
She is also to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in two to four weeks for scheduled left common carotid artery stent.
In-stent restenosis of the left subclavian and left common carotid arteries, status post stent left subclavian.
