Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light with extraocular movements intact; mucus membranes moist, no erythema or exudates; and icteric.
Neck supple without lymphadenopathy, no bruits.
Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base.
1+ bilateral lower extremity edema and varicosities.
Chest x-ray, findings consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension.
Scattered linear opacities in the lung bases, likely due to subsegmental atelectasis.
Her postoperative course was complicated by sinus arrest with a narrow complex junctional escape rhythm requiring AV pacing.
Urinalysis was suspicious for a urinary tract infection, and she was started on empiric IV Levofloxacin; urine culture subsequently grew out Enterobacter species.
She was transferred to the floor on postoperative day #8, afebrile and AV paced.
Her lung exam at that time was concerning for developing cardiopulmonary process, and chest x-ray was obtained which demonstrated right lower lobe consolidation.
