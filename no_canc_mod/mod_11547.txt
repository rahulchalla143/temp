In [**2178-6-26**], she was admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] with congestive heart failure.
A cardiac catheterization was performed at that time which revealed 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation with a small atrial septal defect, as well as no flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
Since that admission, she has done well symptomatically until recently when she was admitted to [**Hospital3 24768**] again with congestive heart failure and lower extremity edema.
The left atrium was markedly dilated with a left-to-right shunt noted across the intra-atrial septum.
A secundum atrial septal defect was also present.
There was 3+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ aortic insufficiency, and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation at that time.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has a remote history of cigarette smoking (quitting 20 years ago).
ALLERGIES:  The patient had drug allergies to ACCUPRIL and an ANGIOTENSIN MEDICATION (the exact medication unknown).
Cardiology/Electrophysiology Service was consulted for the patient's persistent atrial fibrillation at which time they recommended to continue with beta blocker for now and Coumadin with an INR goal of 2 to 3.
They also stated that they would discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding antiarrhythmic therapy, future cardioversion, and possible future electrophysiology procedures.
In atrial fibrillation.
