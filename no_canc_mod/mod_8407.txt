The patient denied any diarrhea, abdominal pain or sick contacts.
She denied any black or bloody stools, but did complain of a subjective fever but no documented fever.
Her white blood cell count was 21.0 with an elevated lactate of 5.8, elevated glucose of 989, and an anion gap of 47 and bicarbonate of 6.
The patient received six liters of normal saline as well as one gram of Vancomycin, 100 mg of intravenous Gentamicin and was put on an insulin drip for her diabetic ketoacidosis.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient's diabetic ketoacidosis was treated and resolved with intravenous fluids and insulin drip.
The patient was continued on Vancomycin and Gentamicin for question of bacterial endocarditis given her history of intravenous drug abuse.
In the unit, the patient also had an episode of withdrawal where she became acutely agitated and was started on a high dose of Methadone, which was subsequently tapered.
On transfer to the floor, the patient's antibiotics were changed to Clindamycin given her complaints of tooth pain and her poor dentition.
The patient also was complaining of a sore throat and a beta streptococcus culture was obtained.
The patient had negative blood cultures and no further temperature spikes.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Hepatitis C diagnosed two months ago at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital.
Multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
These have all failed since the patient states that she has hyperactivity disorder and self medicates with Heroin to treat this.
Cardiovascular examination - regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs.
No obvious gum abscess or tooth abscess grossly.
Skin - scattered scabs and scratches but no erythema, no rashes, multiple tatoos, pierced nipples and umbilicus.
Urine toxicology screen was positive for opiates, but negative for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, Cocaine, amphetamines and Methadone.
Chest x-ray showed no pneumonia and no congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia at 133 with question of right atrial enlargement, normal intervals, no ST changes.
Diabetic ketoacidosis - As mentioned above, the patient was placed on insulin drip in the unit and her blood sugar improved subsequently.
The patient has very poor understanding of her disease but is willing to learn more about diabetes mellitus management as well as proper nutrition.
The patient had several episodes of nausea and vomiting after transfer to the floor, but this was thought to be secondary to Heroin withdrawal as it is obvious that the patient's Methadone dose had been decreased significantly from transfer from the unit to the floor.
The etiology for the patient's diabetic ketoacidosis is still unclear but it is possible that with the patient's leukocytosis and tooth pain and evidence of poor dentition that she may have a tooth infection.
The patient also complained of significant sore throat and it is possible that she may have had Streptococcus pharyngitis although Streptococcus culture is still pending.
As far as the patient's Methadone taper, the patient has been loaded up with significant doses of Methadone in the Intensive Care Unit secondary to a severe agitation episode.
This dose on transfer to the floor was supposed to be decreased to 40 mg twice a day but due to a nursing error was only given once the next day.
This resulted in significant withdrawal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting and general malaise as well as tremors.
The patient's symptoms ultimately resolved and she was given a brief trial of Clonidine for symptomatic relief at 0.1 mg twice a day.
Acute renal failure - The patient's creatinine was high on admission at 1.5, but improved after intravenous hydration and was back to baseline at 0.5 upon discharge.
for nausea, which alleviated her symptoms somewhat.
The nausea was most likely related to the patient's withdrawal from Heroin and she was treated symptomatically with antiemetics as well as Clonidine.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient at the time of discharge developed a slight contraction alkalosis thought secondary to poor p.o.
The patient has very poor peripheral intravenous access.
Bradycardia - The patient had some episodes of bradycardia with heart rate in the 40s to 60s, which were completely asymptomatic.
The etiology of the patient's bradycardia is still unclear.
