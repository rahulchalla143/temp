No new hemorrhage is identified.
No herniation identified.
Stable chronic microangiopathic small vessel ischemic changes.
Mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss.
CT HEAD post-opeartion: Status post partial evacuation of left subdural collection via left burr holes, with expected postoperative changes and with decreased mass efect on the subjacent left frontoparietal brain and the left lateral ventricles.
Small subdural collection remains, mainly along the superior convexity, where it is isodense.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt is an 88 year-old RH man with a complex PMH including seizures, CAD and afib off coumadin, recent traumatic SDH and very recent admission for transient difficulty producing speech and R hand weakness.
He now presents with a similar episode although the symptoms were more extensive involving right face, arm, and leg hemiparesis and dysarthria.
The duration of symptoms is also longer and he now has a L facial droop.
Given the recurrence of his symptoms for over an hour, seizure is less likely and there was more concern of the mass effect from his SDH hence he was evaluated per neurosurgery.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] performed the left-sided burr hole craniotomy for evacuation of the symptomatic left SDH without complication.
Given his risk factors including CAD and Afib, aspirin 81mg was started the next morning and he remained symptom free including speech and R arm weakness for the remainder of the admission.
He was re-evalauted per PT who recommended returning to rehab for inpatient physical therapy and he is, once again discharged to [**Hospital 5130**] Rehab for acute therapy.
Given mild hyponatremia, his Tegretol has been decreased to 200mg in the morning and 300mg at night.
Patient should have weekly labs and he needs to follow-up with PCP upon discharge from the rehab.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed: Hold for loose stools.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day): Hold for loose stools.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
CT head without contrast prior to seeing Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] (neurosurgery) in 4 weeks   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: L SDH s/p evacuation Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable - Slight R sided weakness including mild facial droop plus occaional difficulty with words.
Discharge Instructions: You returned soon after discharge with another transient episode of slurred speech, R hand weakness in the morning.
Although transient, given the duration of the deficit and its recurrence plus the CT of head showing some mass effect from the subdural hemorrhage, you underwent the evaucation per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2190-2-17**] without complications.
You remained without events since the surgery and your aspirin was restarted the morning after the surgery.
You were continued on your seizure medication, Tegretol and its level was monitored but given the level mildly supratherapeutic, it was decreased to 200mg in the morning and 300mg in the evening.
Please call your doctor or go to the nearest ED if you have worsening weakness or speech problems, new numbness or visual problems, fever and/or unabating headache.
