Admission Date:  [**2150-3-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-4-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-7-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: SAH  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2150-3-28**]: R EVD placement [**2150-3-28**]: Cerebral angiogram with coiling   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 88864**] is a 79 yo Right handed woman who presents with new onset SAH.
This a.m., she informed her husband that she was abruptly feeling warm and soon thereafter became diaphoretic.
After this, she was noted to have some mild weakness of her left arm and to become progressively more somnolent.
Here at the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was noted to have vertical nystagmus at rest.
She became hypertensive to the 210s systolic, so IV nicardipine gtt was started along with nimodipine A stat head CT showed diffuse SAH ([**Doctor Last Name **] III).
HTN on ACE and thiazide 2.
Aneurysmal SAH at 17y/o with "5wks in a coma" but "now it's calcified" and no subsequent Neuro f/u as far as the husband knows 4. other PMH unknown, but husband says no other health problems, and no Neurologic deficits prior to today   Social History: Married, lived in a retirement community with husband; reportedly independent in ADLs.
Discharge: Expired   Pertinent Results: Head CT [**2150-3-28**]: HEAD CT: There is diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage predominantly in the posterior fossa also in the suprasellar cistern and extending predominantly to the right sylvian fissure and interhemispheric fissure as well as convexity sulci.
There is mild ventriculomegaly seen.
There is a rim calcification identified in the prepontine interpeduncular region, which could represent calcified aneurysm.
Head CTA [**2150-3-28**]: CT angiography of the head demonstrates a calcified and thrombosed aneurysm at the basilar artery with possible filling of the small portion of the aneurysm and its medial portion.
Additionally, there appears to be a small aneurysm at the tip of the basilar artery, which may be distinct aneurysm, measuring approximately 3 mm.
Neck CTA [**2150-3-28**]: Negative for vascular anomalies.
Minimal amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.
No hydrocephalus.
Head CT [**2150-4-1**]: IMPRESSION: Status post coiling of right basilar tip aneurysm and left frontal ventriculostomy catheter insertion.
Slight reduction in the size of lateral and third ventricles and stable appearance of the dilated temporal horns.
Redistribution of hemorrhage in the lateral ventricles and third ventricle.
Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, predominantly right-sided, and no evidence of a new hemorrhage in the brain parenchyma.
Head CT/CTA [**2150-4-1**]: The parenchymal hemorrhage and edema, surrounding the left frontal approach shunt catheter, has increased now measuring approx 2.6 x 1.9 cm, previously 1.5 x 1.2 cm.
Mild increase in the blood in both lateral ventricles, with minimal increase in the ventricular size.
CTA read- pending re-cons, but pre-lim negative for further aneurysms.
Brief Hospital Course: 79F who presented with a extensive, diffused SAH.
A CTA was suggestive of possible small aneurysms at the basilar tip (around a previously thrombosed aneurysm) and possibly at the R PCA.
A non contrast head CT was ordered which showed a new left ventricular hemorrhage, we initiated TPA flushes thru her ventriculostomy with little effect.
Her respiratory status remained poor and there was concern for sepsis.
