At that time she had a nucler stress that showed apical ischemia.
Then she re-preseneted to [**Hospital1 1474**], continuing to complain of shortness of breath.
On [**5-8**] she underwent elective cath showing LAD 90% lesion and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for PCI (dye load=116cc).
Cardiac Catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] showed 80-90% lesion in the mid LAD with unsuccessful PCI attempt of the mid LAD despite multiple attempts.

Elevated lv systolic pressure.
No mitral stenosis.
Hyerkinetic LV contractility.
Left main: no sig stonosis LAD: 99% focal mid stenosis after 1st diag branch LCX: mild intimal irreg without sig stenosis RCA: mild intimal irregularities without sig stenosis .
Initial angiography revealed a 80-90% lesion in the mid LAD.The LM coronary artery was normal.
Unsuccessful PCI attempt of the mid LAD despite multiple attempts.
[**2149-5-12**] ECHO PREBYPASS No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
MR remains mild to moderate.
This revealed an 80% stenosed left anterior descending artery which was unamenable to angioplasty or stenting.
As she had a history of atrial fibrillation and poor compliance with coumadin, it was decided a concommittant MAZE procedure would also be performed.
Through further evaluation, she was found to be at her baselne however no conclusion of her decision making ability was made.
She developed rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone.
She was transfused with packed red blood cells for postoperative anemia.
