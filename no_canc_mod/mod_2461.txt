Approximately a year-and-a-half ago she presented with an acute type A aortic dissection.
The patient was coagulopathic and needed to be reopened in the ICU for cardiac tamponade and closed a day later.
The patient did well postoperatively, but developed an aortic root aneurysm with some dehiscence of the proximal suture line and further progression of aortic root dilatation.
In the meantime the patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] over at [**Hospital3 1810**] for workup for possible Marfan syndrome.
The patient does in fact have Marfan syndrome diagnosed by gene analysis.
Past Medical History: - Mechanical MVR [**2153**] (29mm Carbomedics) secondary to myxomatous mitral valve disease and a flail mitral leaflet - Afib/flutter post op s/p successful cardioversion and amiodarone therapy - Type A aortic dissection s/p repair on [**2164-4-2**] complicated by bleeding and afib - Residual Type B aortic dissection from aortic arch down to aortic bifurcation - HTN - Possible Connective Tissue Disease being investigated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital3 1810**] - Seasonal Allergies - DJD with chronic LBP - h/o spontaneous PTX [**2139**] - C section in [**2151**] .
Family History: There is a family h/o valvular disease in her mother (had MVR in [**2159**]).
Brother died of CHF at 47yo.

There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
4.The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
A mobile density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection (old dissection).
Mild to moderate ([**12-18**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Unable to fully evaluate it due to shadowing and poor image quality.
Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of epinephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 14719**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2165-11-18**] for surgical management of her dilated aorta.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Maxim Health  Discharge Diagnosis: Type A dissection with dilated aortic root HTN DJD AI Spontaneous pneumothorax AF in past MVR (Mechanical) [**2153**] Type A Dissection Repair [**3-22**]   Discharge Condition: Good.
