Admission Date:  [**2139-5-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-5-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: chest discomfort  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness: 87 yo male with h/o hypertension, no cardiac history who presented to [**Hospital 487**] hospital with several day history of a "funny" feeling in his chest radiating to the throat.
Patient is not able to describe his symptoms fully but states that he had a strange feeling in his chest, throat fullness/tightness, radiating to left shoulder a/w nausea and diaphoresis.
On the day of presentation he woke up feeling fell and then started having these symptoms again at which point he went to the OSH.
He reports symptoms x 2 week, starting after he had a complete physical by his PCP.
Pt diaphoretic, + nausea and vomitting x1.
Patient arrived to [**Hospital1 18**], cath showing elevated filling pressures, LMCA mild dz, LAD 60-70 mid, LCx 90% mid, occ OM, RCA occluded distally which was stented with Cypher DES with normal residual flow.
Past Medical History: - HTN - gallstones  Social History: Lives alone, has girlfriend and daughter in law who visits frequently.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Abd: Obese and protuberant, soft, nontender throughout, no masses, no pulsatile mass, BS+.
No abdominial bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
The LMCA showed mild 20% stenosis without evidence of flow limitation.
The LCx showed a 90% discrete midsegment stenosis with an occluded OM branch.
The RCA showed a  thrombotic distal segment occlusion.
A large posterolateral branch and also moderate PDA branch were evident after restoration of flow within the RCA.
The right atrial filling pressure was mildly elevated at 11 mmHg with borderline elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 14 mmHg.
The lesion in the distal RCA was predilated with a 2.0 mm balloon, stented with a 3.0 mm Cypher stent and post dilated with a 3.5 mm balloon with lesion reduction to 0%.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection and no embolisation.
Borderline elevated right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures with normal cardiac output.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is an 87 yo M with h/o hypertension, no other cardiac risk factors, who presented with IMI s/p stent to the RCA.
1) CAD: No history of CAD however patient with multivessel disease, s/p intervention on RCA which was likely the culprit lesion.
After cath he had a few transient episodes of atypical chest pain lasting [**11-18**] seconds which resolved spontaneously and were not associated with any EKG changes.
He became CP free with resolution of ST elevations on EKG.
Dr.[**Name (NI) 8664**] office is to call patient with a f/u appointment within the next 2 weeks, and he will consider a stress test ([**6-28**] wks) as an outpatient to better eval the LAD lesion.
3) Pump: Echo as above, EF >55%, has remained euvolemic, with no symptoms of heart failure.
Discussed with patient need to monitor BPs and keep a log for future outpatient management of BP meds.
5) Abdominal discomfort: Recent had a recent diagnosis of gallstones, no fever.
Patient's daughter (physician or RN) was concerned he might have an AAA as patient frequently complains of abdominal discomfort and has history of smoking in the past.
No pulsatile masses were palpated on exam, but exam limited by patient's body habitus.
7) PPX: patient was maintained on a bowel reg prn, and subcutaneous heparin for dvt prophylaxis.

Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good, hemodynamically stable, chest pain free   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of chest pain.
You were found to have had a heart attack.
Given your heart attack and stent, we have placed you on various important medications that must be taken as prescribed.
Please return to the hospital if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea or dizziness, excessive bleeding, or any other symptoms that concern you.
