After this operation, her L arm fractures were addressed in the same setting.
She was also noted to have a T2 fracture for which she was fitted with a SOMA brace.
She had pulmonary congestion and RLL consolidation on CXR which prompted starting levofloxacin on [**2140-9-17**] for pneumonia.
These were changed to vancomycin and cefepime on [**2140-9-19**], after her ventilatory status and fever curve did not improve.
She completed a course of vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia on [**2140-10-5**].
She continued to be ventilator-dependent and was tenuous, oscillating between pulmonary congestion and contraction alkylosis.
On [**2140-10-7**], she again had copious thick respiratory secretions, her WBC was high at 13.2, she was again requiring full ventilatory support and she had a consolidation in the RLL.
She finished this course on [**2140-10-12**] and has remained very well with reassuring respiratory status and CXRs.
