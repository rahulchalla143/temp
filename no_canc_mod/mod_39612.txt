Admission Date:  [**2185-11-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-11-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2166-9-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None this hospitalization   History of Present Illness: This is a 19 year-old Indian with no significant PMH but a recent diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 15%, 2D-Echo [**2185-11-15**]), presenting with acute-onset of shortness of breath for 2-days.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**]-Cardiology service on [**2185-10-17**] when he presented with palpitations, dyspnea, some URI symptoms, which was associated with substernal chest pain, found to have evidence of volume overload and peripheral edema consistent with decompensated dilated cardiomyopathy.
A 2D-Echo was performed and showed 3+ mitral regurgitation with an LVEF of 15-20%.
In terms of cardiomyopathy investigation - his HIV, Lyme antibody, CMV, EBV, hepatitis serologies, TSH and [**Location (un) **] virus testing were all negative.
Of note, the patient has a strong family history of dilated cardiomyopathy, with two uncles who expired in their 30s from heart failure.
He now presented with shortness of breath while at his rehabilitation facility the day prior to admission, [**2185-11-12**], which was occurring at rest and worst with exertion.
This was associated with substernal chest pain that radiated to the right scalp, worse with deep inspiration and relieved by leaning forward.
He has noted no unintentional weight gain, leg swelling.
He also denied fevers or chills, nausea, palpitations and diaphoresis.
He denies URI symptoms or productive cough or abdominal pain.
His exam was notable for tachypnea, tachycardia, but no leg swelling or JVP elevation.
Cardiac U/S in the ED showed no evidence of pericardial effusion, poor squeeze and a dilated left ventricle.
CTA chest showed small, LLL subsegmental pulmonary embolus with possible right lung base PNA.
In the MICU, patient was started on heparin gtt following bolus for small, LLL subsegmental pulmonary embolus.
They continued Vancomycin, Cefepime and Levofloxacin for presumed healthcare-associated pneumonia given CT findings of right lung base consolidation.
He was extubated on [**11-13**] and his heparin gtt was bridged to Coumadin with some mild hemoptysis.
He spiked a temperature to 101.5F, developed tachycardia to the 120s and had a repeat 2D-Echo on [**11-14**] showing right ventricular systolic function that was more severely impaired when compared to the [**10-31**] study.
He developed intermittent abdominal pain with hyperbilirubinemia and a moderate transaminitis concerning for cardiogenic hepatic congestion.
A RUQ ultrasound showed prominent hepatic veins, mild distention of the gallbladder with mild wall thickening and no gallstones.
At this point, his outpatient Cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 401**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**], recommended transfer to the CCU for IV Lasix and Milrinone therapy given his biventricular cardiac failure.
On arrival to CCU, has some nausea and on-going small volume hemoptysis but he is without lightheadedness or dizziness.
He denies chest pain or trouble breathing.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
All of the other review of systems were negative; see HPI for details.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain.
It is notable for dyspnea on exertion, but no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
He did notes some orthopnea, but was without ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.

2D-ECHO ([**2185-10-31**]) - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Mild to moderate ([**12-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mitral regurgitation is now slightly less prominent.
[**2185-10-19**] CARDIAC MR IMAGING - Severely increased left ventricular cavity size with severe global dysfunction.
No CMR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
These findings areconsistent with a nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
Mildly increased right ventricular cavity size and severe global dysfunction.
No thrombus seen in the left ventricular cavity.

[**2185-11-12**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON - Pulmonary emboli within subsegmental branches of the left and right lower lobe pulmonary arteries.
Small right pleural effusion, decreased from prior.
Non-enhancing consolidation in the right lung base which may reflect pneumonia or aspiration in the appropriate clinical circumstance.

Mild distension of the gallbladder along with mild thickening of its wall, no stones identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 19M with no significant PMH presents with likely famlial dilated cardiomyopathy with recent hospitalization for acute failure who responded to diuresis who now returns with shortness of breath found to have pneumonia and subsegmental pulmonary embolus with evidence of biventricular failure and volume overload.
# IDIOPATHIC DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY - The patient presented on [**2185-10-17**] in overt volume overload with evidence of congestive heart failure.
He was noted to have decompensated dilated cardiomyopathy with a 2D-Echo showing 3+ mitral regurgitation with an LVEF of 15-20%.
He responded to aggressive Lasix gtt with conversion to PO Torsemide with improvement in symptoms at that time.
Etiologies for his cardiomyopathy included: ischemic (unlikely given age and no risk factors; no cardiac cath data) vs. infectious (HIV, Lyme, viral, Chagas - last admission his HIV, Lyme antibody, CMV, EBV, hepatitis serologies, TSH and [**Location (un) **] virus testing were all negative) vs. toxic (alcohol, cocaine, medications - unlikely given no prior medication; prior toxicology screens negative, although moderate alcohol intake was noted) vs. familial (most likely possibility given strong family history noted above; genetic vs. autoimmunity-related).
He now returned with dyspnea on exertion and at while at rest without overt volume overload symptoms, but was found to have a subsegmental LLL pulmonary embolus requiring heparinization.
A repeat 2D-Echo ([**11-15**]) showed right ventricular systolic dysfunction that was now more severely impaired.
Overall it appeared to be consistent with right ventricular failure and right atrial dilatation occurring in the setting of subsegmental LLL pulmonary embolus and infection (pneumonia) that had precipitated [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular failure (his admission pro-BNP was 2968).
He also had significant abdominal pain and transaminitis which was attributed to cardiogenic-hepatic congestion or congestive hepatopathy.
We trended his transaminitis and monitored his abdominal pain, which both steadily improved with diuresis.
His ACEI (Lisinopril) and Spironolactone therapy were held in the setting of acute heart failure, but his Metoprolol was titrated back at 12.5 mg by mouth twice daily; we also continued his Digoxin therapy.
# PULMONARY EMBOLUS - The patient was found to have pulmonary embolism in a segmental branch of the left lower lobe of the pulmonary artery - initially presenting with worsening dyspnea.
A 2D-Echo showed right ventricular failure and right atrial dilatation with acute [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular failure; but it is unlikely that a distal, subsegmental PE induced right ventricular failure, but this should be considered.
EKG was without evidence of poor R-wave progression; and he maintained his oxygen saturations.
In light of his recent hospitalization, the risk of thromboembolic disease should be noted.
# HEALTHCARE-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA - The patient presented with right sided chest pain with tachypnea.
He was found to have right lower lobe consolidation on CT imaging.
This was all associated with leukocytosis with a left shift.
The patient was afebrile in the ED.
Nonetheless, he was given IV Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin (started [**11-13**]) for healthcare associated pneumonia coverage.
He did have some evidence of hemoptysis, likely from his infectious alveolar process and anticoagulation needs.
This steadily improved and he remained hemodynamically stable without evidence of large volume bleeding.
He remained afebrile and his leukocytosis improved.
# CORONARIES - He has no evidence of ischemic cardiomyopathy or coronary disease; no prior cardiac catheterizations; no HTN, smoking history or strong atherosclerotic family history (only familial NICM history) - presented with some atypical chest pain symptoms - but now pain free - Troponin < 0.01 x 2-sets with reassuring EKG showing only sinus tachycardia and no ST-changes on admission.
# RHYTHM - No evidence of arrhythmia or history of dysrrhythmia.
The patient is being transferred to [**Hospital6 **] Center for management of his acute biventricular heart failure and will be evaluated by the Cardiac Transplantation Service.
Morphine IV for pain control.
His ACEI and Spironolactone were held while his acute biventricular failure was managed.
