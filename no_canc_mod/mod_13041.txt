Admission Date:  [**2177-3-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-3-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-5-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**] Chief Complaint: back pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Transesophageal echocardiogram   History of Present Illness: M with Crohn's disease recently admitted from [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2177-2-20**] to [**2177-3-2**] with a Crohn's flare c/b cdiff discharged on prednisone, po vanc and po flagyl with good effect who presents with acute bilateral [**9-24**] lower back pain on the morning of presentation.
His back pain radiated to his stomach anteriorly.
No radiation to lower extremities or focal weakness.
He has had back pain since his last admission which has gradually worsened.
He has had difficulty controlling his bowel movements but felt that this was improving.
No change in urinary habits.
Did not report nausea or emesis.
He then became hypotensive to 83/53- his BP on presentation was 180/70 and tachy to 122.
He had one episode of non-bloody, non-bilious emesis.
Of note he had a root canal performed on [**1-31**] for which he was given abx.
****** In the MICU, patient was maintained initially on pressors, volume resuscitated, given stress dose steroids, treated with flagyl/zosyn/vanc, as well as oral vanc.
He was found to have MSSA bacteremia.
CT abdomen showed possible stranding around pancreatic head.
An MRI of the spine without gadolinium was inconclusive and so on day of call-out to floor an MRI with gad was still pending to evaluate for T10 osteomyelitis.
Ileocolonic colitis 2.
Hypertension 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 5.
Recent history of clostridium difficile infection  Social History: The patient is married and has three adult children, one of whom has juvenile onset diabetes.
She had hypertension and myocardial infarction.
The patient has two male siblings, one of whom has hepatitis C requiring a transplant and the other is alive and well.
Physical Exam: VS T 98.8 P 81 BP 146/95 RR 17 O2Sat 95% on RA GENERAL: Pleasant obese male HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus noted Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, decreased bowel sounds, peri-umbilical tenderness with moderate palpation.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
-cerebellar: No nystagmus, dysarthria, intention or action tremor, dysdiadochokinesia noted.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
No evidence of aortic dissection or injury.
Non-specific stranding in the porta hepatis region; this may relate to pancreatitis.
Loss of height in the T10 vertebral body, chronicity indeterminate.
Increased signal intensity in the T9-10 disc with increased signal intensity of the adjacent superior endplate of T10 vertebral body, which could be due to infection, given the clinical history of fever and bacteremia.
If the patient's EGFR is about 30, IV gadolinium contrast can be administered, provided the risks of possible nephrogenic systemic fibrosis are understood by the patient as well as the treating clinical team.
There is also a horseshoe-shaped soft tissue mass under anterior longitudinal ligament at this level, raising the possibility of paraspinal extension of infection anteriorly.
No evidence of epidural space or cord involvement on the present study.
Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine, most prominent at C4-5 and C5-6 with right neural foraminal narrowing.
Moderate left central disc protrusion at L5-S1, impinging left S1 nerve root.
MR W/ AND W/O CONTRAST T-SPINE: INDICATION:  Evaluate T9-10 level for a possibility of discitis and paraspinal abscess.
FINDINGS:  As noted on the prior examination of [**2177-3-16**], there is increased T2 signal within the T9-10 disc as well as increased T2 signal within the superior endplate of T10.
As before, there is slight reduction in the height of the T10 vertebral body.
There is no evidence of enhancement or a paraspinal soft tissue mass.
These findings could be due to a subacute compression fracture of the T10 vertebral body with marrow edema.
There is no retropulsion of bone fragments.
There is no spinal canal stenosis or abnormal spinal cord signal.
There are no areas of abnormal enhancement.
However, mild osteomyelitis and discitis could give a similar appearance, even with the lack of enhancement.
Since the T10-11 disc spaces do not appear brighter than any of the discs inferior to that level, the findings are slightly more consistent with degenerative change with a compression fracture of the T10 vertebral body.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of enhancement or a paraspinal soft tissue mass.
This constellation of findings suggests that the signal abnormalities relate to a subacute T10 compression fracture rather than osteomyelitis and discitis.
A followup exam could be obtained if clinically warranted as the possibility of a discitis and osteomyelitis remains.

Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**6-/2476**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate          days after initiation of therapy.
Hypotension: The patient was found to be hypotensive on presentation and required aggressive fluid infusion and pressors while monitored in the ICU.
Blood cultures were positive for Staph aureus, which was found to be sensitive to oxacillin.
This was investigated with ultrasound and found to be an occlusive thrombus of the cephalic vein.
The thrombophlebitis was thought to be the most likely nidus of infection leading to the staph bacteremia.
However, other sources were sought: a panarex of the jaw revealed no areas suspicious for infection and TTE and TEE revealed no vegetations either as a cause or a result of the bacteremia.
Back pain: The patient described his back pain as [**9-24**] on the day leading up to admission and he continued to experience pain after his transfer out of the ICU.
At no time during his stay did he have a change in his neurologic exam, and he had no bowel/bladder incontinence or saddle parasthesias.
An MR without contrast was scheduled initially, which found increased signal intensity in the T9-10 disc and T10 vertebral superior endplate which were somewhat suspicious for infection, given the patient's presentation.
In addition to the finding of T10 vertebral endplate enhancement, the imaging was most consistent with at subacute compression fracture of the T10 vertebra, likely secondary to degenerative changes.
The orthospine team was consulted and they offered the patient the option of doing a needle biopsy to rule out the chance of infection completely.
However the patient declined, and the ID, ortho-spine, and primary teams were in agreement that the patient could be followed clinically and if he showed worsening signs of infection or back pain, the issue could be readdressed.
If he continues to have back pain, the recommendation for a brace should be readdressed and an [**Hospital **] clinic visit scheduled by his primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 227**] the strong indication of the imaging findings that the patient has had a compression fracture, the patient is likely at risk for repeated compression fractures.
Chronic high dose steroid use is likely a contributing factor.
The patient continued to have intermittent back pain which was particularly exacerbated by certain positions, such as lying flat.
He was discharged on percocet and a limited amount of oral dilaudid for control of the back pain, with instructions to call his physician if his pain was escalating.
Renal failure: While in the ICU the patient had an increase in his creatinine to a peak of 2.4.
This was thought secondary to sepsis and resolved with fluids.
Diarrhea:  The patient tested negative for clostridium difficile on this admission and had no diarrhea.
The thrombocytopenia was thus thought either secondary to sepsis, with appropriate rebound, or secondary to blood collection technique.
The patient did NOT meet diagnostic criteria for HIT on this admission.
Pre-diabetes: The patient had elevated blood sugars during his stay, and steroid use is likely a contributing factor.
Follow-up: Followup with Infectious Disease as described above, with infusion therapy team and weekly labs, with MRI in 4 weeks, and with primary care physician.
