Mr [**Known lastname **] is an ambidextrous man who writes with his left hand with a hitherto unremarkable medical history, who presents with progressive right sided weakness.
However, the symptoms did not improve, and he started to complain of severe back pain, so much so that he resorted to sleeping in a Jacuzzi for 20 mins at a time.
On [**8-23**], his PCP ordered an MRI of the brain which showed a 1.5 cm soft tissue mass in the midbrain and a question of a small acute infarct in the right posterior part of the pons.
Mr [**Known lastname **] then started to develop right sided arm weakness accompanied by numbness two weeks ago, which has become progressively worse.
Last week, his right leg started to become involved in a similar manner.
Last week on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] took his father to CMC [**Location (un) 5450**] [**Name (NI) **], and he had a CT scan of his brain which he was told showed nothing, and the MRI of his entire spine w/o contrast showed a questionable lesion (probable hemangioma) at T7, otherwise there was a minor disc protrusion at T9/10.
He was discharged home, however, he got worse over the weekend, and his son took him into [**Hospital6 204**] yesterday, and they transferred him to the [**Hospital1 **] ER for a stroke evaluation.
At [**Hospital1 189**] he had a CXR which showed atelectasis of the R middle lobe which could be due to a lesion or infection, and his CT head scan had a lot of movement artifact.
ROS: no fevers or chills according to his son, no other neurological or systemic symptoms obtainable from Mr [**Known lastname **] due to his mental status.

Hepatic steatosis.
Splenic low attenuation lesions, not seen before.
These could represent splenic infarcts.
Moderate hiatal hernia.
Abnormal cranial nerve enhancement most likely secondary to the patient's diagnosis of Lyme Disease.
Abnormal signal surrounding the obex at the cervicomedullary junction may also relate to the patient's Lyme disease but is of unclear etiology.

There are low lung volumes.
Bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis have improved on the right and probably increased on the left.
New left lower lobe collapse and volume loss in the left hemithorax in a short time interval is most likely due to mucus plugging.
CXR ([**2102-10-1**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-30**], there is some decrease in the degree of left lower lobe atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] 63 year old male smoker with a past medical history significant for alcohol dependence, esophageal stricture, hypertension and ITP who was admitted on [**9-27**] with a 5-wk history of progressive right-sided weakness (face --> wrist drop --> leg) in the setting of 35# unintentional weight loss in 5 weeks and was found to have a positive serum LYME titer.
Lyme encephalitis: Diagnosed based MRI, CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, positive serum serology with equivocal CSF serology.
He also developed back pain and was given analgesia.
MRI brain was ordered with demonstated a possible pontine acute infarct and midbrain mass.
He then developed R sided progressive arm and leg numbness and weakness as well as confusion at home.
There is also report of previous bulls eye rash.
Patient did have improvement in his neurologic status, but it is unclear which of his deficits are permanent.
Agitation/altered mental status.
Patient had multifactorial delerium thought to be secondary to encephalitis as well as electrolyte abnormalities and med related.
Patient had had some chronic narcotic use, and methadone was started by the SICU team for pain control.
He was also started on Seroquel for agitation which was noted to help.
Patient had hypernatremia on transfer to MICU service and was treated with free water boluses in his PEG feeds, which improved his hypernatremia.
Patient had difficulty weaning off ventilator so had trach and PEG placed [**10-10**].
There was concern for pneumonia based on CXR, however the patient had a BAL and sputum cultures which were both negative for any growth.
The patient was afebrile without elevation in WBC count without treatment.
Patient thought to have difficulty clearing secretions, with significant suctioning of secretions.
Patient was treated throughout his hospitalization with inhaled medications for bronchospasm as there was thought to be a COPD component to his respiratory failure as he had a significant prior smoking history.
Fever: Patient had multiple low grade temperatures throughout the hospitalization.
He has been afebrile since [**10-15**] without any treatment.
The source was thought to be likely Lyme, which was treated with Ceftriaxone.
Abdominal Pain: Patient had an episode of severe abdominal pain on the morning of [**10-26**].
He had also had a bloody bowel movement the evening of [**10-25**], which was attributed to hemerhoids as the blood was surrounding the bowel movement without mixing and was red.
He was seen by surgery, who felt that the patient did not have a surgical abdomen.
He had a PEG tube lavage which was negative for any upper GI bleeding source.
His KUB showed a significant amount of stool, so constipation was thought to be the major source of his pain.
He was maintained on a bowel regimen for stooling and his tube feeds were restarted without evidence of pain.
Hypernatremia thought to be likely iatrogenic as patient was not getting free water flushes with his tube feeds.
Patient was noted to have a corneal ulcer, seen by ophthalmology who performed eyelid suturing on [**10-13**].
Likely related to inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
He was also given bacitracin ointment and artificial tears per ophthalmology, which should be continued until he is seen in 1 week by an outpatient ophthalmologist.
Patient had an episode of an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, and was seen by cardiology.
He was started on Metoprolol and there was no reoccurance of the accelerated idioventricular rhythm.
He has had no periods of hypotension in the past 4 days since these medication changes were made.
Nutrition: Patient is recieving tube feeding via PEG tube for nutrition as well as free water flushes with 300 mL every 4 hours for free water repletion.
12: DVT prophylaxis was given for the course of his hospital stay with subcutaneous heparin.
Patient was full code throughout his hospital stay HCP: son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 84569**]   Medications on Admission: - oxycodone 5/325 mg po q 4-6h prn pain - hydromorphone 2 mg po q4h prn pain - cyclobenzaprine 10 mg po TID prn pain - lorazepam 0.5 mg po q 12h - neurontin 300 mg po tid - hctz 25 mg po daily - theratears - mvi po daily  ALLERGIES: - motrin - GI distress - ativan - paradoxical reaction  Discharge Medications: 1.
