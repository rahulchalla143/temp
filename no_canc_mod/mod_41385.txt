The patient was initially reported to have suffered a seizure this morning, witnessed, occurred while in bed.
She was given ativan 2mg IV with resolution of seizure activity.
She was given 4L of NS and started on dopamine via peripheral line with improvement of SBP to 100s.
The patient had a CXR performed that revealed some evidence of congestion as well as bilateral lower lobe opacities concerning for atelectasis vs. PNA.
The patient does however have by report a history of recurrent UTI as well an kidney stone.
Past Medical History: MS - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10835**] in the past, now followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1774**] in [**Hospital1 1562**] @ [**Telephone/Fax (1) 110728**]; dementia, with frontal dysfunction seizure disorder (prior to recent events, last sz was in [**2154**]) HTN h/o hyponatremia Osteoporosis Gait disturbance Urinary incontinence History of recurrent UTI History of nephrolithiasis s/p R leg fracture s/p bilateral knee replacement   Social History: The patient lives with husband at home and has full-time caregiver x 7 years.
+ oculocephalic reflex.
; No focal wheezes, crackles Cor: Distant heart sounds, RRR< faint I/VI SM at RUSB Abd: Mod distended, obese.
Bowel sounds, hypoactive Rectal: Vault with minimal stool, guaiac negative Ext: Trace LE edema, DP trace bilaterally.
Reflexes 2+ bilaterally in UE, 1+ in lower   Pertinent Results: CT head: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Moderate brain atrophy.
Repeat CT Head: Limited examination with no gross acute intracranial process or significant change since the study obtained 10 hours earlier.
CXR: Bilateral low lung field opacities which could represent atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia.
The remainder of the examination is essentially unchanged with likely bilateral pleural effusions.
Increased density is seen in both lower lung fields, which may indicate some superimposed airspace disease is most marked on the left side.
Bony structures show diffuse osteopenia.
Pelvis Xray: No acute fracture is identified.
Degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine and left hip are observed.
F with MS, seizure d/o, who presented with status epilepticus, found to be subsequently hypotensive with a pneumonia and requiring intubation for airway protectin.
Hypotension - Initial events were ill defined.
She also initially required Levophed for blood pressure support.
There was no evidence of acute bleeding or measurable cardiac shock component.
She also underwent a cortisol stim test which was negative for adrenal insufficiency.
Patient had a central venous line placed to monitor her central venous pressure to a goal of at least 8.
She was broadly pancultured but the cultres failed to reveal a source.
CXR did show a small left retrocardiac opacity that could be interpreted as a pneumonia.
Patient remained normotensive on [**12-10**] for last 5 days without pressors and was transfered to the floor after her arterial line was discontinued.
# Respiratory Failure - Patient was initially intubated for airway protection after the post-ictal state.
She was found to have a left retrocardiac opacity and was subsequently treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn as described above.
Patient was also found to have marked volume overload after the aggressive volume overload.
Patient initially had a very weak cough with moderate secretions.
There was no evidence of recurrent seizures.
The likely trigger was an infection such as the urinary tract infection and the pneumonia.
Hyperglycemia - patient not a known diabetic, maybe secondary to stress but persistent does suggest underlying diabetes mellitus.
There was only mild elevation in her blood sugars without evidence of a hyper-osmolar state or DKA.
Disp:*1 bottle* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Bayada Nursing  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Non-convulsive status-epilepticus Urinary Tract Infection Pneumonia .
The likely trigger was a urinary infection and the pneumonia - both of which have been treated.
If there are any new or concerning signs or symptoms particularly recurrent seizures, fevers to >101F, significant increase in sleepiness, please seek medical attention.
