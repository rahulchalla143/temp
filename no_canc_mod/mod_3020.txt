Patient had extensive blood loss requiring 2 units of PRBCs during the surgery, in addition to FFP.
The patient, however, tolerated the procedure without complications and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition, still intubated.
He was extubated later on post-operative day zero without difficulty.
Post operatively pain was controlled with a PCA with a transition to PO pain meds once tolerating POs.
On Post-operative day 1, patient's mental status deteriorated and patient became increasingly hypotensive despite 2 more units of PRBCs and fluid boluses.
Patient underwent a head CT which showed a stable chronic subdural hematoma.
Repeat Hct showed decline and an abdominal CTA showed patient's pelvic hematoma increased in size with arterial bleeding.
The patient had trouble swallowing with concern for aspiration.
On POD6, patient was re-evaluated by speech and swallow, and again was determined to be of great aspiration risk.
Please see speech and swallow evaluation for further information.
Patient made steady progress with PT.
The incision was clean, dry, and intact without evidence of erythema or drainage; and the extremity was NVI distally throughout.
All questions were answered prior to discharge and the patient expressed readiness for discharge.
