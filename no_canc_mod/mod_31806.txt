# Lip swelling.
No tongue swelling, evidence of laryngeal edema/airway compromise.
Received 1 unit FFP as trial for nonresponsive angioedema (has been effective in case reports of ACEI angioedema but more classically effective - though still only case reports - in hereditary or acquired C1 inhibitor disorders).
Allergy was consulted and recommended multiple complement/C1 and functional studies to rule out acquired C1 inhibitor defiency (still pending at discharge).
Her diet was advanced as tolerated, and she did not complain of any airway swelling or dysphagia.
Patient was eventually discharged home and had marked improvement of her facial swelling.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] stated that medications for which the patient was taking for a period of at least one year were safe to resume, including HCTZ and aspirin, as these drugs caused angioedema through a mechanism that was unrelated to ACEI-related angioedema, the patient's likely diagnosis.
# HTN.
Hypertensive at times to 170s-180s systolic.
This was held as patient has report of a sulfa allergy.
HTN mostly in the setting of discomfort from intubation and responded to sedating medications.
Her home anti-HTN meds were held in the setting of her recent anaphylactic reaction and can be re-started at later date after medication review per her PCP.
ASA held during admission as ASA/NSAIDS have been associated w/ urticaria and angioedema.
#Hypercholesterolemia: PCP reports that patient is on Gemfibrozil, which can also cause angioedema in < 1% of patients.
Pt reports that it is a recent new medication that she started about 1 month ago ([**6-28**]).
Metformin 500 mg po BID ACEI - Lisinopril 40 mg po daily  <--- can cause angioedema Gemfibrozil 600 mg PO BID  <--- can cause angioedema in < 1% of patients ASA 81 mg daily HCTZ 40 mg PO daily <--- should not be used in patients w/ sulfa allergies .
Patient reports that one of these meds (probably either barbs or PCN) caused significant unilateral neck swelling, the other caused perioribital facial rash/blisters.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
EpiPen 0.3 mg/0.3 mL Pen Injector Sig: One (1) as directed Intramuscular as needed as needed for shortness of breath or face/throat edema.
Disp:*2 pens* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Angioedema   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] with a diagnosis of angioedema (lip and facial swelling) due to your Lisinopril use.
Do not eat grapes or dairy products until you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the [**Hospital 9039**] clinic.
We also held your other medications (aspirin/ hydrochlorothiazide/gemfibrozil) during your hospital stay, as all of these medications have been known to cause either angioedema or urticaria (hives).
We were unable to confirm your dose, however, and you should therefore not take this again until you see your primary doctor and have your blood pressure checked, as we started you on a new blood pressure medication (amlodipine).
Please return to the nearest ED or call your primary care physician if you experience any of the following symptoms: Any increased facial swelling or swelling of other parts of your body, extreme difficulty breathing, fever greater than 102, loss of consciousness, difficulty swallowing, light-headedness or dizziness, decreased urine output, new confusion or changes in your thinking or speaking, or any new rapidly spreading rashes.
Also please return if you experience worsening chest pain, abdominal pain, back pain, extremity pain, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
Many of the medications you were on put you at risk for repeated episodes of angioedema.
You were noted to have red blood cells in your urine while here.
However, you should have a followup urine check at your next PCP appointment to make sure that this is not continuing.
