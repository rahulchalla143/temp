Admission Date:  [**2184-1-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-1-19**]   Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**] Chief Complaint: admission prior to percutaneous AVR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2184-1-13**] 1.
Balloon aortic valvuloplasty.
He has been having progressive dyspnea on exertion and can only walk a few steps before having to rest.
He has no anginal symptoms.
He has had worsening leg edema, orthopnea (sleeps in recliner), cough productive of clear sputum.
He reports that his symptoms are currently "much worse" than before his valvuloplasty in [**2181**].
On arrival to the floor, patient is resting comfortably, no SOB, does have CP in L sternum from a fall in the bathroom earlier this week (reproducible, not worse with inspiration, currently [**12-1**] and improved from initial trauma).
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: Critical AS s/p balloon valvuloplasty [**4-29**] NYHA stage IV diastolic CHF CAD s/p CABG [**2167**] (LIMA-D1, SVG-OM1, SVG-RPDA, SVG-1st RPL) Tachy-brady s/p PPM [**4-28**] CKD stage III (baseline Cr 2.2) HTN Pulmonary hypertension Benign prostatic hypertrophy Hypertension GERD History of remote GI bleed Chronic back pain Spinal fusion Appendectomy   Social History: Former pipe smoker.
Family History: There was no family history of premature coronary artery disease.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
NECK: Supple with JVP at angle of jaw, 1x1cm mobile non-tender lymph node in L anterior cervical chain; carotid bruits b/l CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
III/VI systolic murmur peaking early, at RUSB, radiating to carotids.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting edema to knees b/l SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: [**2184-1-14**] Echo: Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Mild to moderate ([**11-23**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen with an anterior perivalvular leak and minimal posterior jet of aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild-moderate perivalvular aortic regurgitation.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Symptoms progressing since valvuloplasty now with severe limitation of function.
Pt admitted for percutaneous AVR.
On hospital day 2, pt had flash pulmonary edema as lasix was held in the am.
# CAD: s/p CABG in [**2167**], has stable coronary artery and graft disease on cath in [**10-30**] (prox Cx 100% stenosis, prox RCA 100% stenosis, all grafts widely patent.
Pt's EKG's were unchanged, and pt had no chest pain during the admission.
# Acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction due to aortic stenosis: Last EF 55-60% ([**2182**]).
Pt is currently in stage IV diastolic CHF with severe limitation of function.
Pt presented with fluid overload on exam and by CXR.
# Tachy-brady s/p PPM [**4-28**]: EP evaluation and interrogation of ICD/PPM to determnine whether it needs to be suppressed during the valve procedure, which will involve rapid right ventricular pacing (up to 200 bpm) during balloon valvuloplasty and 110 BPM during valve placement.
# Stage III CKD: Baseline Cr 2.2.
# HTN: Well-controlled on admission, with brief hypertension in setting of flash pulmonary edema.
# BPH: Continued doxazosin.
Brief CCU course: Patient was transferred to the CCU on a non-rebreather in severe respiratory distress and impending respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema, confirmed by chest xray imaging.
His foley catheter became displaced during transfer necessitating removal and replacement with coude catheter with subsequent mild hematuria.
Balloon aortic valvuloplasty.
He did develop hematuria and urology was consulted.
Continuous bladder irrigation was initiated.
He failed a void trial and he will be discharged home with a Foley Catheter.
By the time of discharge on post-procedure day 6, the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
