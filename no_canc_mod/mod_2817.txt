Edema and enhancement of the subcutaneous soft tissues, consistent with cellulitis.
Chest X-Ray on [**4-4**]: Normal  Echo on [**2137-4-6**]: No pericardial effusion.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Blood culture from [**4-4**]: no growth, subsequent blood cultures pending  Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo M with h/o DM1 with previous h/o of toe amputations and CAD presents with foot pain and ulcer:  # Hypotension/Fever/Tachycardia: Pt originally presented to [**Hospital **] hospital after several days of fever w/pain and drainage of right foot, had a WBC of 17.9, was given Oxacillin snd Vancomycin, and transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] that day.
He was afebrile and normotensive on admission.
On [**4-4**] he spiked fevers and dropped bp and antibiotics were switched to Zosyn and continued on Vancomycin.
He was also put on CLindamycin for potential necrotizing fascitis given pt's pain was out of proportion to the exam.
He was transferred to MICU for persistently low BPs on [**4-5**], had a R IJ placed and was on pressor support for approximately 5 hours before being weaned.
Since nec fasciitis was unlikely given clinical appearance, and MRI revealed cellulitis, not osteomyelitis, his WBC was in NL range, and his eosinophil count was elevated, it was felt that autonomic decompensation and fever might be a drug reaction rather than sepsis.
Patient has been afebrile and normotensive > 72 hours at discharge.
# Foot ulcer: Based on h/o diabetes and prior positive cultures, thought to be multimicrobial.
No wound culture sent.
Pain was out of preportion to exam, originally concerning for Nec Fasc although there was a likely neuropathic component.
See above for antibiotic regimen.
First three medication changes for broadening of coverage, the change on [**4-7**] due to continued fever and concern that these fevers may have been drug related, particularly concerning given a modest eosinophilia on blood diff.
Foot CT without evidence of osteomyelitis or abscess, and MRI of foot revealed cellulitis, with no evidence of ostemyelitis or abscess.
At discharge his cellulitis had completely resolved without fluctulance, warmth or drainage from the original site.
On [**4-8**] [**Name8 (MD) **] NP helped pt transfer back to the pump and came back on [**4-9**] to modify parameters because of persistent hyperglycemia.
Pt will get [**Last Name (un) **] follow-up if he continues to have high blood sugars at home.
# Depression/?Bipolar: [**Hospital 18**] medical records only confirm diagnosis of depression, however pt was continued on outpt regimen of effexor, haldol, lithium and clonazepam for pressumed bipolar disease.
# CAD: Per report h/o multiple MIs.
Pt denied chest pain throughout admission.
# Lower extremity rash:  Nontender peticheal/purpuritic rash of anterior aspect of both lower extremities as well as erythemetous lesions of his left hand were originally speculated to be part of the stigmata of endocarditis.
Medications on Admission: 1) Clonazepam 1mg [**Hospital1 **] 2) Plavix 75mg daily 3) Lisinopril 20mg PO daily 4) Lithium Carbonate 300mg TID 5) Metoclopramide 10mg [**Hospital1 **] 6) Metoprolol XL 25mg PO daily 7) Propoxyphene N-acetaminophen 100-650mg PO BID 8) Zocor 20mg PO daily 9) Effexor XR 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **] 10) ASA 81mg daily 11) Omeprazole 40mg PO daily 12) Haldol 1mg daily 13) Insulin pump (long acting plus short)  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Foot Cellulitis Sepsis  Secondary: DM I CAD   Discharge Condition: At discharge, the patient was hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and with appropriate follow up.
You were briefly in the ICU because of low blood pressure.
Infectious disease doctors looked at your rash and decided it was most likely a result of your allergy to an antibiotic you took several days ago.
It is important that you tell future providers that you may have a severe allergy to certain antibiotics such as vancomycin, Zosyn and Unasyn.
Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at the [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetes management.
