History of Present Illness: HPI (from medicine admit note as patient not currently giving history): This is a 20 yo F w/ PMH migraine and ADHD who presents from OSH with 6 days of HA, nausea, vomiting and fever as well as diagnosis of meningitis by lumbar puncture.

Per patient's mother, she developed a HA with associated nausea and vomiting on 6 days ago and developed an additional fever 3 days ago.
Per OSH report, lumbar puncture was performed on [**2166-10-21**] and she was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone empiracally for coverage against bacterial meningitis.
Gram stain was negative and CSF culture has also shown no growth.
Tox screen positive for opiates and cannabinoids, with patient receiving morphine and percocet for pain control.
Her hospital course was notable for onset of delirium last night and she required a code purple.
The wet read showed diffuse edema involving the right temporal, frontal, parietal and left frontal cortices.
The ddx is a vasculitic or encephalitic / cerbritis process.
Per OSH record no recent travel, toxin exposure, or rashes.
She has a cat but no other pets.
Her symptoms preceded a viral illness her father had.

EOMI intact without nystagmus as above.
Disconjugate gaze with down and out deviation of the right eye noted when opening the eyelids to check pupillary reaction to light, with recovery of conjugation when focusing eyes.
Right much greater than left predominantly temporal lobe FLAIR hyperintensity, mild cortical enhancement, and restricted diffusion raising concern for HSV encephalitis.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
EEG [**10-24**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing and suppression, without clear reactivity to pain, suggestive of a severe encephalopathy.
Infection, medications, and toxic/metabolic disturbances are among the most frequent causes.
Although some sharp features were seen in the right hemisphere, no overt epileptiform discharges were seen during this recording.
Interval worsening of the edema involving right temporal, frontoparietal and left frontal lobes, with worsening mass effect.
Interval development of small hemorrhage in the right sylvian fissure.
No electrographic seizures were noted.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hospital Course:       [**Doctor First Name **] is a 20 yo female with a history significant for migraine headaches who presented to the hospital with 6 days of headache, nausea, vomiting, and fevers.
Initial consideration was for meningitis, and a lumbar puncture was done which revealed clear CSF and a lymphocyte predominant CSF (with normal glucose and elevated protein), with a negative gram stain and bacterial cultures.
When she began to develop worsening mental status changes, consideration for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] was initiated.
She had a head MRI on the night of admission, which was read as "Right much greater than left predominantly temporal lobe FLAIR hyperintensity, mild cortical enhancement, and restricted diffusion raising concern for HSV encephalitis."
Because of the concern of edema in the setting of mental status changes, she was transferred to the medical intensive care unit.
Given that the original MRI was consistent with HSV encephalitis, this was the working diagnosis.
A repeat head CT was done several hours later that showed uncal herniation.
Neurosurgery was called, and felt that there was no intervention that would reverse this process.
She made no spontaneous respiratory efforts, and she expired peacefully shortly thereafter.
