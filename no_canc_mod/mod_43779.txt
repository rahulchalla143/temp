No evidence of pancreatic necrosis.
Tiny fluid collection anterior to the pancreatic body could represent a tiny pancreatic pseudocyst.

Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.

Hypodense lesion in left lobe of the liver is too small to accurately characterize.
Right renal cyst   Brief Hospital Course: 78yo [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] who after eating seafood at his home the night prior to admission, had an acute onset of sharp/stabbing, non-radiating epigastric pain associated with nausea and vomiting approximately six hours after eating.
Patient was admitted on [**2189-9-20**] and RUQ US showed cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Patient did have one episode of desaturation to 88% that responded to oxygen administration.
With improved, but continued abdominal pain, patient had CT A/P performed that showed radiographic evidence of pancreatitis and cholethiasis but not cholecystitis.
For fear of continued pulmonary complications as a result of pancreatitis, the patient was transferred to the ICU for observation and CVL placement for CVP monitoring.
Aggressive hydration was performed and GI was consulted for severe [**Last Name (un) 5063**] criteria (age, WBC, pO2, serum Ca, and Hct) for possible ERCP but it was discouraged after patient normalized his LFT's and was shown to have non-dilated biliary ducts on CT.  A bit of lasix in the ICU improved his respiratory system, with improvement in bilateral pleural effusions.
Patient did have episode of altered personality following administration of ativan in the ICU, with improper statements and actions directed at the nurses, requiring patient's four point leather/soft restraints.
Once stabilized, the patient was still in need of elective cholecystectomy; because of his respiratory complications and cardiac history, operative clearance was sought.
