Secretions within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the bilateral lower lobes and associated partial left lower lobe collapse with areas of relative hypodensity.

Status post open reduction internal fixation of a comminuted left intertrochanteric femur fracture which secured in good anatomic alignment.
Surgical hardware intact with no evidence for hardware failure.

Films showed comminuted intertrochanteric fracture.
On POD #2, became suddenly hypoxic - CTA showed subsegmental Pulmonary embolism and left pneumonia.
Patient was started on heparin gtt, levoflox, flagyl initially for aspiration pneumonia and transferred to MICU.
Medical ICU course- Patient sent to ICU due to increased oxygen requirement.
Given recent intubation and hospital stay of 48 hours, antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin/cefepime.
Echo showed no right heart strain.
Hypoxemia was felt to be more likely from pneumonia than pulmonary embolism given subsegmental nature of them.
She will need to complete at least a 3 month course of coumadin for treatment of her pulmonary emoblism.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 112496**] [**Name (STitle) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 112497**]) of [**Male First Name (un) 17703**] NJ was personally contact[**Name (NI) **] by the inpatient team to notify the patient of her need for coumadin for treatment of pulmonary embolism and to make him aware that the patient will need her next INR check on [**Name (NI) 766**], [**2133-11-9**].
Orthopaedics evaluated the patient on day of discharge and evaluated films of the left hip; radiology noted that the fracture and hardware were unremarkable.
Patient's hypertension was controlled with atenolol and amlodipine through her floor course.
Docusate Sodium (Liquid) 100 mg PO BID   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Rehab in NJ  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Left intertrochanteric femur fracture, HCAP, pulmonary embolism, diabetes mellitus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
While you were recovering, you unfortunately developed a pneumonia and blood clots in your lungs.
You are also being discharged home on new pain medications- oxycodone and acetaminophen (tylenol)- to be taken as needed.
