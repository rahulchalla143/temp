Admission Date:  [**2125-9-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-10-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-9-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ibuprofen / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7934**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: 57yo M w/ PMH of poorly controlled DM type II, cirrhosis, HCV, HTN, and a h/o TB who presents with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation in the ER.
He presented to the ER on [**9-26**] with SOB x 1 week that became progressively worse, culminating in CP on deep inspiration.
[**Name (NI) 947**] Pt is s/p banding s/p TIPS after massive GI bleed in [**2119**] and [**2122**].
HTN 7.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus 9.
Mild PTSD.
Sisters x 2, both with HTN and one with a heart murmur   Physical Exam: VS - T 99.6, BP 121/67, HR 85, RR 26, sats 93% AC 600x15, FiO2 100%, PEEP 8 I/O: 4000/220 Gen: WDWN AfAm male, sedated and intubated, on vent.
Sclera anicteric, mildly edematous.
OP clear, no thrush, no erythema or exudate.
Lungs: Coarse breath sounds throughout, but no crackles/wheezes.
No appreciable HSM.
Agitated saline contrast study suggests the presence of an intracardiac shunt (probably stretched patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Interval worsening of airspace consolidation and mild ground glass changes with prominent consolidation at the bases bilaterally.
The differential includes ARDS and multifocal pneumonia.
Development of mediastinal air most likely secondary to barotrauma related to ventilation.
Shaggy irregular wall thickening of descending and sigmoid colon.
Cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis.
[**10-17**] CXR: Widespread pulmonary consolidation predominantly bibasilar has worsened appreciably between [**10-13**] and [**10-16**].
Worsening opacification since [**10-16**] probably represents an overlay of mild pulmonary edema.
There may be small bilateral pleural effusion as well.
No pneumothorax.
2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE/ARDS: Patient presented with fluminant bilateral patchy pneumonia and intubated in the ED.
3) PNEUMONIA: Initially thought of as CAP/hospital acquired/asp and treated with azithro/ceftaz/vanco/flagyl changed to zosyn/flagyl/vanco.
Then grew GNR in sputum and thought to have VAP and started on meropenum.
Pt now growing yeast in blood cultures, may also be the cause of his pneumonia.
4) HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Had two discrete episodes of hypotension in conjunction with episodes of sepsis.
5) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Patient had 2 episodes of ARF that both resolved in setting of underperfusion and sepsis.
6) ANEMIA: Has a chronic anemia, but baseline is usually low to mid 30's.
7) THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Likely due to splenic sequestration/splenomegaly from his cirrhosis.
Also a chronic problem, with baseline plts in the 80-100 range.
8) COAGULOPATHY: Pt has poor synthetic liver function and he was given FFP for procedures.
9) DM TYPE II: He was treated with Insulin drip, NPH and RISS as needed throughout hospitalization.
10) HEP C/CIRRHOSIS: Had h/o hep C genotype Ib, but not on treatment.
At times was on propranolol for esophageal varices.
Pantoprazole given for esophageal varices.
11) elevated pancreatic enzymes: occured late during hospitalization.
No pain associated.
12) HTN: Had history of htn at home occasionally required hydralazine.
