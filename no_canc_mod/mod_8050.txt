Family History: No family history of CAD or DM.
HEENT: Slight conjunctival pallor.
Slightly dry mucous membranes.
No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Slight 4/6 systolic murmur in apex and left lower sternal border.
No rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**] appreciated.
No wheezes or rhonci appreciated.
Nontender and nondistended.
No guarding or rebound.
No splenomegaly appreciated.
No clubbing or cyanosis.
2+ dorsalis pedis and radial pulses, bilaterally.
SKIN: No rashes, ulcers, petechiae, or pigmented lesions.
No ecchymoses.
Could not appreciate any ST segment elevations.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior akinesis.
[Intrinsic left  ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue synchronization imaging demonstrates no significant left ventricular dyssynchrony.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction (regional) without significant left ventricular dyssynchrony.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
[**2194-12-9**] Vein mapping: IMPRESSION: Patent bilateral subclavian veins and bilateral brachial arteries.
[**2194-12-9**] ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D  or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal to mid inferior wall.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small circumferential (0.6 cm) pericardial effusion.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated mean PCPW of 15mmHg.
[**2194-12-12**] Carotid artery u/s: IMPRESSION: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 66 year old woman with CAD, status post MI in [**2186**] and [**2191**], moderate MR, EF 35%, and CHF who was hospitalized in [**Month (only) **] [**2193**] for CHF exacerbation, who presented for a scheduled appointment today and was noted to have increased shortness of breath over the past two weeks.
Admitted for fluid management of CHF and potential MVR and/or ICD.
#) CHF: The patient was noted to have an EF of 35% on [**2194-12-3**], in setting of moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] has had increasing shortness of breath in the past several weeks.
She denies any chest pain or palpitations.
She denies any noncompliance with her diet as an outpatient and denies any recent weight gain or increased lower extremity swelling.
She had preop labs drawn and carotid U/S which showed bilateral less than 40% stenosis.
#) CAD:  known CAD s/p MI in [**2186**] and [**2191**].
She had no active ischemia during this admission.
#) rhythm: maintained on telemetry with occassional PVCs.
#) Diabetes TypeII: Continued humalog 50-50 at home doses, but hold glipizide, due to renal insufficiency.
#) Acute on chronic renal failure: Appears that patient's creatinine function 3.0 on last admission and her baseline is about 2-2.5, which is most likely the result of longstanding diabetes and hypertension.
A renal u/s was performed which showed no hydronephrosis.
Most likely due to anemia of chronic disease with iron deficiency and CRI as causes.
She was guiac negative here, but should have an outpatient colonoscopy as she says she has never had one before.
#)  Endocrine:  She had marked elevated of calcium on admission (11.8).
Her calcium quickly returned to [**Location 213**] limits and it was thought to have been elevated secondary to exogenous replacement she was taking (4 pills a day).
Disp:*90 Tablet, Chewable(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Congestive heart failure- left ventricular systolic dysfunction with EF ~35%, +3-4MR end-stage-renal disease Mitral regurgitation   Discharge Condition: good, AFVSS, SaO2 100% on room air   Discharge Instructions: Please take all of the medications prescribed for you.
You were admitted with congestive heart failure; to treat this you will need to limit your salt intake to 2g daily, limit your fluid intake to 1.5L/day and you should weigh yourself daily.
If you gain > 2 lbs or if you have difficulty breathing you should contact your PCP or cardiologist who may want to increase your lasix dose.
You should seek medical attention if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, gain >2lbs, are light-headed or pass out, or for any other concerns.
You were also admitted because of your worsening kidney function.
We are also starting you on epogen shots for your anemia which is associated with your kidney disease .
