Gestation dates by IVF; known di-di twin females.
This pregnancy was reported as uncomplicated until pre-term SROM on the morning of admission.
Antibody positive for anti-E, rubella immune, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, GBS unknown, RPR nonreactive, history of HSV but no active lesions.
Mother admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on the day of admission with pre-term contractions.
No grunting or panting in the delivery room.
GENERAL:  34 2/7 weeks GA female with increased work of breathing.
CPAP sounds bilateral breath sounds.

ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender, nondistended.
No cleft lip or palate.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Rate and rhythm regular, normal first and second heart sounds with no murmur.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory System: Due to increased work of breathing and initial posterior retractions and chest x-ray consistent with RDS, she was started on nasal CPAP and continued to require high oxygen requirement and then was electively intubated and was given a dose of surfactant (beractant).
She received another dose of surfactant six hours after the first does due to high pressure requirements on the ventilator and high oxygen requirement.
She did not have any apnea or bradycardia episodes during her hospital course.
Cardiovascular: She remained hemodynamically stable with no murmur and normal perfusion.
The mother was noted to have Anti E positive antibodies but the baby's antigen E status is negative.
Neurologic: Given the gestational age of greater than 32 weeks and no significant neurologic examination findings, she does not qualify for a screening head ultrasound examination.
Ophthalmology: Gestation more than 32 weeks with minimum oxygen requirement.
Does not qualify for ROP examination.
