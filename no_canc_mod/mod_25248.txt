She has chronic atrial fibrillation and required placement of permanent pacemaker in [**2119**].
Transesophageal echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] [**2120**] confirmed severe mitral regurgitation.
Given significant mitral regurgitation and congestive heart failure symptoms, she has been referred for redo mitral valve surgery.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.
The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA were all without any significant coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right-sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 15 mmHg.
Left-sided filling pressures were also moderately elevated with a PCWP of 22 mmHg.
Pulmonary artery pressures were moderately elevated with a PAS pressure of 55 mmHg.
There was borderline systemic systolic arterial hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 140/57, mean 88 mmHg.
No significant calcification of the thoracic aorta.
Large right non-hemorrhagic pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.
Small left non-hemorrhagic pleural effusion.
5-mm left apical nodule (4:32) should be followed-up with CT in 12 months if patient does not have a history of smoking or malignancy.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is a coronary sinus which appears dilated at > 1.5 cm.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2).
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild to moderate ([**1-5**]+) tricuspid regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function.
Moderate TR and mild AI.
No other change.
On [**10-1**] she underwent a cardiac cath which revealed no coronary artery disease.
Coumadin was restarted for chronic atrial fibrillation and titrated for goal INR.
She remained slightly anemic post-op with discharge HCT of 28.6. she worked with physical therapy during her post-op course for strength and mobility.
