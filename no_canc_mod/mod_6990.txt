Ms [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 28792**] had elevated blood pressures (140-160/80-94) as well as a headache while in triage.
Preeclampsia labs were normal, with the exception of the elevated creatinine (4.3), which was consistent with her baseline.
Although her blood pressures were elevated and there was a concern for preeclampsia, it was a difficult diagnosis to make since she was anuric.
If she became hypotensive during dialysis, which is common, the concern is fetal well-being.
But on the other hand, if hypertensive, the concern is maternal stroke.
She was given an additional dose of Lopressor (50mg) with no improvement, BPs remained elevated at 200s/117-120.
After discussions with the renal team and anesthesia, the decision was made to proceed with delivery for severe preeclampsia, based on blood pressures.
She was taken to the operating room and underwent a repeat low transverse cesarean section and bilateral tubal ligation under general anesthesia.
Pain controlled with Dilaudid.
Pt complained of shortness of breath, lungs had crackles had the bases, and her oxygen saturation was 92% on 4 liters of oxygen.
It was felt that she had fluid overload and the plan was to dialyze, which was peformed shortly after.
Her blood pressures remained elevated during hemodialysis, 160-170/90-111.
Her oxygen saturation was 92-94% on 5 liters of oxygen, and she had decreased lung sounds at the bases.
She was given Nifedipine for her elevated blood pressures.
CXR findings were consistent with pulmonary edema.
HD#4/POD#2 Hemodialysis was repeated in the morning due to persistent shortness of breath.
Blood pressures still elevated and oxygen saturation 93% on 5 liters of oxygen.
Approximately 3 liters of fluid was removed after hemodialysis and her symptoms had improved.
Preeclampsia labs were stable with the exception of a slight drop in platelets to 126.
A bedside echo revealed no significant change from a prior study and her EKG was unchanged as well, normal sinus rhythm.
Repeat CXR showed severe pulmonary edema.
The decision was made to transfer her to the ICU for management of her pulmonary edema and hypertension.
Hemodialysis performed.
HD#5/POD#3 Clinically improved.
