The patient is a 53 y/o F with a PMH of fibromyalgia and hypertension presenting with chest discomfort, shortness of breath and hypotension.
The patient reports that she began to feel increasingly unwell yesterday when she noted increased fatigue and did not leave her home.
Today she noted dyspnea and dizziness while walking with her daughter.
She had to stop frequently to catch her breath while walking home and had difficulty ambulating up stairs.
She also reports difficulty swallowing secondary to throat tightness, with dysphagia to hard solid foods for one month.
She has had symptoms like this before, last time one week ago.
She sleeps on four pillows nightly due to difficulty breathing.
On arrival to the ED she complaints of [**10-24**] chest pain with associated diaphoresis and shortness of breath.
On arrival to ED, ECG was not felt to be consistent with acute ischemia.
She underwent a FAST scan which was negative for pericardial effusion.
CTA negative for PE or dissection.
She was given 2L NS without response in BP.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient complains of continued discomfort in her chest and throat.
Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.
Hypertension Lumbosacral radiculopathy.
Family History: Mother died with liver disease.
Father died at 45 with a heart attack.
One brother died with renal failure.
CV: RRR, nl s1/s2, no MRG, palpable, reproducible tenderness along sternum, pulses palp 2+ radial, PT/DP RESP: CTAB, no WRR ABD: soft, NT/ND, NABS.
Tendeness at epigastrium.
EXT: no edema .
PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISCHARGE: Vitals: T 97.9, BP 138/86, RR 18, pulse 77, O2 97%RA GEN: alert, oriented X3, NAD HEENT: MMM CV: RRR, nl s1/s2, no MRG, pulses palp 2+ radial, PT/DP RESP: CTAB, no WRR ABD: soft, NT/ND, NABS EXT: no edema   Pertinent Results: LABORATORY RESULTS: .
[**2150-9-8**] 2:20 pm URINE CULTURE (Final [**2150-9-9**]): NO GROWTH.
ST-T wave configuration suggests early repolarization pattern but clinical correlation is suggested.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2150-4-29**] no significant change.
ST-T wave configuration suggests early repolarization pattern but clinical correlation is suggested.
Compared to the previous tracing of same date no significant change.

Compared to the previous tracing of same date no significant change.
CXR [**2150-9-8**]: IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
There is no definite acute displaced fracture.
No definite pulmonary embolism within the main, primary, lobar or large segmental branches of the pulmonary artery.
CT HEAD [**2150-9-8**]: IMPRESSION: No definite acute intracranial abnormality.
No aspiration into the airway.
Prominent cricopharyngeus impression with free passage of a barium tablet.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 y/o F with a PMH of fibromyalgia and hypertension presenting with chest discomfort, shortness of breath, admitted for hypotension.
# HYPOTENSION: SBP 106 at ED triage, dropped to 80s after nitro SL, and stable in 100-110s after 3L IVF.
Initial concern for ACS, aortic dissection, or PE, but CE negative and stable, ECG unchanged from prior, and CTA negative.
Arm pain could represent atypical CP, but likely MSK/fibromyalgia since it is exacerbated with movement and consistent with past arm pain.
Volume depletion is possible but pt does not seem overtly volume down on exam or labs.
Some improvement in ED with 2.6L of IVF but little change with final 500cc in MICU followed by autodiuresis, which indicates adequate fluid status but persistent relative hypotension.
Minimal evidence of significant infection-- no fever, tachycardia.
WBC down and lymphocytosis on [**9-9**], so viral infection is possible.
However, vasodilation due to infection is unlikely since she does not meet SIRS criteria aside from WBC.
Abx held give lack of evidence of infection.
Blood loss possible given GERD symptoms and Hct down from 39.1 on [**6-23**] from 39.1 to 33 at admission and to 30.7 on [**9-9**].
Thus, GI bleed in setting of gastritis is possible, but she denies changes to bowel movement, guaiac was negative,and Hct has stabilized.
Adrenal insufficiency is possible given hypotension and borderline low sodium.
Pt then became hypertensive and her metoprolol was restarted at low dose and pt monitored.
# Chest Discomfort: Likely due to GERD given ascending retrosternal burn, throat pain/tightness c/w prior experiences with GERD.
+/-MSK or costochondritis, especially given arm pain this AM.
A pharmacologic sestamibi stress test or similar CVD work up may be warranted given recent increase in health care visits/hospitalizations associated with chest pain.
Significant anxiety given loss of job could exacerbate chest pain and cause sensation of SOB, throat tightness, weakness.
Dysphagia to hard solids with history of GERD is suspicious for esophageal stricture/adhesion or esophageal spasm.
Barium swallow was performed showing no obstruction or esophageal pathology.
No clinical signs of poor perfusion, Cr stable.
However, history of GERD could be associated with GI bleed in the setting of gastritis, although guaiac was negative and she denies changes to BM per above.
# ANXIETY/DEPRESSION: Worse in past 6 months following loss of her job, with worsening insomnia, headaches and anxious mood (per daughter, patient does not endorse) in the last month.
No outpatient anxiolytics.
