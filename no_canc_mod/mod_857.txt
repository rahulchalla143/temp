Initially presented with flu-like symptoms and a subjective fever for about one week.
In the ED there, CXR showed baseline interstitial pattern and possible right basilar infiltrate.
TTE and OSH showed an EF of 50% without valvular lesions.
She has also had bad joint pain during her hospitalization.
CT chest showed diffuse airspace disease, bilateral reticular changes of uncertain etiology, with the differential including infection, edema and fibrosis.
Leflunomide toxicity was also raised as a possible etiology, but level is pending and it is unclear when it will come back.

# Hypoxia: Thought to be multifactorial with contributions from an infectious process, pulmonary hemorrhage in the setting of a supra-therapeutic INR, and volume overload.
CXR showed diffuse puffy infiltrate b/l most consistent with ARDS.
On bronchoscopy, blood was visualized, consistent with pulmonary hemorrhage.
Workup for vasculitis including ANCA and anti-GBM were negative.
Immediately following extubation it was noted that she had some stridor, but appeared comfortable.
Upon chin-lift maneuver, the stridor disappeared, suggesting a supra-glottic cause.
She continued on diuresis with lasix as needed for volume overload.
# NSTEMI: On [**11-15**], she experienced chest pain and troponin leak.
She did not have EKG changes consistent with ischemia.
# Fever: Reportedly she had persistent fever while in OSH.
However, she was afebrile during her stay at [**Hospital1 18**].
Differential included infectious source such as pneumonia or cellulitis vs. inflammatory secondary to rheumatoid arthritis.
She was treated as above for pneumonia, and her fever curve was trended.
# RLE Cellulitis: Improved with antibiotics and supportive care.
# HSV infection: positive culture from oral swab.
Ophthalmology consult was obtained with no sign of HSV keratitis.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Resolved with IVF rehydration in OSH.
# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Per discussion with cardiology, the decision was made to not restart her coumadin in the setting of pulmonary hemrrohage.
Likely contributions from anemia of chronic disease and acute hemorrhage.
#) Nutrition: poor nutrition due to painful oral ulcers and poor denture.
Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO BID:PRN  pain 2.
Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO BID:PRN  pain 2.

You were admitted to the hospital because of a very bad infection and bleeding in your lungs that required you to be intubated.
Your infection was treated with antibiotics and your warfarin was held due to the bleeding in your lungs.
You also have a viral infection around your mouth causing sores.
You also have an infection in your right leg that is being treated with an antibiotic (vancomycin).
