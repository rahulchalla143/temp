Results follow:  ORAL PHASE: Bolus formation and bolus control were moderately impaired with significantly prolonged mastication and oral residue after a [**12-29**] of a ground cookie.
Pt was also noted to have premature spillover with both thin liquids to the level of the pyriform sinuses and to the valleculae with nectar thick liquids.
Pt had a moderate amount of oral residue after all consistencies tried.
No nasal regurgitation was appreciated during this study, but velar elevation was still mildly reduced.
Laryngeal elevation was mildly reduced with reduced base of tongue retraction, resulting in moderate amount of residue in the valleculae (solids > liquids), although slightly improved since the last study.
Pt did have less residue in the pyriform sinuses with only a trace amount noted during today's study.
Pt also had decreased laryngeal valve closure, with one episode of premature opening of the vestibule and vocal cords resulting in aspiration.
Pt was also noted to have absent epiglottic deflection.
Pharyngeal transit time was mildly reduced with moderately impaired bolus propulsion.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Pt had penetration of both thin and nectar thick liquids before and during the swallow from premature spillover.
Pt had one episode of penetration before the swallow with a tsp of thin liquid.
Pt also had trace to mild amounts of aspiration with both thin and nectar thick liquids during and after the swallow.
Aspiration during the swallow was secondary to premature spilover and uncle[**Name (NI) **] penetration as well as decreased laryngeal valve closure with the pt opening the vestibule and vocal cords prior to the completion of the swallow.
While pt did have throat clearing and occasional spontaneous coughing during the study, it was not correlated to aspiration r penetration.
All episodes of aspiration and penetration were silent, without throat clearing or coughing.
SUMMARY: Pt continues to present with a moderate oral-pharyngeal dysphagia with minimal improvements in pharyngeal constriction and amount of pharyngeal residue, particuarly in the pyriform sinuses, since the last evaluation.
Pt continues to have trace-mild amounts of aspiration with both thin and nectar thick liquids, noted to increase secondary to [**Name (NI) 57714**] throughout the study.
Pt has less residue with thin liquids, and was noted to have slightly less aspiration after the swallow with thin liquids.
Given his MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 57714**] over time with increased aspiration, pt is not appropriate to take full meals by mouth and is only appropriate for small amounts during structured therapy sessions.
Pt has demonstrated some improvement since the last study 4 days ago, but since it is unclear if his weakness is secondary to deconditioning or a new stroke, would recommend that the video swallow be repeated in [**7-3**] days to look for improvement and to see if pt can be advanced to a PO diet from trials.
He had complete silent aspiration of liquids and solids and did not have sensation of his posterior pharynx.
