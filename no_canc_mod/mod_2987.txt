Admission Date:  [**2183-3-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2183-3-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2138-3-21**]     Sex:  F  Service:  ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44-year-old female with AIDS, hepatitis C, pancytopenia, recent acute renal failure, who was transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] after developed perfuse epistaxis.
Briefly, the patient says that she has had increased fatigue for approximately one month and for the past two months (seven times), she has had epistaxis that stops with packing of the nose with cotton and lasts for approximately two hours without any preceding trauma and occurs in either nostril.
The night prior to admission, she may have blown her nose and then developed perfuse epistaxis with clots that would not stop despite nasal packing.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for lower extremity edema since [**2182-12-12**], as well as increasing fatigue for approximately one month.
Negative for falls, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, sensation of cold, sinus headaches, chest pressure, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dark stools, bloody stools, dysuria, easy bruising or bleeding aside from epistaxis.
She then received combination therapy and despite this her CD4 count has never been greater than 400 and since having been on triple drug regimens, she has never had complete viral suppression.
Most of the more recent regimens were discontinued because of gastrointestinal side effects.
Her opportunistic infections include Cryptosporidium and candidal esophagitis, Salmonella and herpes labialis.
Her risk factors include intravenous drug use.
Hepatitis C cirrhosis followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She is HCV arthropathy and has received interferon once a week.
Pancytopenia on Neupogen twice per week.
Acute renal failure of unknown cause since [**2183-2-10**].
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Mitral valve prolapse since childhood.
ALLERGIES:  Kaletra causes diarrhea and nausea and Prinivil causes fatigue.
DDI causes peripheral neuropathy.
Tenofovir causes headache and disorientation.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a brother with myocardial infarction at age 45.
General:  No apparent distress.
Nose packing in place with a visible clot and a posterior pharynx, ?
petechia ?
Split S1 increased with inspiration, nondisplaced point of maximal impulse, midsystolic click midway through the systolic phase.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended with normal active bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit given perfuse epistaxis in the setting of thrombocytopenia with drop in hematocrit to 19.
Thrombocytopenia:  The patient has a baseline thrombocytopenia in the 30s to 60,000 range.
However, there seems to have been an acute or subacute process leading to symptomatic thrombocytopenia.
There was thought to be possibly due to decreased hepatic function, versus reaction to Bactrim.
It should also be noted that DIC/HUS was also considered, but felt to be less likely given the lack of schistocytes on the peripheral smear or LDH haptoglobin and INR consistent with a DIC picture.
Acute renal failure:  The patient had acute renal failure with protein in the urine and decreased albumin the serum suggesting a nephrotic syndrome.
As stated above, HUS was considered given the thrombocytopenia, renal failure, anemia and low grade fevers, however, given the findings on peripheral smear, as well as the findings mentioned above, this was felt to be less likely.
Throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, she was mildly oliguric with a urine output of approximately 20-30 cc per hour.
A renal biopsy was performed on [**2183-3-14**] to better elucidate the cause of the renal failure.
The renal biopsy preliminary results are consistent with a membranoproliferative disease, as well as a immunofluorescence pattern consistent with glomerulonephritis.
Of note, there was no evidence of FSGS which would be present in the setting of HIV nephropathy, nor was there any evidence of hypertensive nephropathy and thus ACE inhibitors were not initiated.
There was also no evidence for ATN.
It was the thought at the time of dictation, that the glomerulonephritis picture could be secondary to hepatitis C or a subclinical infection.
However, it seems that hepatitis C would be an unlikely culprit given that her viral load was undetectable and this had been a chronic issue, but the renal failure was a subacute issue.
HIV:  The patient was followed by both Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**], as well as the Infectious Disease Service.
Leukocytosis:  Given that the patient receives Neupogen on Tuesday's and Friday's, it was felt that the transient leukocytosis on Wednesday's and Saturday's were secondary to Neupogen injection the night prior.
Other causes of infection were also considered such as Clostridium difficile, which was negative times three.
The patient did have a low grade temperature which did not exceed 100.1.
It was felt that this could be secondary to drug fever in the setting of Neupogen administration.
Hepatitis C cirrhosis:  The Lasix and Aldactone were continued as above.
Pain Control:  The patient has diffuse pain throughout all of her joints, as well as her head.
Her pain was very well-controlled with the PCA and she was weaned down to a Dilaudid dose per day of .5 mg.
Sinusitis:  It was initially thought that the patient might have sinusitis as a result of the nasal packing.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  She was maintained on Renagel and Tums for hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia.
Membranoproliferative nephropathy presumed immune related thrombocytopenia.
Prescription for daily CBC check, as well as typed and screened for platelets at [**Hospital 3320**] Hospital.
