Admission Date:  [**2137-4-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-4-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-10-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Hydromorphone / Amoxicillin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea, tachypnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: 78 M w/ ESRD on HD MWF, CAD s/p CABG (LIMA-->LAD, SVG-->OM1 and OM2) and St. [**Initials (NamePattern4) 1525**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1291**] ([**12-12**]), sCHF w/ LVEF 30%, admitted from [**Hospital 100**] rehab today for sudden onset dyspnea, which began upon awakening this AM at 0900.
He had been hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 89672**] for S.aureus and VRE bacteremia and decompensated sCHF w/ subsequent initiation of CVVH.
Today, the pt had been c/o dyspnea, which was worse with sitting up and improving somewhat while lying supine, with very mild midline substernal chest pressure.
His wife also reports increased facial "puffiness" and increased sacral and B/L UE edema.
At rehab, he was given 5u insulin for FSBS 500, 2mg morphine and 40mg IV lasix for volume overload, although patient is anuric at baseline and has ESRD requiring HD 3x/ wk.
Denies pleuritic pain, hemoptysis, cough, fevers, chills, or other complaints.
In the ED, he appeared uncomfortable and was placed on supplemental O2.
There he was noted to have a Troponin of 0.47, which is around his baseline and BNP of >70,000 and appeared volume overloaded on exam.
CXR was c/w volume overload although underlying RLL PNA could not be excluded, so he was given IV vancomycin and was written for levofloxacin and clindamycin.
In the MICU, pt appeared uncomfortable and tachypenic, with use of accessory muscles of respiration and complains of lethargy.
His wife reports that he may have had sick contacts as he has been living at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab since his discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-19**] when he was treated for dyspnea thought to be [**3-6**] volume overload and for VRE bacteremia w/ PO [**Month/Day (2) 11958**]/flagyl.
Patient states he had sudden onset of feeling weak, tired and short of breath this morning.
He denies chest pain, fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, abdominal discomfort or diarrhea.
He denies having had a cough or bringing up sputum although was intermittently coughing during the interview.
Past Medical History: --chronic sCHF(EF 30%) --ESRD on HD --Chronic L-pleural effusion --Prior GI bleed - ?rectal ulcer --HLD --IDDM --chronic AF on coumadin --CVA with no residual neurologic deficits --Hypothyroidism --AS s/p [**Month/Day (2) 1291**] [**Hospital3 **] --Hyperparathyroidism --R-AVF --Rectal Ulcers: CMV positive --BCx during his prior hospitalization grew Aeromonas hydrophilia which was treated with 6wks cipro, last day [**2137-2-5**].
--More recently on [**2-5**] at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, due to persistent diarrhea, the patient was empirically started on Flagyl for cdiff colitis  Social History: Married, former salesman, several children.

Findings suggest fluid overload, possibly due to CHF with moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and right greater than left bilateral pleural effusions.
Right base opacity may represent combination of layering fluid and atelectasis, given that the patient is semi-erect, however, underlying consolidation is also of concern.
Additionally, patchy left base retrocardiacopacity is seen, which could be due to aspiration, infection, chronic atelectasis.
ECHO [**2137-4-16**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Again, there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the right, with associated compressive atelectatic changes at the bases.
Left PICC has its tip within the subclavian or proximal left brachiocephalic vein.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 M w/ ESRD on HD (MWF), CAD s/p CABG and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) 1525**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1291**], systolic CHF (EF=30%), and AF on Coumadin, presents from [**Hospital1 10151**] with acute onset dyspnea and respiratory distress, likely in the setting of volume overload.
# DYSPNEA: Most likely secondary to volume overload given [**Hospital1 **] exam, BNP >70,000, known systolic CHF, and CXR findings.
Patient initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics ([**Hospital1 11958**]/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]) given concern for possible HCAP, though these were later discontinued as the dyspnea was felt to be secondary to volume overload.
Cardiac meds were optomized to help decrease afterload and minimize the contribution of his mitral regurgitation on his pulmonary edema.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Felt to be secondary to infectious etiology, and was concern for C. diff given recent infection and persistent diarrhea.
Patient was also started on empiric antibiotics for treatment of possible PNA or bacteremia given history and dyspnea on presentation, and blood cultures sent.
Was felt that acute presentation of dyspnea more likely secondary to volume overload, and as above antibiotics for pneumonia were discontinued.
# DIARRHEA: Per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab notes, pt having loose stools [**3-8**] x/day and continues on PO flagyl.
Patient switched to IV flagyl for increased absorption.
# ESRD on HD: Patient received CRRT w/ 2L removed on day of admission, and had several sessions of HD while in the hospital.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient has previously been rate controlled with carvedilol and digoxin.
Digoxin held on admission given high level, and patient not on beta blocker at present.
On warfarin for anticoagulation, though this was initially held in setting of supratherapeutic INR, restarted on discharge.
# CAD s/p CABG/[**Last Name (STitle) 1291**]: Continued aspirin.
# DEPRESSION: Held home zoloft while pt on [**Last Name (STitle) 11958**] given risk of serotonin syndrome (although pt had been getting both at rehab).
# CELLULITIS: Patient has h/o left lateral leg cellulitis s/p debridement at bedside on day prior to admission.
Dressing C/D/I, and wound appeared well-healed w/ granulation tissue and scant serous drainage on bandage.
These decisions were made in conjuction with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 118**], the pt and the patients wife with the understanding that the patient's chronic renal failure and CHF contribute to a tenuous and difficult to manage volume status.
Prior to discharge the patient was having significant discomfort with respirations and morphine was initiated for comfort.
3. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for sob, wheeze.
8. loperamide 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a day as needed for diarrhea.
9. olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)) as needed for insomnia, anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 100**] Rehab Facility MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Congestive heart failure Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **], You were admitted with shortness of breath from an exacerbation of your heart failure.
It also seems that you may have developed a pneumonia during your hospitalization, so you were treated with antibiotics.
