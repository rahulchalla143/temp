Admission Date:  [**2163-7-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-8-2**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: lisinopril / Levofloxacin / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with bare metal stents to the Right coronary artery and left circumflex artery.
History of Present Illness: 87yo woman w/ a PMHx of CAD (noted on cath [**2151**]), Afib on dabigatran, and valvular HD presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with 2 days of intermittent midline chest discomfort as well as bilateral jaw discomfort, increasing weakness, and nausea w/ no vomiting.
She has been taking nitroglycerin with intermittent relief of this pain but has resisted until today coming to the hospital until her daughter urged her.
In the ED, EKG was notable for A-Fib @87bpm and ST elev in 3, aVF, V5-V6.
In cath lab, pt was found to have blockage of OM and RCA.
OM was stented but pt's symptoms failed to improve.
Pt subsequently received RCA with resolution of symptoms.
Case was otherwise uncomplicated and pt is asymptomatic on transfer to CCU.
CARDIAC HISTORY: Cath [**2151**]:Three vessel by cardiac catheter [**2151**] with 60% LAD stenosis, 75% left circumflex/obtuse marginal stenosis and 60-70% proximal RCA stenosis 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Mitral regurgitation Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Sinus bradycardia Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Coronary artery disease Gastroesophageal reflux Hiatal hernia Anemia Morbid obesity Venous insufficiency Degenerative disc disease CHF diastolyic  Social History: Pt lives alone and is fully independent at this time.
Family History: Daughter has a hx of CAD and is s/p 2 stents.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: No JVD appreciated but unable to raise pt to 45 degrees CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: B/l 2+ pitting leg edema.
No femoral bruits.
No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a 60% lesion in its mid segment, and an 80% lesion in the D1.
The LCx had a hazy 95% lesion at a bifurcation of the OM1 with extension back into the proximal LCx.
The proximal RCA had a diffuse, 80-90% lesion with a aneurysmal vs. ulcerated segment.
The LVEDP was moderately elevated at 23 mmHg consistent with moderate diastolic heart failure.
There was no gradient across the aortic valve with pullback.
Successful PCI of LCX bifurcation disease with Integrity RX 2.5 x 18 mm BMS to lower pole of OM branch back into main LCX vessel.
Ongoing discomfort during procedure, so decided to proceed to intervention on proximal RCA lesion.
Moderately elevated LVEDP consistent with moderate diastolic heart failure.
Inferolateral STEMI with successful PCI using BMI of LCX/OM and proximal RCA.
TTE: [**2163-8-1**] The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: 87yo female w/ a hx of CAD, Afib, valvular heart disease (MR+TR) who presented to [**Hospital3 **] complaining of CP radiating to jaw for 3 days.
On work up found to have ST elevation inferiorlateral MI transfered urgently to cath lab at [**Hospital1 18**].
#STEMI: EKG at [**Hospital1 **] notable for ST elevations in AvF, III, and v5, v6 and had (+)trop which was concerning for LCx teritory STEMI.
In the cath lab, patient was found to have blockage of OM and RCA.
Patient had successful PCI of LCX bifurcation disease with Integrity RX 2.5 x 18 mm BMS to lower pole of OM branch back into main LCX vessel.
Subsequently patient continued to have ongoing discomfort during procedure, so decision was amde to proceed to intervention on proximal RCA lesion with successful PCI with Integrity RX 3.0 x 26 mm bare metal stent with excellent result.
Patient was transfered to CCU for monitoring where she remained free of chest pain.
She had TTE once day after cath which showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall with EF 50-55%.
# Acute on Chornic Diastolic CHF: Patient's contined to be euvolemic.
#Anemia: Most likely secondary to chronic GI bleed [**1-13**] to peptic ulcer.
- She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for management of her anemia and CAD.
