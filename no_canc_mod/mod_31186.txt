During her past admission, abdominal CT demonstrated only diverticulosis, no evidence of diverticulitis or any acute infectious process.
She had serial negative c. diff toxins, but was treated empirically for c. diff colitis with Vanc and Flagyl.
She has chronically elevated WBC count with ?
She also had evidence of a UTI, and was treated with Bactrim.
On day of admission, pt found hypotensive at NH with SBP in the 60's, and was reported to appear [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and lethargic.
On the floor, she again became hypotensive to the 80's systolic and had a dark, guaiac positive stool.
She was also given one dose of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin for broad coverage with suspision of sepsis.
In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the pt underwent a bleeding scan which showed a jejunal bleed.
A angiogram showed no active bleeding.
Colonoscopy showed flecks of blood but no active bleeding.
HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MM dry, OP clear, ecchymosis on bottom lip.
Cor: RRR with faint 1/6 systolic murmur appreciated over apex.
Abd: soft, NT/ND, +BS, no masses or organomegaly, multiple ecchymoses Extr: cool extremities.
Bleeding scan: IMPRESSION: Findings most consistent with a jejunal bleed.
No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Large right and small left pleural effusion with associated subsegmental compressive atelectasis.
Atherosclerotic disease throughout the visualized aorta.
Radiation changes most evident in the left upper lobe consistent with the patient's history of radiation for breast cancer.
No source of bleeding was identified.
CXR [**2158-12-20**]:IMPRESSION: New small right pleural effusion.
right LENI [**2158-12-26**]:IMPRESSION: Segmental region of nearly occlusive thrombus in the right common femoral vein.
Decrease in bilateral pleural effusions with interval improvement of previously seen pulmonary edema.
87 yo woman with recent admission for abdominal pain, discharged with treatment for diverticulitis and UTI, readmitted after episode hypotension/pre-syncope and found to have upper GI bleed with exposed duodenal artery.
Currently hemodynamically stable but found to have difficulty swallowing.
*GI bleed: Had GI bleed with exposed duodenal artery found on EGD.
Patient has been hemodynamically stable with stable hct for several days.
Gastrin level was found to be elevated and patient should follow-up with GI as an outpatient to have Gastrin level repeated.
Per prior notes, pt has evidence of old CVA on head CT.
Per family, patient had no difficulty swallowing prior to admission.
Patient then agreed to have PEG tube placed for long term nutrition, with possibility of removal if her swallowing improved.
Her difficulty swallowing was thought likely secondary to deconditioning.
*Leukocytosis: Had h/o leukocytosis that had not been clearly attributed to an infectious process.
More likely related to her chronic corticosteroid use.
Patient continued to be afebrile throughout her stay.
* Pleural effusions: Pt with bilateral pleural effusions with R>L.
* h/o presumed Temporal Arteritis: Has been on long steroid taper.
These meds were initially held secondary to hypotension.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Duodenal ulcer Upper GI bleed   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please return to the hospital if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness/ dizziness, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea or any other severe symptoms.
