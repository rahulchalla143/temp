PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS  FINDINGS:  Since most recent radiograph, there has been significant improvement to right- sided pleural effusion, now small in size with a persistent smaller left-sided effusion.
There is improved aeration in the lower lobes bilaterally with areas of residual atelectasis noted at the right and left lung base.
No new parenchymal consolidations are identified.
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
Calcification projecting over the lung apices likely is within vasculature as noted on prior CT examination.
Small infrahilar calcified lymph nodes are better appreciated on prior CT scan.
IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement of small bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left).
Left atrial abnormality.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2117-3-9**] there is variation in precordial lead placement and ST-T wave flattening.
The positional lateral precordial leads has changed and there is now recorded downsloping ST segment depression and biphasic T waves in leads V5-V6.

FINDINGS: There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.
The previously noted area of slightly high signal in the left occipital lobe is only very faintly seen today.
There are large amounts of periventricular T2 white matter hyperintensity, consistent with large amounts of chronic microvascular ischemic change.
There is no midline shift or mass effect.
There appears to be fluid in the mastoid sinus air cells bilaterally as before, which could be due to recent intubation.
There is no evidence of herniation.
There does not appear to be any acute infarct.
There are large amounts of chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
The previously described abnormality in the left occipital lobe is only very faintly visualized on todays exam.
However, as on the prior MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2117-3-11**], there is a fetal origin of the left posterior cerebral artery.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 87 year old woman with post Aortic and mitral valve replacement, new seizure REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Stroke?
No prior studies for comparison.
FINDINGS:  On the T2 trace diffusion-weighted images, there is increased signal, suggestive of restricted diffusion in the left occipital cortex and could most likely represent an acute infarct.
However, corresponding abnormality on the ADC sequence is not appreciated.
On the FLAIR images, there is mildly increased signal intensity in the adjacent portion of the white matter and part of the left occipital cortex.
There are several small foci of increased signal intensity in bilateral cerebral white matter, on the FLAIR images, which could most likely represent sequelae of chronic small vessel occlusive disease.
On the gradient echo susceptibility weighted images, there is no evidence of hemorrhage.
3D TOF MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: Bilateral intracranial internal carotid, anterior cerebral artery on the right side, and bilateral middle cerebral arteries are patent and normal in caliber.
Bilateral distal vertebral, basilar, and right posterior cerebral arteries are patent and normal in caliber.
On the left side, there is a fetal PCA.
Area of restricted diffusion in the left occipital cortex, most likely suggesting acute stroke.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 251**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]   FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Frequent left mid-temporal spike and slow wave complexes were seen, at times up to 1 Hz frequency.
ABNORMALITY #2: Occasional left temporal theta slowing was seen.
ABNORMALITY #3: Bursts of generalized intermixed theta and delta  slowing were noted in the waking state.
ABNORMALITY #4: A 7 Hz slow and disorganized background was noted in the waking state.
HYPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated due to patient's mental status.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the frequent left temporal spike and slow wave complexes, the left temporal theta slowing, the bursts of generalized slowing and the slow and disorganized background.
The first abnormality suggests a left temporal focus of potential epileptogenesis, while the second abnormality suggests left temporal subcortical dysfunction.
The third and fourth abnormalities suggest a mild encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections, toxic metabolic abnormalities or medication effect.
Congestive heart failure.
Mitral valve disease.
Shortness of breath.
Valvular heart disease.
