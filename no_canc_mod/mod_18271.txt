Details of event unclear, patient has no recollection of antecedant events.

Currently comfortable - sternal pain controlled.
Denies h/o anginal-type chest pain.
SOB at baseline.
No dysuria, LUTS.
No recent changes in medications.
No prior events.
Past Medical History: Limited: COPD on home 02 HTN Hyperlipidemia Afib on coumadin DM2 Gout  Social History: Lives with daughter and son-in-law.
[**Name (NI) **] she is generally functional independently  Family History: n/c  Physical Exam: Vitals: 98.3, HR 84, BP 130/82, RR 20, 91% on 3L Gen: comfortable, eating crackers, nad HEENT: anicteric, MMM, PERRLA Neck: supple, no jugular venous distention; no carotid bruits CV: RRR, nl s1 and s2, no significant murmurs, rubs or gallops; Large area of ecchymosis over sternum.
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds bilaterally, bibasilar crackles Abd: +bs, soft, ntnd; liver and spleen not palpated Ext: scattered ecchymoses; no edema.
No acute intracranial injury.
No skull fracture.
Moderate atrophy with chronic caudate nuclei lacunes, bilaterally.
No evidence of fracture.
Extensive degenerative changes of the cervical spine with the most profound area of abnormality at C5-C6, where there is moderate canal and moderate foraminal stenosis.
Severe panacinar emphysema in the lung apices.
Smooth intralobular septal thickening which raises the question of volume overload.
1.3 cm hypodense right thyroid nodule for which ultrasound followup is recommended if not already performed.
No specific findings to suggest acute fracture, however correlation with site of pain recommended.
[**2115-10-9**] Echocardiogram: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
The constellation of findings of right ventricular enlargement and pulmonary artery hypertension is suggestive of a primary pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism) ?acute on chronic.
Impaction of right lower lobe bronchi with partial right lower lobe collapse.
Associated soft tissue density surrounding central bronchovascular structures raises concern for possible neoplastic mass, although inflammatory process surrounding the bronchi is also possible.
Incompletely imaged abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring approximately 4 cm with possible chronic dissection.
Severe emphysema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Impaction of right lower lobe bronchi with mild improvement in the degree of right lower lobe aeration.
Previously described soft tissue density surrounding the right lower lobe bronchovascular structures is unchanged and concern for possible neoplastic mass is not further evaluated without contrast.
Severe emphysema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Incompletely imaged abdominal aortic aneurysm with possible chronic dissection.
female with PMHx of COPD, CHF, atrial fibrillation, macular degeneration, hyperlipidemia, and DM admitted for syncope work-up s/p fall, transferred to ICU for management of hypoxia likely due to RLL collapse from mucous plugging versus PNA verus mass in patient with severe [**Hospital 2182**] transferred to ICU for hypoxia.
#  Shortness of breath secondary to RLL collapse in patient with severe COPD and splinting due to chest wall hematoma.
Also with fevers and bandemia initially which resolved.
CT on [**10-10**] showed RLL collapse secondary to possible mucous plug vs neoplastic mass.
She underwent repeat CT chest with contrast which showed similar right lower lobe lung finding (results above) again raising question of inflammatory process vs neoplasm.
Further work-up including bronchoscopy and washings was discussed and also discussed possibility of lung mass and further work-up with this.
Theophylline was discontinued in light of possible episode of syncope (though Theophylline was measured to be slightly sub-therapeutic at 8.3).
Continued pain control for chest contusion to avoid splinting with Lidocaine patch and ATC acetaminophen with PRN oxycodone  # SYNCOPE:   Etiology of syncope remains unclear, although sounds cardiac (?
Cardiac enzymes were negative and echo did not reveal a source of syncope: no aortic stenosis although [**1-22**]+ AR/TR/MR.
Carotid ultrasounds were performed, and no significant stenoses bilaterally.
Monitored on telemetry without arrythmias.
FeNa of 0.8% upon admission suggested prerenal etiology.
Patient has chest wall hematoma due to syncopal event.
Continued around the clock tylenol, PRN vicadin, and lidocaine patch which seemed to be controlling her pain.
# AAA: Patient incidentally noted to have a 4 cm AAA with possible chronic dissection on her chest CT.  She did not have signs/symptoms of acute issue during this hospitalization.
# HTN: Normotensive.
Held lisinopril in setting of ARF and controlled blood pressure.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Supratherapeutic on Coumadin on presentation.
No acute gout flare during hospitalization.
# DM:  Continued glipizide and sliding scale insulin.
# DEPRESSION:  Continued outpatient Sertraline.
# FEN:  Cardiac healthy/diabetic diet.
