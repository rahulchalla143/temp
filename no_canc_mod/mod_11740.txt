Admission Date:  [**2188-12-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2188-12-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2136-4-20**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Neurosurgery  DIAGNOSIS: Massive basal ganglia intraparenchymal bleed and brain stem death.
A CT scan showed a large deep basal ganglia bleed with ventricular obliteration and midline shift of at least 8 mm.
This showed that there was no evidence of aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation to suggest a source for the intracranial hemorrhage.
He had a dilated right pupil.
A repeat CT scan was performed and findings were consistent with increasing intracranial pressure with worsening of subfalcine and uncal herniation.
In addition, there was a new cerebellar infarction.
He was receiving mannitol to prevent further worsening of his cerebral edema.
He had a repeat head CT scan on [**2188-12-15**] and this showed an increase leftward subfalcine herniation and ongoing massive posterior infarction, and also evidence of herniation.
At this point, clinically, the patient had fixed dilated bilateral pupils.
There was no response to pain and it was decided that the brain stem function was compromised and brain stem functions were being performed.
In the meanwhile, he also had a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate for his refractory hypertension.
There was no evidence of pheochromocytoma or renal artery stenosis.
There was gradual severe deterioration in the patient's general condition and two sets of brain stem tests were performed on [**2188-12-16**] and the patient was declared brain stem dead on [**2188-12-16**].
