Admission Date:  [**2177-8-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2177-8-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2105-2-16**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year old nursing home resident with hypertension, hyperlipidemia and history of a cerebrovascular accident, who was transferred from [**Location (un) 3844**] to [**Hospital6 3872**] at around 10:00 a.m. on [**2177-8-8**] with acute onset shortness of breath and in respiratory distress.
Although he was unable to give a complete history, he denied any chest pain, abdominal pain or diaphoresis.
Initial electrocardiogram showed Q waves in inferior leads as well as V1 through V4 with ST elevation in leads V1 through V6.
While at [**Hospital3 1280**], the patient progressed to a right bundle branch block and then finally to complete heart block with an episode of ventricular tachycardia.
A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, akinesis of the septal, apical and inferior walls.
He was then intubated and placed on Dopamine and heparin and transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for cardiac catheterization.
The cardiac catheterization showed two vessel coronary artery disease with a normal left main coronary artery, 100% occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery, which was stented, a 90% occlusion of the right coronary artery, which was stented, and a normal left circumflex artery.
Due to extensive cardiogenic shock, the patient was placed on maximum doses of Dopamine, Neo-Synephrine and Levophed as well as having an intra-aortic balloon pump placed before leaving the catheterization laboratory.
A temporary pacemaker was also inserted and he was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for continuos hemodynamic monitoring of his cardiogenic shock.
Cerebrovascular accident.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Status post motor vehicle accident with closed head injury.
Diabetes mellitus.
Chest:  Lungs with occasional rales at bilateral bases.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate, normal S1 and S2, no murmur, rub or gallop appreciated.
Extremities:  Bilateral groin sites without oozing or hematoma, lower extremities mottled and toes cold with absent dorsalis pedis pulses by palpation or Doppler, with 1+ posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
Neurologic: Unresponsive to painful stimuli, no gag or cough reflex present, positive Babinski sign on left and unequivocal Babinski on the right.
Chest x-ray confirmed proper endotracheal tube placement with mild pulmonary congestion, consistent with congestive heart failure.
IMPRESSION:  A 72 year old man with a very large acute ST elevation myocardial infarction, with stents placed to the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex, with history of complete heart block and cardiogenic shock, still hypotensive despite maximization of three pressors and intra-aortic balloon pump.
There was no intrinsic rhythm.
IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF DEATH: Myocardial infarction.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Diabetes mellitus.
