In the [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab he was found to have a 99% mid-RCA lesion with poor-flow which was treated with thrombectomy and 2x BMS (may have jailed acute marginal branch).
There was initially no reflow, but this improved with IC nifedipine.
Elevated Mean RAP 15; mean PCWP 16.
During the procedure he was became bradycardic into the 40's which resolved spontaneously.
After the procedure he was chest-pain free although he did develop a small R-groin hematoma with sheath in(2x2cm); the sheath was removed, pressure applied, and aggronox was discontinued.
Prior to this event he was able to walk and play golf w/o chest pain or SOB; although his movement is limited by chronic lower back pain.

There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.

Brief Hospital Course: #)Cardiac a. Ischemia/Rhythm: Mr [**Known lastname 51459**] presented with an inferior STEMI; he was taken urgently to the cath lab where he was found to have a proximal RCA lesion which was treated with thrombectomy + 2 BMS.
He had a small groin hematoma so his integrellin was d/c'd shortly after transfer.
His hct dropped from 34 to 27.7 prompting blood transfusion and CT abdomen/pelvis which showed some diffuse hemorrhage in the left thigh.
He was vomiting and visibly aspirated and was therefore intubated for airway protection.
Temporary pacer wires placed but then discontinued due to MRSA bacteremia.
Pump: Echo showed LVEF of 40% with RV hypokinesis and 3+ MR. Hypotension resolved s/p 1d on dopa/dobuta.
Captopril titrated up for afterload reduction.
#) Bacteremia: Mr [**Known lastname 51459**] became febrile post-intubateion/line placement.
As his heart block resolved (indicating recovering electrical and RV function), he was diuresed with prn Lasix boluses and was euvolemic upon discharge.
#) Hematoma: D1 s/p cath had small groin hematoma but increasing thigh pain and falling hct; Hct was trended and subsequently remained stable.
CT showed no RPB but possible hematoma diffusely in thigh.
RLE US showed no DVT .
#) h/o GIB - pt has endorsed melena at home; no gross GI bleed while in-house - consider GI scope as outpatient - cont protonix .
