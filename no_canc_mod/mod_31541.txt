Subsequent studies showed the following:  Echocardiogram was done on [**2161-6-17**], which showed an ejection fraction of 60 percent, an ascending aorta 4.9 cm with aortic valve peak velocity of 2.6, and a gradient of 26 mm, 1 plus AI,  1 plus MR, and borderline pulmonary artery systolic pressure hypertension.
Cardiac catheterization which was performed in [**6-28**], showed normal coronary arteries, mild aortic insufficiency, normal LV function with LVEDP of 17, a cardiac index of 2.3, no gradient across the aortic valve, and a large aneurysm in the ascending aorta.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Right ovarian oophorectomy, right partial mastectomy with two subsequent tissue removal surgeries, and a left leg benign tumor removal.
ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
No use of other recreational drugs.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  CT scan of the chest on [**2161-6-4**] showed a 5 cm ascending aorta, small pulmonary AV malformation in the right lobe, in the medial basal segment, and descending aorta within normal limits.
Preoperatively, her EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 57 with left anterior hemiblock.
On exam, she appeared to be well- hydrated, appearing younger than her stated age with no rashes or lesions.
Her neck was supple with no JVD, lymphadenopathy, or thyromegaly.
Her chest was clear bilaterally without wheezing, rhonchi, or rales.
Her heart was bradycardiac in a regular rhythm with positive S1 and S2 sounds and a grade 2 to 3 over 6 systolic murmur heard best at the lower sternal border and third intercostal space.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal bowel sounds.
Her extremities were warm and well perfused with no edema or cyanosis.
She had no obvious varicosities.
She had 2 plus bilateral femoral pulses, 2 plus bilateral DP pulses, 1 plus bilateral PT pulses, and 2 plus bilateral radial pulses without any carotid bruit.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission, [**2161-7-17**], she underwent ascending aortic aneurysm repair with a 26 mm Gelweave tube graft and an aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm Regent mechanical valve.
She had an echocardiogram to rule out any cardiac tamponade from bleeding.
She was on an insulin drip at 4 for mildly elevated blood sugars.
Her abdominal exam and incisional exams were benign.
She had increased mediastinal contour on chest x- ray, but remained clinically stable.
She had decreased breath sounds at the bases.
On postoperative day four, she was doing well without any complaints of shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations.
She remained in a sinus rhythm with good pulses and minimal peripheral edema.
She continued with a 3 mg Coumadin dose and started iron for some mild anemia.
On[**Last Name (STitle) 14810**]perative day five, she had no new complaints and was doing very well.
She had no dyspnea, chest pain, or other palpitations.
She remained in sinus rhythm without any JVD or peripheral edema.
The patient did have some diarrhea on the [**2161-7-23**] during the evening and was given some trazodone also to help her feel a little bit more comfortable.
She had a small nosebleed and complained a little bit of some cramping without a bowel movement.
At  03:30 in the morning on the [**2161-7-24**] she was in sinus rhythm with the exception of quick bursts of sinus tachycardia.
The patient had no complaints and was sleeping at the time.
