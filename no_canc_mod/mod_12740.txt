Found to have large cerebellar hemorrhage.
History of Present Illness: 80 y/o RHM with h/o HTN, CAD s/p CABG and A-fib on coumadin (full PMH and meds not known on transfer; OSH records and meds request) presented to an OSH with nausea and headache.
The patient describes acute onset of dizziness w/o exertion followed by [**4-2**] frontal midline headache and nausea/vomiting.
He also noted difficulty walking straight and describes veering to the left, spinning in a circle to the left when walking.
The patient denies trauma, vision changes, LOC, or difficulty speaking at the time.
A similar episode of acute dizziness without nausea/vomiting, but with so much spinning to the left that he had to put himself into a corner, occurred 6 months ago but resolved within 30 minutes and no medical attention was sought.
At the OSH, he had persistent hypertension with BP of 190/110.
Head CT showed L cerebellar hemorrhage and the patient was given 10mg of vitamin K for an INR of 1.9.
On admission he had an elevated Troponin of 0.3 which has been trending down, likely due to demand ischemia.
Clinical exam has been stable and no hematoma expansion or transtentorial herniation was seen on repeat head CT.
Past Medical History:  CAD s/p CABG, HTN, atrial fibrillation, HLD, prostate CA s/p radical prostatectomy, s/p bilateral cateract surgery, presbycusis   Social History: Patient has been retired for the last 10 years; previously involved in "adapting machinery to be automated."
Has occasional EtOH.

Echo Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinetic septum, anterior hypokinesis and basal inferior akinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION: Severely dilated left ventricle with severe regional left ventricular dysfunction.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate aortic stenosis (low gradient).
Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital 39928**] Hospital Course:  Mr [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to the neurosurgery service on [**7-22**] and had a poor exam on admission.
On admission he had an elevated Troponin of 0.3 which has been trending down, likely due to demand ischemia.
Initially floor stay was complicated by difficult to control blood pressure with systolic blood pressures greater than 160 and intermittent worsening mental status, and new nystagmus, so he was transferred back to the ICU where he was placed on a Nicardipine drip.
To further evaluate waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, chest X-ray and urine cultures were obtained with no sign of acute infection.
Echocardiogram in the hospital revealed poor ejection fraction of 25-30% and severely dilated left veintricle.
He also had moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic stenosis, and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The most recent changes include increased Lisinopril, and addition of the Norvasc.
Amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for hypertension.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: L cerebellar hemorrhage   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after you had nausea and headache and had a CT scan which showed a large bleeding stroke in your brain, in the cerebellum.
You were also found to have a heart arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation).
