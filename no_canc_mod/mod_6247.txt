Left minimally displaced intertrochanteric femoral fracture.
Possible irregularity at the left tibial plateau, for which dedicated knee radiographs should be performed.
Minimal shoulder degenerative changes with unchanged calcific tendinitits.
Possible small left elbow joint effusion, although no fracture is definitely identified.
EKG [**1-31**]: Sinus bradycardia with A-V conduction delay.
Intra-atrial conduction delay.
Lateral lead ST-T wave abnormalities with borderline [**Month/Day (4) 5937**] interval may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy but clinical correlation is suggested.
Post-op hip xray [**2-1**]: FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION: Multiple intraoperative fluoroscopic images of the left hip.
Improved alignment of the intertrochanteric fracture.
No definite dislocation.
Brief Hospital Course: 88 yo female with PMH of CAD, CHF, PAF, AS, presenting s/p mechanical fall with subsequent left intertroch fracture s/p ORIF, transferred back to medicine for management of medical issues.
# Left hip fracture s/p ORIF:  The description of the fall seems to be mechanical as there was no preceding prodrome to suggest syncope and no loss of conciousness or cardiac symptoms to suggest arrhythmia.
Pt was admitted to medicine prior to surgical repair given her comorbidities of a.fib, CHF, and severe AS.
She tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well without intraoperative complication.
After the procedure she remained intubated and was monitored in the ICU as prophylaxis due to concern of possible flash pulmonary edema due to interoperative fluids.
She received routine post op care and pain was controlled with standing tylenol and IV morphine which was eventually weaned to a PO regimen, and eventually just standing tylenol.
#Hct drop:  Pt with steady Hct drop from 38.1 on admission to 25.7 on discharge.
No sign of bleed and surgical site does not appear to have hematoma.
Symptomatically she denied any CP or SOB, however does have persistent fatigue which has been her baseline.
Given her severe AS she is preload dependent and BPs were closely watched throughout admission.
# Diastolic CHF:  Pt noted have diastolic CHF with preserved EF on echo from 4/[**2138**].
# CAD:  S/p PCI of prox LAD in [**2-23**], NSTEMI and in-stent restenosis treated with PTCA and DESx2 to mid-LAD in [**6-28**].
No signs or symptoms to suggest her fall is cardiac in nature.
Of note, she received a repeat EKG during episode of abdominal pain (see below) which was significant for ST depressions TWI I/aVL which were possibly increased from baseline.
However, it was thought that this was more likely to be rate related given her tachycardia at the time and she did not seem to have any signs or symptoms of ischemia.
# Abdominal Pain: On the floor postoperatively, her pain was well controlled and she had no shortness of breath or chest pain.
She did experience an episode of right upper quardant abdominal pain.
An ECG was obtained and as above was notable for mild ST changes as compared to prior, but it was thought this was rate related and there did not appear to be any cardiac signs or symptoms.
The pain was most consistent with consipation/gas pain.
However she remained constipated requiring manual disimpaction.
She subsequently was discharged on colace/senna/miralax, and PRN dulcolax suppository.
# CKD:  Recent baseline 1.6-1.8.
# Gout:  Continued home allopurinol .
