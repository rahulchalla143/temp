[**Name (NI) **] daughter and wife, no diarrhea.
Incontinent of urine at baseline but no foul smell recently.
The MICU team felt that he did not require ICU level of care so he was admitted to the medicine service for further observation  Past Medical History: HTN [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia h/o falls Parkinson's disease  Social History: Lives at [**Hospital3 2558**].

brain atrophy and areas of chronic lacunar infarction.
[**10-15**] Head CT: HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Again demonstrated within the right subdural space is a heterogeneous fluid collection, which is predominantly hypodense in attenuation with small foci of hyperattenuation noted.
The appearance of this subdural hematoma is not significantly changed since the prior examination.
There is associated mass effect upon the adjacent right cerebral cortex, which is unchanged since the prior examination, and only minimal right to left midline shift is again demonstrated, which also is unchanged since the prior examination.
There are no new areas of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage noted.
The ventricles and sulci are stable in size, and there is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are again noted along with focal hypodensities within the basal ganglia, findings consistent with chronic microvascular and lacunar infarction.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and left mastoid air cells are clear.
Post- surgical changes within the right mastoid air cells are again demonstrated with an air fluid level, unchanged in the interval.
No new areas of hemorrhage identified.

Then, in AM of [**2170-10-7**], he decompensated with temp to 101.6, rigors, and hypotension with SBP of 80's.
He was initially stabilized with 4L of NS boluses, but hypotension persisted to 70's systolic.
Hypoxia persisted with sats in 80's on 100% NRB.
His hypotension was felt to be due to vasodilation from sepsis in combination with hypovolemia.
He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
The etiology of his hypoxemia was unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) 227**] his rapidly deteriorating neurolgic function from Parkinsons' he may have aspirated, although, he did not have radiologic evidence of a pneumonia.
His hypoxemia may have been due to acidosis and v/q mismatching.
LENIs did not reveal evidence of DVT.
He had moderate secretions and received aggressive chest PT, but maintained adequate O2 sats on shovel mask.
Additionally, he was started on low dose beta-blocker for hypertension and treated with free water boluses for hypernatremia.
During his ICU stay he was less responsive to stimuli and a repeat CT scan revealed unchanged size and mass effect from subdural hematoma.
He developed LUE edema and on [**10-13**] a LUE doppler was performed which showed occlusive thrombosis of both brachial veins and the axillary vein, and nearly completely occlusive thrombosis of the subclavian vein.
had not been receiving SC Heparin because of his known subdural hematoma and risk for increased bleeding and mass effect, and a decision was made not to anti-coagulate him, even given the doppler results.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] stim test was performed, with decreased Cortisol response, and pt.
A discussion was begun with the family regarding long-term nutrition and possible peg placement.
Pt remained afebrile but un-responsive.
# SDH:  - Appears to be subacute to chronic.
No hydrocephalus, no new hemorrhages.
Chronic lacunar and microvascular infarcts.
# UE DVT - hold off on anticoagulation for now given SDH .
# PPX: pneumoboots, ppi .
