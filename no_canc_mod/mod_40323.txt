AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.
Conclusions Pre-CPB: The windows are of limited quality as the heart seems rotated, and the LA seems distorted by the prolapsing mitral leaflets.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is moderate/severe bileaflet leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB: The patient is in SR, on no inotropes.
There is a prosthetic mitral valve with no leak and no MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 31845**] as pre-bypass.
