History of Present Illness: 61-year-old male with history of MVP, moderate MR p/w worsening dyspnea and worsening MR. .
Patient presented to his cardiologist with c/o dyspnea on exertion.
He was being followed by cardiology for moderate mitral valve insufficiency that for the most part had been asymptomatic.
Recently, he complained of DOE and orthopnea.
As an outpatient: ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy with sinus rhythm.
CXR showed small bilateral pleural effusions.
He then had an echo done at [**Hospital1 112**] that showed normal LV systolic function EF 65%, LV mildly enlarged at 5.6cm, mild PA pressure elevation of 35 mmHg plus RA pressure, and severe MR. .
Cardiac cath demonstrated clear coronaries, with elevated wedge pressure in the 20s.
Denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: as above, otherwise negative   Past Medical History: - Severe MR - MV Prolapse - Sensorineural hearing loss - BPH  Social History: He is [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 86**] police officer.
He is married with no children.
Family History: He has a family history of diabetes and hypertension but no heart disease (early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death).
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
+2DP SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.
The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA had no angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated left-sided filling pressure with a mean PCWP of 19mmHg and prominent v-waves to 27mmHg.
There was mild pulmonary hypertension with a PA pressure of 34/11mmHg.
No angiographically apparent coronary disease.
Elevated left-sided filling pressure.
Low systemic arterial pressures.
CXR [**2113-1-20**]: Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.

He was taken to cath lab which was notable for clean coronaries and elevated wedge pressure.
On [**2113-1-23**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he underwent a minimally invasive repair of his mitral valve with closure of a patent foramen ovale.
