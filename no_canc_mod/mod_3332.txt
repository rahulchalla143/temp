Admission Date:  [**2200-12-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2200-12-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2146-9-21**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Company 191**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for 20 years of low back pain managed with heavy-dose narcotics at home with several recent admissions in the past year for hypercarbic respiratory failure (reportedly, all these episodes have occurred since she changed her opiate regimen last Spring).
She had a recent admission approximately 10 days ago at an outside hospital for hypercarbic respiratory failure with increased troponins at that time.
She was seen in the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 346**] by the Cardiology consultation service secondary to her increase in troponin.
Increased troponins were thought to be secondary to hypotension causing demand ischemia and a troponin lead.
Her chest x-ray in the Emergency Department showed bibasilar consolidations.
A CT angiogram showed bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation with air bronchograms and numerous mediastinal lymph nodes.
There was no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
She had no acute changes on her electrocardiogram, but a heparin drip was started due to concerns of a possible acute coronary syndrome.
She remained stable on a mechanical ventilator overnight, and on the day after admission she was extubated without difficulty.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, she was seen by the Pain consultation service who recommended stopping all of her outpatient pain medications and staring a morphine patient-controlled analgesia to evaluate her daily opiate needs prior to starting a new pain control regimen.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems in the Intensive Care Unit she reported cough productive of scant sputum, though she has always had a chronic cough secondary to smoking.
At home she denied any fevers, chills, shortness of breath, or chest pain.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2195**], status post myocardial infarction.
[**2200-3-25**] cardiac catheterization showed a patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and occluded saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery, a 40% stenosis in the right internal mammary artery to right coronary artery, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 63%, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 26, and occluded left main coronary artery, a proximally occluded right coronary artery, 50% mid stenosis of the circumflex, and a 100% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending artery.
Chronic low back pain, status post laminectomy times two in the past.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Question chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ALLERGIES:  NITROGLYCERIN causes significant decreased blood pressure.
She has been on disability for the last 20 years secondary to low back pain.
Jugular venous distention at 14 cm.
Lungs had bibasilar crackles, dullness to percussion at the bases.
There was a fourth heart sound present.
No murmurs were appreciated.
There was mild diffuse tenderness which was not localized.
There was trace pitting and pretibial edema bilaterally.
Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection.
Sputum culture from the date of admission had greater than 25 neutrophils, less than 10 epithelial cells, with 1+ multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora.
Blood cultures times four and urine culture times one showed no growth.
There were no ST depressions or elevations.
There was a T wave inversion in lead V1.
CT angiogram showed numerous mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest 1.2 cm in diameter, bibasilar consolidations/atelectasis, single bulla in the right lower lobe, some air trapping in the right lower lobe, and degenerative joint disease of the spine.
A Persantine MIBI in [**2198-12-25**] showed no reversible or fixed ischemic defects with normal wall motion and an ejection fraction of 70%.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit, Ms. [**Known lastname 18929**] was admitted to the medical floor for further management of her acute medical issues.
Their opinion was that the increased troponins were due to demand ischemia and not supply ischemia.
She had no further episodes of chest pain throughout the remainder of her hospital course.
Due to a slight increase in peripheral edema during the course of her hospital stay she received several liters of intravenous fluids in the Intensive Care Unit, she was given several low doses of intravenous diuretics.
She maintained on her Neurontin for treatment of neuropathic pain.
They thought that she had some mild delirium and would benefit from an outpatient psychiatry followup.
Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure; question secondary to narcotic overdose.
Myocardial infarction.
Coronary artery disease.
Chronic low back pain.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Question chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
