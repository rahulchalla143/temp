HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 104311**] is a 66 year-old gentleman with a long standing history of diabetes, end stage renal disease and an extensive coronary artery disease who presents to the hospital with shortness of breath.
He has been in his usual state of health until five days ago when he had acute onset of shortness of breath that progressively worsened.
He denies any chest pain, fevers or chills, or any other associated symptoms.
He is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service on [**2187-1-15**] and there is shortness of breath was improved with hemodialysis, but ruled in for a non Q wave myocardial infarction with a troponin if 13, normal CK.
In the cardiac catheterization laboratory he was noted to have three vessel disease with occlusion of two saphenous vein, with occlusion of his venous graft, which is new from 8/[**2184**].
His left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery was patent with extensive collateral left and right.
His left circumflex and right coronary artery were diffusely diseased.
The left circumflex was difficult to intervene upon due to difficulty engaging the vessel, but ultimately received a stent.
During the procedure the patient had several episodes of ventricular tachycardia that was responsive to cardiac massage on at least one instance.
Diabetes type 2 insulin dependent.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis, with placement of an AV fistula in the right forearm in [**2186-6-11**].
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass graft in [**2185-6-11**], (left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal) as well as implantation of an AICD in [**2185-7-12**] for syncope and runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
History of central line infection times two as described previously.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Sclera anicteric.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen soft and benign.
Chest x-ray revealed an interval increase in cardiac shadow with a small pleural effusion suggestive of congestive heart failure.
No infiltrates were identified.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient did fine until early the next morning where he developed progressive shortness of breath.
As respiratory therapy was called to intubate the patient emergently, the patient became apneic and pulseless.
His electroencephalogram tracing on the defibrillator revealed that the patient was in ventricular tachycardia, which transformed into ventricular fibrillation.
A code was called and the patient was immediately defibrillated with no conversion from VF.
Coronary artery disease.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
