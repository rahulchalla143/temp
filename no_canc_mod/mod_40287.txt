Admission Date:  [**2184-11-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-3-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation Arterial Line placement Bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: 70-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, including CAD s/p PCI, BOOP/COP with bronchiectasis, PAD, renal artery stenosis, hypertension who was referred by her Pulmonary physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) **]: "70 year old female with chief complaint of recurrent anginal symptoms.
Known CAD and abrupt worsening of oxygenation, with concern for PE.
The patient reports that her overall worsening began in [**Month (only) 359**] when she developed a cough and wheeze.
In [**Month (only) **], the patient was seen at [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital for sharp chest pain, where a heart attack was ruled out but the patient did not receive a stress (according to her report).
The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] because of increased shortness of breath and has been on prednisone and methotrexate for a suspected recrudescence of BOOP/COP.
Over the past week, however, the patient has had intermittent short-lived episodes of substernal chest heaviness, which she reports most closely resemble angina from her previous heart problems (which include 3 stents in her coronary vessels; the patient also reports renal artery stents and what seem to be iliac stenting on left).
The patient reports that her angina-like symptoms do indeed appear upon exertion and appear to be relived with rest.
Over the past week, however, the patient has also had an increased oxygen requirement at home and desaturates upon activity into the mid 70s (she has a finger pleth at home).
She has had a barium swallow and reports she has been asked to have an endoscopy as well.
She further mentions having occaional positive ANCA tests in past (when I was querying about her nasal sores).
The patient also mentions that all of her symptoms started in [**Month (only) **] after she developed an itchy foot rash that has cleared since the introduction of prednisone.
The patient underwent chest X-rat, chest CT, and then CTA after having an elevated d-dimer.
A short walk caused her systolic blood pressure to read in the 190s.
Past Medical History: BOOP/COP s/p Bx [**2172**] HTN HLD CAD s/p 3 stents GERD T2DM s/p knee replacement ([**2181**]) s/p TAH h/o proctitis ([**2177**]) h/o Babesiosis ([**2180**])   Social History: She is married and lives with her husband.
Family History: Significant for coronary artery disease.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VS - Temp 97.7F, BP 142/70, HR 59, R 18, O2-sat 100% 4L GENERAL - pleasant appropriate HEENT - NC/AT, EOMI, sclerae anicteric and without injection, MMM, OP clear NECK - supple, cannot evaluate JVD LUNGS - diffuse rales across all fields, denser at bases b/l.
Good air movement, no wheeze or rhonchi.
Becomes short of breath and RR increases to mid-20s on conversation.
Microbiology: [**2184-11-26**] MRSA SCREEN-PENDING [**2184-11-25**] CMV Viral Load-PENDING [**2184-11-25**] CRYPTOCOCCAL ANTIGEN-NEGATIVE [**2184-11-25**] Blood Culture-PENDING [**2184-11-25**] SPUTUM Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)-negative [**2184-11-24**] URINE CULTURE-PRELIMINARY {GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S)} [**2184-11-24**] BLOOD CULTURE-PENDING .
Imaging: CT Chest ([**11-24**]): IMPRESSION: Acute exacerbation of a more chronic fibrotic process with a segmental distribution.
- Coronary calcifications.
- There is calcification of the mitral annulus.
- Hiatal hernia.
Increased interstitial markings, correlating with the history of organizing pneumonia.
Increased bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis or potentially infection.
Findings compatible with known interstitial disease and inflammatory airways disease.
The only change is increased diffuse attenuation of lung parenchyma which may be due to differences in technique although superimposed processes such as edema are not excluded.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Echo ([**11-25**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal cavity size with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mildly dilated aortic arch.
No clinically significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Brief Hospital Course: 70F with PMH BOOP/COP, CAD s/p stent x3, PAD who presents with dyspnea on exertion, hypoxia, chest pressure of two months duration.
# Dyspnea, Hypoxia, Chest Pressure:  DDx is broad, including cardiac, pulmonary, and inflammatory causes.
Although the patient had Hx CAD, her chest pressure appeared to be mild and associated with hypoxia.
She had no sign of cardiac disease given negative troponin, normal echo.
Pulmonary hypertension would explain her dyspnea and hypoxia, although it could be secondary to multiple etiologies.
She could have worsening BOOP, but it was also possible she had a new pulmonary process, either infectious or inflammatory.
Given her use of steroids without ABX prophylaxis, PCP or other infection also needs to be considered.
She has been afebrile and without sputum production, but has noted cough and is on immune suppression.
Given the background of foot rash and nasal lesions, Wegener's was of concern.
ENT was called but biopsy deferred to resolution of infectious and rheumatologic workup.
On the morning of [**11-26**], she was found to have worsening hypoxia and was transferred to the MICU.
However, over a few days, the patient's respiratory status continued to decline, and she had an acute episode of prolonged desaturation for which she was intubated.
CT chest performed [**2184-12-3**] showed substantial worsening of her ILD.
Several attempts were made to wean her from the ventilator but failed due to hypoxia.
She also declined the option for a tracheostomy.
She became pulseless and was declared dead at 12:02 pm.
# UTI: Found to have dirty UA, Ucx growing out pan sensitive Klebs.
Patient does have history of renal artery stenosis with stenting.
# Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to recent increase in steroids, especially as patient is afebrile.
She remained afebrile prior to ICU transfer.
# Diabetes mellitus, type 2:   continued ISS, held metformin .
