He had a CXR which showed questionable aspiration pneumonia.
Toxicology screen was positive for cannabis but otherwise negative.
He had a CT chest/abdomen and pelvis which showed small bilateral dependent consolidations which may represent aspiration.

Pertinent Results: Labs from OSH: WBC 28.6, Hct: 45.5, Plts 266 (N: 80, B: 6, L: 6, M: 8) Na: 140, K: 3.8, Cl: 104, CO2: 27, BUN 26, Cr: 1.0, Glu: 122 ALT: 19, AST 40, AP: 48, TBili 0.8 UA: 100 glucose, ketones 15, negative nitrite, negative LE, positive WBCs, positive epithelial cells LP: Tube 4 0 WBC, 4 RBC, glucose 102, protein 35, gram stain negative, cultures negative at 1d, HSV pending Blood and Urine cultures negative at 1d  CT head: FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or vascular territorial infarction.
A small hypodensity at the right frontal lobe (2:20) reflects a lacunar infarct.
A small amount of asymmetric soft tissue swelling overlies the right orbit consistent with the provided history.
There is no fracture.
The included paranasal sinuses reveal an air-fluid level in the left frontal sinus as well as circumferential mucosal thickening at the maxillary sinuses and sphenoid sinuses and opacification of the ethmoid air cells bilaterally.
In addition, moderate amount of fluid is seen posteriorly in the nasopharynx, consistent with the intubation.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
CT C-spine: FINDINGS: There is no fracture or traumatic malalignment.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
Mild disc disease results in slight ventral thecal effacement at C2/3, C3/4, and most notably at C5/C6.
The included portions of the lung apices are notable for [**Hospital1 **]-apical subpleural blebs.
A moderate amount of secretions in the oro- and nasopharynx should be correlated to the need for possible suctioning.
A small amount of atherosclerotic calcification is seen at the bifurcation of the carotid arteries bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: No fracture or traumatic malalignment.
Note that if concern exists for intrathecal abnormalities.
There are bibasilar dependent consolidations, possibly representing foci of aspiration in this intubated patient with a nasogastric tube.
At perifissural nodule on the left (2:31) is 5x 4 mm.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
The heart is notable for atherosclerotic coronary arterial calcifications.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
There is no free gas or fluid in the abdomen.
Regional vascular structures reveal extensive atherosclerotic calcification along the aorta, in the absence of aneurysmal dilation.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
The colon is notable for scattered diverticulosis and moderate fecal load, without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Equivocal mural thickening is visualized at the ascending colon, most likely reflecting the appearance of the nondistended colon.
There is no free gas or fluid in the pelvis.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS FINDINGS: There is no suspicious sclerotic or lytic osseous lesion.
Minimal bibasilar consolidations seen dependently, possibly representing aspiration.
Right and left pulmonary nodules.
Followup to document progression or resolution of these findings is recommended with a dedicated CT of the chest in six months.
No evidence of abscess formation.
Atherosclerotic disease.
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage or infarction.
There is increased FLAIR hyperintensity within the sulci.
These findings are consistent with ventilation with high-concentration oxygen.
There are small hyperdense foci scattered in the periventricular white matter on FLAIR, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
There are small hyperintense foci within the left thalamus and the left pons on FLAIR and diffusion-weighted sequences.
No corresponding abnormalities are seen on ADC maps, indicative of a T2 shine-through artifact.
These findings are consistent with small perivascular spaces, small areas of encephalomalacia, or enhancement secondary to high concentration oxygen therapy.
There are no masses or mass effect.
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage or infarction.
CSF hyperintensity of the sulci on FLAIR sequences is non- specific and may indicative of high concentration oxygen therapy.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage or infarction.
Hyperintense foci within the left thalamus and left pons on FLAIR may represent perivascular spaces or focal encephalomalacia.
Following extubation he was initially confused with limitations in short term memory and disorientation, however his mental status improved through hospital day #2 and at the time of call out, he was close to his baseline per his wife.
The etiology of his mental status is unclear.
His imaging studies were negative for hemorrhage or stroke and he had a negative infectious workup.
He was found to have hypoglycemia to 40 upon presentation to the outside hospital, however his mental status did not clear with glucose.
Patient also said he had recently stopped drinking alcohol, and it was considered that this AMS may have represented a seizure and post-ictal state secondary to alcohol withdrawal vs. hyper or hypoglycemia.
He was treated with acyclovir 850mg IV q8hrs for possible HSV encephalitis.
Type I Diabetes:  Urinalysis demonstrated ketonuria on admission, but serum glucose, bicarbonate and pH were normal.
He experienced several episodes of hypertension to SBP of 190 with headache, and was given IV hydralazine.
Calcium Carbonate 500 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for indigestion.
No bacteria were found in your blood, urine or sputum to explain your confusion.
A blood test for Herpes Simplex Virus encephalitis was performed at [**Location (un) **], this test was negative but was not able to completely prove that you did not have Herpes Encephalitis.
You had some nausea and vomiting which was improved by controlling your acid.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have temperature greater than 101, shortness of breath, worsening difficulty with swallowing, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or any other symptoms that you are concerned about.
