CT HEAD [**7-29**]: FINDINGS: There is a subarachnoid hemorrhage seen overlying the left cerebral hemisphere.
There may also be a tiny right-sided subdural hematoma over the left frontal lobe (2:14) measuring only 1 mm in thickness.
There is no shift of midline structures.
However, the left lateral ventricle is slightly smaller than the right and there may be some mild mass effect on the side.
