Interventional radiology tagged red blood cell scan with attempted percutaneous ablation.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y/o male with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CKD stage III, COPD, chronic venostasis, systolic CHF (EF of 45%-50%) who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with several episodes of bright red blood per rectum.
He first noted some bleeding while he was on vacation in [**State 2748**] the day PTA.
He started having some abdominal discomfort overnight and went to the bathroom where he had an episode of bright red blood per rectum.
Later on the following day he had multiple other episodes of BRBPR and decided to return to [**State 350**] and presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
Of note he presented in [**Month (only) **] to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with a similar episode of lower GI bleed.
He had a colonsocpy on [**2175-11-18**] which showed persistent active bleeding with diffuse clots suggestive of diverticular bleed in the setting of anticoagulation with coumadin and was transferred to the intensive care unit.
Ultrasound of his internal jugular showed collapse suggestive of volume depletion.
History of lower GI bleed with recurrent diverticular bleed.
Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
Chronic venostasis.
Bilateral neuropathy from leg edema.
History of gastric polyp.
The pacemaker was placed due to atrial fibrillation and bradycardia.

Acute blood loss anemia 2  Diverticular bleeding 3.
Chronic systolic heart failure with EF 45%.
Hypertension 5.
Atrial Fibrillation s/p PPM     The patient presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] after experiencing a large lower GI bleed while gambling at a casino in [**Location (un) **].
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he continued to have painless rectal bleeding.
Surgical and GI services were consulted who recommended a tagged RBC scan which was notable for extravasation in the sigmoid.
IR attempted to percutaneously embolize the bleed, but could not find any bleeding during the procedure.
Of note, despite the recurrent bleeding he did not have any hemodynamic instability.
His bleeding ceased without intervention by hospital day 2 and his hematocrit remained stable for 4 consecutive days.
The patient never had any episodes of shortness of breath, chest pain, or reported palpitations.
Prior to discharge, an discussion was held with GI, the patient's primary care physician (Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]), outpatient cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and outpatient gastroenterologist (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 23804**]), and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] from general surgery about the option of surgical intervention for his diverticular disease and the need to weigh the risks of surgery, including possibility of total abdominal colectomy given degree of diverticular disease, bleeding on anticoagulation, and stroke off anticoagulation.
After hearing of the available options and the relative risks of each, the patient decided that he would like to hold on surgery and continue with anticoagulation to reduce his stroke risk.
He understood his persistent risk of bleeding and stated that should he re-bleed again, he would consider surgery more strongly.
Anticoagulation: discussion of risks vs. benefits in the setting of atrial fibrillation and 2 episodes of massive lower GI bleeds in the past year.
Stress testing for pre-operative risk stratification (arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] .
Massive lower gastrointestinal bleed 2.
Difuse diverticular disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted in the setting of massive painless, lower gastro-intestinal tract bleeding.
You were also found have a slightly increased INR at 3.2 (this is the value that in monitored while you are taking Coumadin) and you were given vitamin K. Having a high INR puts you at increased risk for bleeding.
Your bleeding resolved without further intervention.
There is no guarantee that you won't have additional episodes of re-bleeding.
It is important that you have your coumadin levels monitored by your primary care physician on [**Name Initial (PRE) **] very frequent basis to avoid over-anticoagulation.
If you experience any of the warning symptoms discussed above and listed below please call your primary care physician and go to the nearest emergency department.
