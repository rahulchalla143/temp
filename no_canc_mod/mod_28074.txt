female with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension who presents with one month of worsening exertional dyspnea.
She subsequently had increasing exertional dyspnea and she is now only able to walk 20 feet on level ground.
She also complains of increasing abdominal distention with some mild pain secondary to expanding ventral hernia but denies any nausea or vomitting.
She does have diarrhea which is at baseline secondary to epoprostenol therapy vs. scleroderma.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for exertional dyspnea above.
Otherwise there is no chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Skin: + stasis dermatitis, no ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2126-9-27**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2126-9-30**]):    NO GROWTH.
Peritoneal fluid:   NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**2126-9-19**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade maybe absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
The mitral and tricuspid inflows are difficult to assess in the presence of atrial fibrillation  [**2126-9-19**] Abdominal US Scans of the four quadrants of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate a large volume of ascites, which represents a distinct change from previous ultrasound scan of [**2125-10-4**] which showed no ascites.
The fluid is anechoic showing no signs of septations or exudative appearance.
CONCLUSION:  Large volume ascites including ascites within an umbilical hernia.
Hemodynamic assessment revealed severely elevated pulmonary arterial systolic pressures, with PASP 91 mmHg at baseline.
Moderate elevation of right-sided filling pressures, with RVEDP 15 mmHg.
Mild elevation of left-sided filling pressures, with LVEDP 13 mmHg.
Elevated PVR at 800 dynes-sec/cm5.
Drug therapy noted above entailed increasing flolan dose from 38 ng/kg/min to 41 mcg/kg/min, with resultant hemodynamic measurements noted above after 15 minutes at new dose.
Severe pulmonary hypertension 2.
Given the technical differences and lesser degree of inspiration, the diffuse centrilobular interstitial pulmonary abnormality is essentially stable.
Increased size of pericardial and pleural effusions, increased ascites, new findings of anasarca and interlobular septal thickening at the lung bases, all suggesting worsening volume overload.
Enlarged pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Moderate coronary atherosclerosis.
Aortic valve calcification.
[**2126-9-24**] Paracentesis, US guided IMPRESSION: Successful therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis with removal of 1.5 liters of ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 64 yo female with severe pulmonary hypertension (multiple etiology- CREST, diastolic heart failure), chronic atrial fibrillation, emphysema, diastolic heart failure, and large ventral abdominal hernia presents with exertional dyspnea.
# Pulmonary artery hypertension - The patient was continued on her sildenafil and epoprostenol.
She was taken to cardiac catheterization and was found to have elevated pressures in the right and left heart with equalization of diastolic pressures.
It was thought that she had cardiac tamponade but pericardiocentesis was not attempted as the pericardial effusion was posterior to the heart and the risk of an anterior approac outweighed any potential benefit.
Also, she was found to have a mildly depressed cardiac index to 2.3.
The patient's symptoms slightly improved with the increased dose and she tolerated it well.
Her dyspnea continued, and it was felt that this was partly due to her large volume ascites.
The patient had difficulty with orthopnea and early satiety.
It was felt that although the patient's overall hemodynamics had worsened, she may get improvement in her symptoms with a therapeutic paracentesis.
After her paracentesis, her symptoms markedly improved and she was discharged home on her regular home 6L O2 with good O2 saturations.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF - The patient's EF>55%.
The patient's ascites was likely due to right sided heart failure, mostly with a diastolic component but also worsened by her severe pulmonary hypertension.
This was consistent with culture negative neutrocytic ascites and she was treated with antiobiotics as recommended.
Her symptoms improved after paracentesis.
# Atrial fibrillation - The patient's rate was well-controlled on her digoxin dose.
# Diarrhea: A GI consult was called intially at admission since the patient has chronic diarrhea.
Currently it is unclear as to whether this is due to her epoprostenol (known to cause diarrhea), or to her CREST syndrome.
# Emphysema - Her emphysema and O2 requirement remained stable.
# GERD - The patient will continue her home dose of omeprazole.
# Communication - with patient and daughter who is HCP - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 70442**] .
The patient understood her situation, and her HCP was made aware of her clinical status and prognosis.
At discharge, her symptoms were improved and she was discharged in stable condition.
