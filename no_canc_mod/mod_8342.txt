Admission Date: [**2156-5-31**]        Discharge Date: [**2156-6-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2132-1-9**]        Sex:  M  Service:  MED   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 24-year-old male with type 1 diabetes complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, and end- stage renal disease currently on peritoneal dialysis, systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 15 percent as of [**2155-12-1**], hypertension, grade 2 esophagitis and multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis in the past, was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis.
He stated that it felt the same as his usual diabetic ketoacidosis.
He denied fever, chills, urinary frequency, dysuria, back pain, change in medications, chest pain, or decreased p.o.
He complained of abdominal pain and chronic loose stools.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 1 diabetes:  Diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and end-stage renal disease.
Frequent diabetic ketoacidosis admissions.
Nephrotic syndrome leading to end-stage renal disease.
Refractory hypertension on multiple blood pressure medications as outpatient.
Cardiomyopathy diagnosed in [**3-/2154**] secondary to hypertension.
Mother has diabetes status post CABG on peritoneal dialysis, father with hypothyroidism.
In addition, he had increased LFTs with an ALT of 899 and AST of 1650.
Patient had episodes of coffee-ground emesis, but did not permit nasogastric tube lavage.
Examination is significant for young thin white male, who appears anxious with moderate respiratory distress.
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation without rales or wheezes.
Abdomen is soft, but slightly distended with well-healed scars.
PD catheter site nonerythematous with no exudate.
Extremities: 2 plus pitting edema bilaterally.
Total bilirubin slightly elevated at 0.6.
X-RAY:  Chest x-ray with stable cardiomegaly, normal pulmonary vasculature with no pneumonia or fluid overload.
EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute with normal axis, old Q waves in III, left ventricular hypertrophy, old ST elevations in V2 and V3.
New T-wave inversions in V5 with ST depression less than 1 mm, slight decrease in previous T- wave inversion in V6, pseudonormalization of T-wave inversion in I and V6.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed patent vessels, small amount of free intraperitoneal fluid, prominent gallbladder filled with sludge without evidence of cholecystitis and a right sided pleural effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 24-year-old white male with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes complicated by end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, who was admitted with diabetic cardiomyopathy and found to have an upper GI bleed, transaminitis, malignant hypertension, and demand ischemia.
Although initial chest x-ray did not reveal CHF, it is likely that patient developed CHF in the setting of his lower ejection fraction of 15 percent.
Transaminitis:  It is unclear of why the patient had elevated amylase and lipase on admission.
It may be secondary to hepatic congestion from CHF.
Hepatic serologies were negative except for a positive hepatitis A antibody.
In addition, once diabetic ketoacidosis resolved, the patient did not have further abdominal pain.
Upon discharge, he continued to have erratic control of his glucose levels with episodes of hypoglycemia and critically high levels.
Patient declined multiple blood draws, but a few days prior to discharge, his anion gap was within the normal range.
He was symptomatic with blurry vision.
Initially the fear was giving him IV repletion may increase his chances redeveloping his diabetic ketoacidosis.
However, IV treatment was needed and he received 1.5 amp of D50 with resolution of his symptoms and normalization of his serum glucose.
ID:  On admission, the patient had a questionable opacity on his right lower lobe on chest x-ray, however, this was a limited exam because it was a portable.
The patient remained afebrile until a few days prior to discharge at which time his white blood cell count slightly increased and he had temperatures greater than 101.5.
Patient declined multiple blood draws for cultures.
Showed no PMNs, no microorganisms, and no growth on culture.
Left lower calf pain:  The patient complained of pain on admission.
A MRI of the lower extremity revealed diffuse abnormal enhancement most pronounced in the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle.
No drainable fluid was identified, although there was a thin sheath of fluid between the lateral head of the gastrocnemius and the soleus muscle.
High blood pressure:  Initially, patient had malignant hypertension with evidence of demand ischemia.
CHF:  The patient has a low EF at baseline.
During his hospitalization, he was started on spironolactone after discussion with his primary cardiologist.
This revealed reflux esophagitis and bile reflux.
Patient declined multiple blood tests and interventions.
He had an increasing white blood cell count and he continued to have high temperatures without a known source.
The primary team was no longer in house, but the covering intern came in and explained to the patient that it was important for him to stay because of his fevers, and we did not know what the source of his infection.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Esophageal reflux.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
RECOMMENDED FOLLOWUP:  Follow up with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Diabetes Center, and Renal physician as soon as possible.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Call with fevers, persistent nausea and vomiting, spitting up blood, or any concerning symptoms.
