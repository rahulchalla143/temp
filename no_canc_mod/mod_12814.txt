Per report of patient's wife, patient ate chili at 1pm on the day prior to admission, and developed epigastric pain directly after.
He had ongoing sharp pain which radiated to his back and not related to position.
He did not have fever, chills or night sweats.
He did have elevated blood sugars in the days prior to admission.
He has never had biliary colic, cholecystitis or pancreatitis in the past.
RUQ ultrasound revealed multiple stones within distended gallbladder, c/w acute cholecystitis, with common bile duct dilation to 1.3cm without identification of an intra-ductal stone.
Following intubation, patient was tachycardic and hypertensive.
He was difficult to ventilate and so was sedated and paralyzed and given albuterol with improved compliance and tidal volumes.
During ERCP, many gallstones were removed from the biliary tree which were partially obstructive.
Patient was hypertensive and tachycardic after, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] intubated.

Imaging: CXR [**2156-12-11**]: IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes without radiographic evidence for acute process.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms.
Findings consistent with acute cholecystitis.
Dilatation of the common duct, measuring up to 13 mm, suggests the presence of a distal CBD stone.
Small hepatic lobe hypodensities are incompletely characterized and should be further evaluated with MR. 4.
Echogenic liver, most consistent with fat deposition, although more advanced disease such as cirrhosis and/or fibrosis cannot be excluded.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
The procedure was mildly difficult.
Many round stones ranging in size from 5 mm to 10 mm that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the biliary tree.
IMPRESSION: Mild post obstructive dilation was noted.
Bulging of the major papilla Successful cannulation of the bile duct (cannulation) Many round stones ranging in size from 5 mm to 10 mm that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the biliary tree.
Mild post obstructive dilation was noted.
Multiple stones and pus were extracted successfully using a balloon catheter.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum .
IMPRESSION: No DVT in the left lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 y/o M with a history of HTN, HL, DMII, obesity and asthma presenting with gallstone pancreatitis and possible cholangitis with ERCP c/b hypoxic respiratory distress requiring intubation.
# Acute cholecystitis complicated by gallstone pancreatitis and cholangitis- Patient presented with several days of RUQ pain worse with food and was found to have acute cholecystitis complicated by pancreatitis.
Tbili, transaminases and lipase all elevated on presentation.
Following the procedure, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable without signs of sepsis.
# Hypoxic respiratory distress- Patient desaturated under sedation likely due to obesity and potential underlying obesity hypoventilation syndrome vs obstruction.
The patient had asthma so he likely had bronchoconstriction that also worsened oxygenation.
# Hypertension- Patient's blood pressure elevated on arrival to ICU.
# Diabetes mellitus type II- Patient followed at [**Last Name (un) **] for diabetes.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: gallstone pancreatitis cholangitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
An ultrasound found gallstones, and lab work showed signs of pancreatitis.
Following the ERCP, you had difficulty breathing on your own and were intubated.
As you improved, you were able to eat normally without pain and your fever resolved.
Please ask him to do a pre-operative evaluation for your expected surgery.
Fatty foods increase the probability of a gallstone attack and can worsen pancreatitis.
