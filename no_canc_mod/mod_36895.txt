Small left pleural effusion.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an echogenic density in the right ventricle consistent with an AICD lead.
Slight lucency is seen along the cortical irregularity of the proximal fifth phalanx which may represent residua of prior injury but an acute hairline fracture cannot be excluded.
Clinical correlation to the patient's site of pain is recommended.
No further analysis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2164-10-19**] for elective surgical management of his coronary artery and mitral valve disease.
Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] developed respiratory distress and was reintubated.
Lasix was given intravenously for pulmonary edema and natrecor was started.
He underwent CVVH to assist with fluid management.
Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] complained of right 5th digit pain and an x-ray was obtained.
This revealed a fracture and a splint was applied.
An ace inhibitor was started given his low ejection fraction.
Acute renal failure was suspected in the setting of an ace inhibitor, diuretics and dehydration.
His foley was removed and a flomax was started for some frequency, hesitancy and urgency with good relief.
Vitamin K was also given as he developed a nose bleed.
His room air saturations were 98% and his discharge x-ray was only notable for a very small left pleural effusion.
