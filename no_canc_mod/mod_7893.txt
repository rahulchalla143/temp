He had a total of approximately six episodes that was always elicited by exerted and palliated by stopping his activity.
Pain is described as being nonradiating, substernal in nature associated with occasional shortness of breath.
He denied any nausea, vomiting or palpitations.
Because of the significant disease seen on catheterization he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2174-12-24**]  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Gastroesophageal reflux disease, osteoarthritis and urge incontinence and benign prostatic hypertrophy.
His total cholesterol is 200 and he has never been treated for hypercholesterolemia.
He has no known drug allergies.
He does have a very strong family history for coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on examination: 98.1, blood pressure was 134/76, heart rate was 67 in sinus, no acute distress.
Mucous membranes were moist, trachea is midline, no carotid bruit.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2, no murmur, rub or gallop.
Abdomen was benign, positive bowel sounds auscultated.
Extremities had no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis, edema or calf tenderness.
He had slight varicose veins on the right lower extremity, palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
He was admitted to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for preoperative coronary artery bypass graft.
It should be noted that the patient had admission electrocardiogram which shows normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST and T wave change.
Cardiac catheterization at outside hospital showed significant left main disease and therefore coronary artery bypass graft was planned.
His pericardium was left open as well as having a right radial arterial line, a Swan Ganz catheter in the right internal jugular position as well two ventricular and one atrial wires for external pacing, two mediastinal and one left pleural were also placed intra-operatively.
On the night of postoperative day #2, however, he went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
After being in atrial fibrillation for approximately ten hours he broke into sinus rhythm and was rate controlled with beta blockade and amiodarone.
Chest x-ray after chest tube removal just shows bilateral plate like atelectasis with no evidence of pneumothorax.
He had no erythema, no exudate.
His lungs were clear with decreased breath sounds at the bases.
His lower extremities were warm and well perfused with palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial bilaterally.
