The patient is status post left anterior descending interventions, i.e., repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the past, who was referred for a cardiac catheterization due to recurrent exertional chest pain.
The patient is a 48-year-old diabetic patient who reported new onset of exertional chest discomfort and shortness of breath in [**2124-2-17**].
He underwent an exercise treadmill test on [**2124-7-12**], which revealed that, after five minutes of exercise on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol, he complained of shortness of breath, calf claudication, and had significant electrocardiogram changes.
He did have at that time some mild chest pain as well.
Electrocardiogram had inferolateral ST changes.
On [**2124-7-18**], he had cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 190**], where he was found to have an 80% ostial left anterior descending lesion.
There was no other obstructive disease, however.
In [**2124-11-16**], he was taken back to the catheterization laboratory because of recurrent exertional symptoms and anteroseptal ischemia on his exercise treadmill after four minutes of exercise.
Other angiography revealed diffuse disease in the distal left anterior descending up to 80% after the origin of the D2.
The circumflex had a minor disease, and the origin of the RPDA had a 70% stenosis.
In [**2125-6-16**], he underwent another re-look catheterization because of again anteroseptal and apical ischemia noted on his surveillance treadmill test.
He was found to have a 90% restenosis of the left anterior descending stent, along with a 40% lesion distal to the stent margin.
The RPDA had a 70% lesion as well.
Ov[**Last Name (STitle) 35337**] past several weeks, however, the patient has developed recurrent angina and it was occurring with walking short distances, and occasionally when exercising, although in most cases he was able to bike 30 to 45 minutes on a stationary bike and feel "well."
On admission, he denied claudication, no orthopnea, no edema, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no lightheadedness.
Coronary artery disease risk factor profile included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for depression, coronary artery disease status post multiple left anterior descending interventions outlined above.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for tonsillectomy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He ultimately underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2125-11-8**] showing severe in-stent restenosis in the ostial left anterior descending stent, as well as moderate left circumflex and posterior descending artery disease, with low normal left ventricular ejection fraction, estimated to be 40 to 50%.
He had atrial pacing wires.
He did have some low-grade temperatures to 100.3, which were felt to be secondary to pulmonary toileting issues.
He had no carotid bruits.
The lungs were clear but decreased at the bases, no crackles.
His wound was stable.
Otherwise his dressings on the inferior portion of the wound were clean, dry and intact.
His lower extremities were warm and well perfused, with no edema.
