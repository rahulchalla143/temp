The prior obstetrical history was notable for spontaneous abortions x 2 and 1 full term delivery.
Expected date of confinement for this pregnancy was [**2106-7-11**] by 22 week ultrasound.
She had type 2 diabetes for 3 years, became insulin dependent with this pregnancy.
She had a bulging bag of water, was on bedrest, and had preterm rupture of membranes on [**2106-3-25**].
She was taken to cesarean section for breech presentation.
General - Nondysmorphic preterm female, skin bruising on right arm, left anterior thorax and lumbosacral spine.
Slightly coarse.
Abdomen soft, with no organomegaly.
Neurological - Tone excellent for gestational age.
On #3, she started    experiencing some respiratory acidosis and required    increasing ventilator settings.
She had a brief trial on    CPAP and required reintubation for apnea and increased    work of breathing.
At the time of discharge, she will be    free of apnea and bradycardia for greater than 5 days.
She was noted to    have a murmur on day of life 3 into 4 due to intractable    metabolic acidosis.
An echocardiogram was obtained, which    showed a small patent ductus arteriosus with left-to-right    flow.
A repeat echocardiogram on [**4-1**]    showed a persistent patent ductus arteriosus, and she    received a second course of indomethacin.
She had 1 additional ultrasound on [**4-20**],    which showed no patent ductus arteriosus.
There is a soft intermittent murmur thought to be    related to PPS, persistent pulmonary stenosis.
Enteral feedings were introduced on day of life 8 after    her patent ductus arteriosus was deemed no longer an    issue.
Due to symptoms of reflux, the baby was started on Zantac and    Reglan.
Both were discontinued on [**6-28**] without significant    recurrence of reflux symptoms.
[**Known lastname **] required treatment for    unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy, with a    peak serum bilirubin on day of life 3 of 4.0/0.6 mg/dl    direct.
Due to her prematurity, with unknown group    B streptococcus status, [**Known lastname **] was evaluated for sepsis at    time of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.
On [**4-16**], she was found to    have a very swollen and tender right elbow, with limited    joint mobility, and concerns for possible septic    arthritis.
She also had a fever to 101 degrees at that    time.
ESR was    elevated at 60 (normal range 0-20) and C-reactive protein was    elevated at greater than 30, with a high suspicion range    greater than 0.3.
She also had further surveillance studies, including a    lumbar puncture which was negative, weekly CBCs and LFTs,    which remained ultimately within normal limits, a head    ultrasound on [**4-20**] which was within normal limits, and an    ECHO which did not show any cardiac vegetations.
Last HUS on [**6-22**], at 37 wks    corrected age, did reveal minimally enlarged ventricles, but    overall within normal limits without evidence of hemorrhage or    PVL.
Audiology - Hearing screening was performed with    automated auditory brainstem response.
Subsequent genetic testing    at Ambry Genetics ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 60434**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60435**]) confirmed    that patient is a cystic fibrosis carrier with one identified    mutation.
2) Born between 32-35 weeks    with two of the following:  day care during RSV season, a    smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway    abnormalities or school age siblings.
Before    this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life,    immunization against influenza is recommended for household    contacts and out of home caregivers.
Former 24 [**7-13**] week premature female status post    respiratory distress syndrome with now chronic lung    disease.
Status post Staph aureus bacteremia.
Status post osteomyelitis of the right humerus and ulna.
Status post apnea of prematurity, anemia of prematurity.
Status post unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
Cystic fibrosis carrier.
Retinopathy of prematurity.
