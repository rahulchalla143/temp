Admission Date:  [**2129-12-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2129-12-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2129-12-22**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEONATOLOGY  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby girl [**Known lastname 54473**] is a 37 week infant admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit for respiratory distress and evaluation of dysmorphic features.
The mother has a history of hypertension, although blood pressures performed during pregnancy were normal and there was no sign of PIH.
The mother was also evaluated during pregnancy due to a family history of Marfan's syndrome.
An echocardiogram was performed and was normal with no evidence of aortic root abnormalities.
The mother also has a history of cardiac palpitations with no clear etiology, as well as asthma for which she was treated with Advair and Proventil during pregnancy.
Rupture of membranes was greater than 24 hours, and there was a maternal fever of 102.
The infant emerged and required several minutes of positive pressure ventilation due to poor respiratory effort.
She then had persistent respiratory distress.
The infant was admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit for respiratory distress and evaluation of dysmorphic features.
General: Active infant with mild respiratory distress.
HEENT:  Dysmorphic facies, notable for hypertelorism, slanting palpebral fissures, sloping forehead, and flat occiput.
Nasal bridge was also flat with tented nostrils.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, no organomegaly.
RESPIRATORY:  The infant had initial tachypnea which resolved without therapy.
B.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The infant has been hemodynamically stable without evidence of structural heart disease.
D.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The infant has mild facial jaundice today, day of life number one.
E.  HEMATOLOGY:  The infant had an initial CBC with a white count of 22, hematocrit 50%, platelets 408,000 with a benign differential.
F.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The infant had risk factors for sepsis including maternal fever of 102 and rupture of membranes greater than 24 hours.
The infant, however, did not show any signs of sepsis and had a benign CBC.
She also underwent further evaluation given the question of genetic syndrome including, head MRI normal, renal ultrasound normal, upper GI to rule out malrotation normal, ophthalmologic examination normal, and head ultrasound normal.
The infant does have increased tone in the upper extremities which will need to be followed.
Dysmorphic features, rule out genetic disorder.
