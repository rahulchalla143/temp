Admission Date:  [**2103-9-15**]       Discharge Date:   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 81-year-old woman with a past medical history of dermatomyositis on chronic steroids, and hypertension, who was transferred from [**Hospital6 3622**] on [**2103-9-15**], after presenting with chest pain radiating to the left arm, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and malaise.
She then demonstrated a non-Q wave myocardial infarction with CPK greater than 1100, and troponin-T of .82.
She underwent echocardiogram and catheterization, which showed three vessel disease with 50 to 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending, and 95% stenosis in the D1, 50% stenosis of the circ, 80% stenosis of the obtuse marginal I, 90% stenosis of the obtuse marginal II, an ejection fraction of 65%, and 4+ mitral regurgitation.
She additionally had been found to be in atrial flutter at the outside hospital, and was started on a Diltiazem drip as well as heparin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Significant for dermatomyositis, on chronic prednisone, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, macular degeneration, status post colectomy, status post cholecystectomy, status post right total hip replacement, and depression.
ALLERGIES:   She was admitted with no known drug allergies, but subsequently developed a poor tolerance for morphine, which caused confusion and hallucinations.
Her lungs had minimal crackles bilaterally.
The heart was tachycardic and regular.
Additionally, she continued to have atrial flutter, for which she was started on Lopressor and amiodarone, and her heparin drip was continued.
She additionally had a urinary tract infection, for which she was treated with Cipro for three days.
Postoperatively, she was extubated on [**9-18**], however, she required reintubation on [**9-20**] secondary to pulmonary secretions and respiratory distress.
On [**9-21**], she underwent a repeat catheterization, which showed her grafts to be patent, her mitral regurgitation to be decreased to 1 to 2+, and an ejection fraction of 50%.
She was again extubated on [**9-22**], and underwent a swallowing study on [**9-25**], which was positive for aspiration.
The patient was noted to have bloody stools on [**9-26**], and her heparin was discontinued.
On [**9-29**], she continued to have bloody bowel movements, and she was lavaged, which was clear.
On [**9-30**], a Rheumatology consultation was obtained, which concluded that the patient was not having a flare of her dermatomyositis, and she was switched to Solu-Medrol 8 mg intravenously twice a day.
On [**10-1**], the patient's Flagyl was discontinued, given low suspicion for anaerobic infection.
On [**10-3**], the patient had had recurrent atrial flutter, and she underwent DC cardioversion, which was successful.
After receiving approximately two weeks of 400 mg by mouth twice a day, the patient was decreased to 400 mg by mouth once daily, which was ultimately reduced to 200 mg once daily after approximately ten days due to bradycardia.
On [**10-5**], the patient was noted to have again a rising white blood cell count.
She underwent a thoracentesis on the 16th, where 300 cc of serous fluid was removed.
Prior to the thoracentesis, she had a chest CT which showed multilobar pneumonia, large effusions, consolidation in multiple lobes, bilateral lower lobe collapse.
Additionally, the patient was noted to have vesicles throughout the right main stem bronchus area, which was felt to be possibly a chemical irritation vs. possible infectious etiology.
Specimens were sent to the Laboratory, which showed cultures all negative at the time of this dictation, and pathology of the biopsy taken during the bronchoscopy showed squamous metaplasia and acute inflammation.
Additionally, she was noted to have bloody pulmonary secretions.
Because of this and her recent history of gastritis with bloody stools, and the fact that she was now in normal sinus rhythm, the patient's anticoagulation was held.
A chest x-ray on [**10-11**] raised a question of a possible area of aerated lung vs. cavity, and the patient underwent repeat CT scan on [**10-12**], which revealed no abscess, but pockets of aerated lung.
The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and, as noted above, her amiodarone was decreased to 200 mg by mouth once daily secondary to bradycardia.
She was continued on her lasix and afterload reducing agents as well as the rest of her antihypertensive medications.
She was continued on Zosyn for her pneumonia, with the last day, per Infectious Disease consult service, to be [**10-13**].
The patient has been maintained on trach mask and FIO2 of 0.4, with very acceptable saturations, and significant improvement in her  pulmonary secretions.
