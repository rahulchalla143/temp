He also had VPS placement during that admission for hydrocephalus.
He was started on warfarin for bilateral DVTs and had a fall at rehab.
CT head demonstrated left acute subdural hematoma.
At the rehab facility he had complained of right head pain but per them seemed to be at his usual neurological baseline.
CT showed a left sided acute SDH with midline shift and edema.
He progresively declined such that he would initially groan and intermittently follow commands and latterly at the time of my assessment became unresponsive to sternal rub preceded by fidgety movements of the hands and latterluy extensor posturing in the UE with GCS 4 E1 V1 M2.
HE also had a hypertensive spiek with HR stable/borderlien bradycardic and SBP 190s -200s.
He was intubated in the ED and repeat scan showed a possible bleeding vessel with considerable enlargememnt in the ASDH and worse midline shift.
Given worsening in scan and clinical status, he was tarnsferred directly to teh OR for an emergent left craniotomy and clot evacuation.

[**2142-1-5**] CXR In comparison with the study of [**1-4**], the tracheostomy tube remains in place and there is pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
There is the suggestion of some vague  opacification in the retrocardiac region that could represent some atelectatic changes.
Mild fullness of pulmonary central vessels raises the possibility of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
[**2142-1-5**] LENS DVT involving bilateral CFV, left proximal SFV, and one of the left PTV's.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken emergently from the ER to the Operating Room for evacuation of enlarging acute SDH.
On POD2 the patient underwent placement of IVC filter as he cannot be anticoagulated given his acute SDH evacuation and multiple falls.
Post-procedure the patient had multiple episodes of seizure activity involving right arm rhythmic jerking and right facial twitching that resolved with Dilantin 300mg IV and ativan 2mg IV.
On POD3 [**12-5**] the patient was placed on continuous EEG monitering which showed frequent seizures in the setting of corrected dilantin level > 10, that did not resolve with dilantin boluses.
His EEG monitoring continued and was negative for active seizures.
EEG was again negative for seizures on current regimen.
On [**12-10**] the patient's mental status continued to be depressed with a minimal exam and so he underwent an MRI of the brain to assess for the possibility of new strokes.
MRI was stable and did not show new strokes.
His BAL from [**12-13**] grew coag + staph aureus and enterobacter so ancef was d/c'd and changed to vanc/cefepime/cipro.
On [**12-17**] he was noted to have some ?
On the morning of 11.7 he was noted to have probable seizure activity evidenced by twitching of the right eye and mouth.
later on he developed LUE and left facial twitching and was given ativan.
His exam was stable and he had no seizures overnight into [**12-19**].
On [**12-21**] his dilantin level was corrected to 10 so he was bolused and given an increased dose.
Also LENI's were performed for routine monitoring and was consistent with deep vein thrombosis again seen in one of the two posterior tibial veins in the left calf.
Neurology recommended an MRI to evaluate the patient for possible worsening infarct which might be a source of the EEG findings.
On Exam, the patient was intubated, there was no eye opening, pupils were equal and reactive, the patient localized to noxious in the left upper extremity.
The patient exhibits minimal withdrawal in the right upper and left upper extremity.
A chest xray was performed which showed improvement in atelectasis and consolidation.
Also his EEG's for [**12-26**], [**12-27**], and [**12-28**] were reviewed and all showed moderate to severe encephalopathy but there were no electrographic seizures.
On [**12-31**] he was noted to have developed hematuria in the evening and urology was consulted to assist in management.
there was a question of traumatic foley palcement versus urethral erosion.
He had continuous bladder irrigation and his urine cleared.
He was started on empiric antibiotics for pneumonia as the patient continued to have copious secretions.
He continued to have epsiodes of fevers on [**1-2**] while on triple antibiotics.
Now DOD, he is afebrile VSS, he is neurologically stable.
