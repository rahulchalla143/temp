There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%) with visually-significant intraventricular dyssynchrony.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The degree of mitral regurgitation seen is normal for this prosthesis.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mild global biventricular systolic dysfunction with evidence of hemodynamic RV/LV interdependence.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Amiodarone was started for episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation.
Postoperatively he had brief episodes of transient atrial fibrillation treated with beta-blocker.
He remained afebrile and cultures remained negative.
Target INR 3.0-3.5 for mechanical valves.
