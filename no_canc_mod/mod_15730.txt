Admission Date:  [**2112-10-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2112-11-4**]   Service:  THORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and mitral regurgitation requiring a coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve replacement in [**2110**] who had a complicated recovery since the surgery with pneumonia and a history of intubation and tracheostomy.
The patient was complaining of progressive dyspnea since his recovery from the cardiac surgery and was evaluated with a CAT scan in [**2111-7-13**] and was found to have high tracheal stenosis at the level of the thoracic inlet with the lumen approximately 7 mm in diameter.
Coronary artery disease, status post CABG and MVR in [**2110**].
History of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
History of left atrial clot for which the patient has been taking Coumadin.
Obstructive sleep apnea requiring CPAP.
History of hip fracture, status post surgical repair.
History of fall with recent subdural hemorrhage which is stable.
History of seizure disorder.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
Pulmonary function testing done on [**2112-8-5**] with moderate to restrictive impairment with decreased FVC and FEV1 and normal FEV1/FVC.
Transthoracic echocardiogram done on [**2112-10-7**] showed left atrium mildly dilated with an abnormal shadowing echodensity in the posterior portion consistent with a clot, moderate to severely reduced global left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 20-25% consistent with his history of MI, coronary artery disease, status post CABG.
Chest CT done on [**2112-10-5**] showed a small subdural hemorrhage along the right tentorium, cerebellum, without mass affect, small right frontal and parietal infarcted areas were noted.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The patient was afebrile with a temperature of 96.7, heart rate 78, blood pressure 120/64, respiratory rate 20, saturating at 96% on room air.
Neck:  Supple, nontender, no bruits noted.
Cardiovascular:  Irregularly/irregular heart rate, no audible murmurs.
Abdomen:  Bowel sounds soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.
Extremities:  No edema with good palpable dorsalis pedis pulses.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a flexible bronchoscopy with Interventional Pulmonology and was found to have severe obstruction at the proximal trachea and was admitted for further observation and management.
Because of his subtherapeutic anticoagulation, the patient was started on a heparin drip with a goal to titrate up to PTT of 60-80.
There were no absolute contraindications to anticoagulation from their point of view.
Cardiology consult was also called for preoperative evaluation and it was felt that there was no evidence of ongoing ischemia or severe decompensation of heart failure at this time.
The patient still has moderate to high risk of perioperative cardiac event.
Because of the severe tracheal stenosis and danger of airway obstruction, the patient was admitted to the MICU for observation prior to surgery.
At the time, Mr. [**Known lastname 50980**] and his family said that they did not want a tracheostomy nor did they want a T tube and stated that he would prefer to die than to have those procedures.
Therefore, the patient was recommended a tracheal resection and reconstruction or a bronchoscopic procedure.
However, this procedure was aborted due to the inability to establish with any degree of certainty that the anastomosis would be due without any undue tension.
The patient went ahead with the alternative plan for a bronchoscopic approach and underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with dilatation and stent of the proximal tracheal stenosis on [**2112-10-31**] by Interventional Pulmonology.
On postoperative day number one, the patient was complaining of difficulty swallowing.
Given his prior history of CVA and dysphagia, Speech and Swallow consult was called.
The initial evaluation was that the patient did not demonstrate any overt signs or symptoms of aspiration.
The patient went ahead with a video swallow study.
On video swallow study, the patient demonstrated aspiration with nectar-thick liquids and thin liquids and the patient was initially placed on n.p.o.
However, after an extensive discussion with the Interventional Pulmonology Team and with the patient, it was clear that this was not an acute process given his history of CVA and his history of dysphagia and given the fact that the patient was only a few days out from surgery that these findings may be transiently related to postoperative recovery.
With the patient's insistence on starting on a pureed diet which he had been taking prior to admission and with full understanding of risks of aspiration and pneumonia as explained by the staff to the patient, the patient was cautiously started on a pureed diet.
The patient tolerated a pureed diet without signs or symptoms of aspiration.
12 hours for full anticoagulant effect while he continued his anticoagulation with p.o.
Coronary artery disease, status post CABG and mitral valve replacement.
Atrial fibrillation.
History of left atrial clot.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Dysphagia and aspiration possibly secondary to past cerebrovascular accident, possibly worsened by postoperative recovery.
The patient is also to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within two weeks for future discussions and plans for his tracheal stenosis and can follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in his office as needed.
