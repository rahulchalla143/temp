No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2185-1-29**] FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates diffuse increase in echogenicity, consistent with fatty infiltration.
However, other forms of liver disease are not excluded.
No focal liver lesions or biliary dilatation is seen.
No hydronephrosis, stones, or renal masses are seen.
The spleen is mildly enlarged measuring 16.1 cm.
There is normal arterial waveform with sharp systolic upstroke and mildly decreased diastolic flow.
Echogenic liver, consistent with fatty infiltration.
However, other forms of liver disease including advanced liver disease or cirrhosis is not excluded.
Mild splenomegaly.
Normal sized kidneys, without evidence of hydronephrosis or renal artery stenosis.
[**2185-1-28**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, and calf veins were obtained.
There is occlusive thrombus originating at the junction of the left common femoral vein and greater saphenous vein extending inferiorly to involve the entire left superficial femoral and left popliteal veins.
Occlusive thrombus extending from the left common femoral vein to the popliteal vein.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 67 yo man with history of LLE DVT presents with new LLE DVT, newly found PE, and RV thrombus, s/p thrombectomy, thrombolysis, and IVF placement, complicated by acute renal failure.
# DVT/ PE/RV thrombus: The patient was transferred from an OSH after being found to have a PE and small RV thrombus while on lovenox and coumadin for a femoral and popliteal vein DVT that he had developed on [**1-21**], about a week earlier.
It is unclear whether he had already had a PE and RV thrombus or whether this developed while on anticoagulation.
There was no precipitating event for the DVT and this is second time he has had a DVT.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he underwent thrombectomy/lysis of the femoral DVT and had a temporary IVC filter placement.
An echo was performed which showed no intervenable clot in the heart and although there was RV dilation, there was no evidence of strain.
He was initially start on warfarin 5mg daily, but became supratherapeutic, and so warfarin was held and was restarted on 3mg daily.
He became suprtherapeutic on 3mg daily and so again warfarin was held and he was then started on 2mg daily at discharge.
# Acute renal failure: The patient Cr rose from 0.9 to 4.1 over 3 days post thrombectomy and IVC filter placement.
# Diarrhea: The patient presented with watery diarrhea and was emperically placed on norovirus precautions.
# Deranged LFTs: The patient presented with elevated LFT.
# CAD s/p LAD stents:  He was chest pain free throughout his hospital stay.
# HTN - Continued metoprolol and losartan .
# HLD  - Continued zocor .
# DM II- ISS in house, and he was not restarted on metformin at discharge (his home medication).
# GERD: He complained of GERD and diarrhea symptoms, which were felt to be from a viral gastroenteritis or norovirus.
He was instructed to follow up with his GI specialist for further management of his symptoms.
Given his thrombotic history and his worsening abdominal pain, a repeat EGD is likely warranted.
# BPH: continue Flomax .
Deep venous thrombosis of the left leg 2.
Pulmonary embolism 3. status post mechanical thrombectomy and thrombolysis 4. status post IVC filter placement 5.
You were also noted to have a small blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolus) and maybe one in the right ventricle of your heart.
You had an IVC filter placed, which will prevent clots from moving from your legs to your lungs.
You had an echo performed, which showed no intervenable clot in the heart.
Your hospital stay was complicated by acute kidney injury, which was likely in the setting of IV dye administration.
You also had mild GERD and diarrhea symptoms, which were felt to be from a viral gastroenteritis or norovirus.
MEDICATION CHANGES: - Decrease warfarin to 2mg daily over the weekend to prevent the blood clot in your leg from getting worse.
- STOP taking Plavix, metformin, glyburide, losartan and lovenox - START taking ranitidine to help your stomach and GERD .
