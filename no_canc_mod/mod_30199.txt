Admission Date:  [**2180-5-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2180-5-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2106-1-11**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old white male with a history of hemophilia A and HIV, who arrived at the emergency room with symptomatic bradycardia progressing to asystole.
Of note, the patient had recent antiretroviral medication changes, including the development of lactic acidosis on stavudine, which was discontinued by his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Otherwise, the patient was in his usual state of health with no other specific complaints until the morning of admission, when he developed abdominal discomfort at approximately 10:30 followed by a loose bowel movement.
This progressed to generalized weakness, dyspnea and diaphoresis, which caused him to present to the emergency department.
In the emergency department, the patient was noted to be in a junctional rhythm and then had worsening bradycardia to a heart rate of 25, which caused him to become asystolic.
He had a history of supraventricular tachycardia, status post ablation in [**2179-6-26**].
He had a lower gastrointestinal bleed, possibly secondary to internal hemorrhoids in [**2179-10-27**].
He had a varicella-zoster virus infection in [**2180-1-27**].
The patient also had a history of hepatitis A, hepatitis B positive, hepatitis C positive, porphyria cutanea tarda, migraine headaches and a history of lactic acidosis to protease inhibitors.
In general, the patient was sedated and somewhat confused with nonsensical speech but alert and oriented times three upon occasion.
The head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, revealed no icterus or pallor.
The cardiovascular examination was a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen was soft, nontender and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
There was a pacemaker wire in the right groin with no hematoma or bleeding.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Electrocardiogram #1 showed a junctional escape rhythm at 40 beats per minute with normal axis and intervals and no acute ST or T wave changes.
Electrocardiogram #2, after the pacemaker was placed, showed a left bundle branch pattern with paced rhythm at approximately 40 beats per minute.
The only concerning feature was that the patient became quite hyperkalemic to a value of 7.2 with a repeat value of 6.9 and had decreased urine output.
The transvenous pacing wires were removed without event on [**2180-5-12**] and the patient was monitored in the intensive care unit throughout his last night of hospitalization for consideration of bleeding and possible recurrence of arrhythmia.
These were to be considered as an outpatient only, as the patient was to follow up with the electrophysiology service for further management of his history of supraventricular tachycardia in the setting of likely overdose or over-medication causing his recent junctional rhythm and bradycardia.
Hepatitis C positive.
