A cerebral angiogram was performed here which did not reveal any evidence of an aneurysm.
The patient remained in the intensive care unit because of his atraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.

On [**11-22**], the patient was found to have a left basilic vein thrombosis.
Mr. [**Known lastname 483**] had another cerbral angiogram on [**11-21**] which again revealed no evidence of an aneurysm.
Mr. [**Known lastname 483**] also had some episodes of intermittent hyponatremia which were treated with salt tablets.
His only complaints were headache and nausea with intermittent episodes of vomiting.
However, due to his low serum dilantin levels and the appearance of a rash on [**11-22**] that may have been related to the dilantin, he was switched to Keppra on HD 10.
His nausea and vomiting subsided with the first 2-3 days in the hospital.

He did have a left cephalic vein thrombosis, but had no evidence of a DVT elsewhere.
