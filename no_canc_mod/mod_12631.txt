Admission Date:  [**2184-12-31**]     Discharge Date:  [**2185-1-10**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history type 2 diabetes and hypertension who was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit on [**12-31**] as a transfer from [**Hospital3 17310**] for bradycardia with an idioventricular rhythm.
intake, increased dyspnea, and assessment mental status changes.
On [**12-31**], Emergency Medical Service was called, and the patient was found bradycardic at home with a heart rate in the 20s with an idioventricular rhythm and associated hypotension.
A chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure.
There were no ketones in the urine.
AST and ALT were elevated, consistent with shock liver.
She was subsequently wrapped in warm blankets for hypothermia and intubated for comfort.
On arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 346**], electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus bradycardia at 40 beats to 50 beats per minute with a left bundle-branch block.
The patient received 10 mg of subcutaneous vitamin K.  The patient was given aggressive intravenous fluids for acute renal failure thought secondary to prerenal azotemia.
Given question of sepsis and active sputum, the patient was started on Levaquin for a question of pneumonia.
Neck revealed no jugular venous distention, though difficult to assess.
Lungs had crackles halfway up bilaterally.
Extremities revealed trace pedal edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray on the day of transfer revealed congestive heart failure with underlying chronic interstitial disease with evidence of increased cephalization compared to the prior study with the question of a left lower lobe process.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient presented with bradycardia thought secondary to prerenal state, perhaps brought about by hyperglycemia and/or infection.
Prerenal state may have resulted in acidosis hyperkalemia with possible poor clearance of her atrioventricular nodal blockers which included verapamil and atenolol at the time of presentation.
The patient had no known cardiac history; although, her son later admitted that she had a heart attack years earlier.
She was noted to have  a troponin leak in the setting of congestive heart failure and poor perfusion.
Otherwise, she ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
The patient was placed on telemetry with no acute arrhythmias; however, she was noted to be in sinus tachycardia consistently status post transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient underwent an echocardiogram which revealed evidence of global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of approximately 35% and a partially reversible inferolateral defect.
PULMONARY:  The patient was maintained on Levaquin for presumed pneumonia and completed a 10-day course with a normalization of her white blood cell count and no fevers.
She initially underwent some gentle diuresis for congestive heart failure but did not require further diuresis for the duration of her hospital stay.
However, she was maintained on aggressive ACE inhibitor for afterload and preload reduction.
RENAL:  The patient with a history of acute renal failure on presentation, consistent with generalized hypoperfusion in the setting of her bradycardia.
She experienced no recurrent hyperkalemia.
She should likely be evaluated for an outpatient colonoscopy given her iron deficiency anemia.
She was found to be iron deficient and was repleted during this hospitalization.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient with a history of type 2 diabetes.
Acute renal failure.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Recommend outpatient colonoscopy to evaluate for iron deficiency anemia.
