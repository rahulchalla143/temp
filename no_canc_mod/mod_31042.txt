Plan: # Melena/Coffee ground emesis Pt with melena and 14 point drop in hct in the context of an INR of 10.

HCT remained stable and she had no episodes of melena or hemetemesis while inpatient.
# Coagulopathy Pt with a reported INR of 10 at OSH, unclear etiology, but likely due to decreased PO intake over the past 2 weeks with poor follow up of INR levels.

EKG only showed <1mm of ST depressions laterally; 2 sets of CE's were negative.
