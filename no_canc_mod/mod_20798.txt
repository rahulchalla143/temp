The right sacral ala fracture demonstrated by CT scan is not distinctly visible on the current examination due to technical factors.
In particular, the inlet and outlet views are quite limited due to technique.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of an acute fracture or dislocation spanning from the occipital condyles down to the superior endplate of C4.
There is a Schmorl's node in the posterior aspect of the superior endplate of C4.
IMPRESSION: 1) Large hematoma in the preperitonel space from pelvic fractures as described below.
No evidence of active contrast extravasation.
2) Comminuted fracture through the superior and inferior pubic rami.
Accompanying fracture through the right sacroiliac joint.
3) Fractures of transverse processes of L1 and L2.
Pelvis XR [**9-22**]: There are minimally displaced fractures of the left superior and inferior pubic ramus.
The inferior pubic ramus fracture is segmental, with two separate fracture sites in an intervening segment.
No obvious sacral fracture is identified, though sacral fractures are commonly associated with this kind of pubic ramus fracture.
No diastasis of the SI joints or pubic symphysis is identified.
No other fractures are detected.
No gross callus formation is detected.
Her CT scan here showed a pelvic hematoma but no signs of continued bleeding or extravasation of contrast.
She was seen by the orthopedics service for her pelvic fractures & the spine service for her Lumbar transverse process fractures.
No surgical intervertion or angio was needed.
Repeat Xrays of her pelvis showed stable appearance of her pelvic fractures On HD 6, she was cleared by PT/OT and had much improved pain control.
She was ambulating with her brace without difficulty.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pelvic fracture (superior & inferior rami, sacral fracture) L1-L2 Transverse process fracture   Discharge Condition: good  Discharge Instructions: Activity as tolerated.
For any other questions or if you have pain or any other difficulties, you can be seen in the trauma clinic.
