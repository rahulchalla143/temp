History of Present Illness: This patient is a 74 year old male with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, previous coronary stenting, and angina who complains of chest pain.
At 10pm, while eating dinner pt felt sharp substernal chest pain ([**6-8**]) that lasted 1min before it resolved with nitro.
Pt reports pain radiated to back during this time also.
He denies any SOB w/ this episode.
No arm or back pain.
No diaphoresis.
Repeat EKG this AM, showed T waves flipped.

-Employment:retired security officer.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: 1+ edema in [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6816**] SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pertinent Results: IMAGING  Cardiac Cath ([**5-4**]):  1) Selective angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated significant two-vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had 99% in-stent restenosis at the recent angioplasty site, with high-grade stenosis of the ostium of the diagonal branch as well.
The dominant LCx had moderate disease.
The non-dominant RCA was known to have 100% proximal occlusion from the previous catheterization on [**2121-1-23**].
2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial normotension, with a central aortic pressure of 121/65 mmHg.
3) The right common femoral artery arteriotomy site was Angiosealed after the case.
Severe in-stent restenosis of the proximal LAD, involving the ostium of the diagonal branch.
EKG [**5-3**]: II, III, aVF, V3-6 shows new inverted T waves EKG ([**5-4**]): showed ST elevation in lead V2 w/ ST depression in leads V5/V6 and I .
[**2121-5-6**] Intra-op TEE Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque .
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Transiently severely depressed LV and RV systolci function.
There is mild TR now and mild MR.  3.
No other change .

Chest pain responded rapidly to nitro making MI less likely especially given negative troponins x2 upon presentation.
Initial EKG showed no changes, but EKG in ED the morning after showed inverted T waves in several leads.
On [**5-4**], the pt experienced multiple episodes of CP in the morning.
Trops cont be neg, but ST elevation seen on EKG in lead V2 w/ ST depression in V5/6.
trop neg x6, but concern for ischemia given changes in EKG.
pt taken to cath which showed restenosis of prox LAD.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Foley was re-inserted for urinary retention.
By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
