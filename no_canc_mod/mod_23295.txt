Dynamic blood pool images show no abnormal tracer signal in the region of the right abdominal/pelvic retroperitoneal bleed.
IMPRESSION: No findings to suggest an active retroperitoneal bleeding during the period of study.
Right retroperitoneal hematoma, similar in size to the prior study, without evidence for active extravasation.
Small hypodensities in the liver, too small to characterize.
Diverticulosis of the colon, without evidence of diverticulitis.
Calcified right pleural plaques.
Increased extent of right retroperitoneal hematoma now with some associated left-sided extension.
Evidence of active extravasation is not able to be evaluated on this noncontrast examination.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Retained nephrograms seen on this noncontrast study indicative of renal failure.
Calcified right-sided pleural plaques, compatible with prior asbestos exposure.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 86824**] was evaluated in the Emergency Room, CT scans were reviewed which demonstrated a right retroperitoneal bleed and his hematocrit was 38 down from 45 at [**Hospital3 3583**].
He was transfused with 3 units of blood and 3 units of FFP and admitted to the ICU for serial hematocrits and abdominal exams.
He continued to have aggressive volume resuscitation and his urine output was greater than 80 ml/hr.
A repeat Abdominal CT on [**2123-1-26**] showed no active bleeding and his hematocrit remained stable in the 28-30 range.
