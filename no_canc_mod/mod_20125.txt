Work-up at the outside hospital revealed cholestasis of unknown etiology.
She was found to be bacteremic with persistent fevers and enterococcus in the urine.
At presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], history was limited by confabulation and tangential answers.
She reports increased abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting in the days preceding admission on [**10-10**].
She stated pain preceded nausea and vomiting, and then jaundice followed.
She denies dietary changes, mushroom intake, medication changes, history of IVDU or intranasal cocaine.
She believes she has experienced 10 pound weight loss over weeks preceding [**10-10**].

LFT's were consistent with a cholestatic picture, but U/S, MRCP, and CT of abdomen were unrevealing with possible gallstone ileus.
She was rapidly tapered off steroid on presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**], where the patient continued to have persistent fevers with maximum temperatures of 104 farenheit.
CT abdomen/pelvis  revealed a low density fatty liver with ascites.
There was a hypoattenuating area within segment 4 of the liver which may represent an area of focal fat, edema or hemangioma, but tumor could not be excluded.
There was no intrahepatic biliary dilatation and the gallbladder was unremarkable (probable tiny gallstones but no evidence of biliary obstruction).
There was a left adrenal lesion consistent with a likely left adrenal adenoma.
There were mildly dilated loops of small bowel without evidence of obstruction consistent with an ileus.
MR abdomen revealed an abnormal heterogeneous enhancement pattern of the liver, which was interpreted as a nonspecific finding which can be seen in cases of acute viral and toxic hepatitis.
There were tiny enhancing lesions in the left lobe of the liver as above.
There were larger nonenhancing lesions in segment 4 of the liver without imaging characteristics typical of hemangioma or cyst.
Ultrasound guided paracentesis was performed as well which revealed a gradient of 1.1 consistent with cirrhosis and borderline transudative process.
A difficult ultrasound guided liver biopsy was performed which revealed marked steatosis with abundant intracellular hyalin and neutrophilic reaction.
Trichrome stain showed prominent sinusoidal fibrosis, without cirrhosis.
Iron stain showed no definite stainable iron.
There was evidence of tumor seen.
Ciprofloxacin was added and later discontinued for SBP prophylaxis.
Despite these studies, the patient continued to spike fevers accompanied by mental status changes, but blood cultures continued to be negative.
CT abdomen was repeated which again revealed no evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.
Caspofungin was started for possible fungal coverage.
Unfortunately, the patient continued to spike and the patient developed a pruritic back/truncal/lower extremity rash.
TEE was performed which was negative for endocarditis.
Repeat CT was performed on [**11-15**] which showed no abscess.
Liver lesions were unchanged from prior study.
There was some cecal and splenic flexure colonic thickening.
Ultracound was repeated which showed diffuse fatty infiltrate of the liver, without significant ascites.
There were small lesions in segment 2 of the liver.
By discharge from the unit, the patient remained afebrile while only on vancomycin, flagyl, meropenem.
Flagyl was discontinued with the thought of possible relation to mental status changes.
The patient returned to the floor on [**2108-11-19**] with persistent low grade fevers, but mental status improved to where she was alert and oriented times three.
4)FULL CODE  5)Dispo: pending resolution of fevers/etiology of cholestasis  ***Needs follow-up in [**3-17**] months with CT or MRI for ?adrenal mass.
