She has also had orthopnea requiring her to sleep on two pillows last night and reports increased PND.
She reports chest pain (pleuritic vs. MSK) with deep inspiration that she feels is connected to her recent complaint of left shoulder, neck, and chest wall pain; this was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Ortho as an outpatient and ascribed to glenohumeral arthritis and outlet impingement syndrome.
In the past two days, she states her cough has become productive.
She thinks this is at times related to difficulty swallowing or choking on food although she denies any globus sensation; she is also unsure if the coughing sometimes causes difficulty swallowing.
Today, she developed a low grade fever and notes that she actually has been experiencing night sweats for "months."
She was given ASA 81mg x 3 due to initial concern for cardiac etiology.
PA/lateral CXR showed a markedly increased cardiac sillouette with bilateral L>R pleural effusions and left atelectasis.
Cardiology was called for a bedside ultrasound to evaluate for pericardial effusion; there was no evidence of tamponade.
Pt was given levofloxain 750mg IV and later tylenol 1000mg for fever to 100.3.
She is being admitted for further workup of the cardiac and pleural effusions.
On the floor, pt complains mostly of pain involving her left shoulder, neck, chest wall, and back.
She has taken tylenol without much efficacy and states a lidoderm patch is helpful.
Review of sytems: No recent weight loss or gain.
Orthostatic lightheadedness on Sunday which improved by the next day without intervention - none currently.
Occasional headache and recent left ear pain with hearing changes.
No rhinorrhea or congestion.
Periodic nausea which led to finding of cystic neoplasm in the uncinate process of the pancreas with negative (limited) cytology but elevated CEA concerning for mucinous neoplasm (IPMN vs. CMN); undergoing active surveillance as outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**].
She also has noted a possible left neck cyst and is to follow up with ENT.
No constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain; no recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Diffuse arthralgias or myalgias chronically.
Longstanding pruritis of extremities which has increased recently.

General: Alert, oriented, uncomfortable due to shoulder pain but in no acute distress, speaking in full sentences.
Chest: Exam limited as pt refused to sit up due to shoulder pain but decreased breath sounds at bases L>R with mild rales, no wheezes or rhonchi.
TTP over left chest wall.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.

The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
-Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**1-26**]/201, sustained right atrial collapse is now seen, consistent with possible early tamponade physiology.
Small left pleural effusion has simple fluid characteristics and does not demonstrate CT findings associated with empyema.
Pericardial fluid and pneumopericardium, the latter reportedly related to recent drainage procedure.
Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, right greater than left, with near complete collapse of right lower lobe.
Subsequent removal of 640cc of pericardial fluid (all sent for studies) and confirmation by bedside echocardiogram of sucessful removal of fluid with appropriate catheter position.
Pericardial tamponade with improvement of pericardial pressure after removeal of 640 cc fluid.
# Pericardial effusion: Etiology remains unclear but malignancy on the differential.
Pt is undergoing work-up of mucinous pancreatic neoplasm with elevated CEA (likely IPMN or MCN) as well as presumed recurrent thyroglossal cyst (with ENT).
She additionally has a h/o breast cancer although most recent mammogram from [**6-/2144**] was birads-2; nl colonoscopy in 5/[**2142**].
Echo showed possible early tamponade with moderate to large pericardial effusion.
A repeat echo was performed on [**2145-1-28**] and showed no effusion.
She was started on ibuprofen and morphine prn for pleuritic chest pain.
Pericardial fluid cytology was negative for malginancy.
C3/C4 and TSH were WNL and notably Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Chest CT showed small left pleural effusion has simple fluid characteristics not consistent with empyema.
Also with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, right greater than left, with near complete collapse of right lower lobe.
She was treated with levofloxacin for 7 days for a possible pneumonia and her home dose of Lasix.
She will follow up with her PCP for further evaluation of her respiratory status.
# Anaphylaxis: Chest CT with contrast was obtained and while patient received IV dye, she became acutely short of breath and hypotensive to the 70s.
She was given an epi pen along with steroids and anti-histamines and her symptoms resolved.
She was monitored for nearly 72 hours post event and had no further reactions.
# Left shoulder/chest pain: Most likely MSK due to outlet impingement syndrome & glenohumeral arthritis per Ortho eval.
[**Month (only) 116**] have had some component of referred pain.
# Lightheadedness: Intermittent, and the patient had negative orthostasis.
Patient denied any change in fluid intake or fluid loss and was never anemic.
# HL: Dr/ [**Last Name (STitle) **]' note suggests Lipitor was discontinued .
# Chronic dCHF: Was compensated.
# Gout: Never flared and was treated with home allopurinol.
# Depression/anxiety: Treated with home citalopram .
