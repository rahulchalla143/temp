[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] after a positive exercise stress test.
She had undergone a cardiac catheterization which demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease and, more specifically, a high grade stenosis of the mid LAD, high grade stenosis of the left circumflex, and complete occlusion of the RCA.
When she presented to the office, she did have some dyspnea on exertion, but no worsening chest pain, and review of systems was negative.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, history of a breast mass.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She had a breast biopsy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother had coronary artery disease history.
No acute distress.
She had a chest x-ray preoperatively which showed no acute infiltrate or congestive heart failure.
The cardiac catheterization which was done at [**Hospital3 1280**] on [**2133-1-6**] demonstrates three vessel coronary artery disease with a right dominant circulation, high grade stenosis of the mid-LAD, proximal segment of the larger left circumflex, and 100 percent occlusion of the proximal RCA.
Her early postoperative course was significant for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with normal blood pressure.
At this point, on the floor she remained hemodynamically stable, and telemetry demonstrated that she would have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with no effect on hemodynamic status.
She was maintained on beta blockade, and the decision was made to anticoagulate her, due to her frequent episodes of atrial fibrillation followed by sinus rhythm.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG x 3.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
Gastroesophageal reflux disorder.
