The patient's chest x-ray on admission was negative, and a magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography done showed no acute infarction and no flow changes in the arteries.
On [**1-31**], the patient had a temperature spike to 101.8 degrees, and then in the early evening complained of chest pain.
Approximately one to two hours later, the patient had respiratory failure with an arterial blood gas of 7.04/112/84, with a blood pressure of 220/100, and a pulse of 110.
Then, secondary to hypotension (with a systolic blood pressure drop to 70) was transiently placed on dopamine and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on home oxygen).
Peripheral vascular disease.
Bilateral aortoiliac occlusion.
Cerebrovascular accident in occipital area after a right internal carotid artery stent.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's family history included coronary artery disease.
No history of intravenous drug use.
In general,  the patient appeared to be in no apparent distress and was intubated.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination showed anicteric sclerae.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Pulmonary examination showed diffuse wheezes with some rhonchi.
The patient's extremities showed no edema and no calf tenderness.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  The patient's electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 132 beats per minute with no acute changes compared to prior electrocardiograms.
The patient's echocardiogram done on [**1-31**] showed an ejection fraction of 40 percent with severe pulmonary hypertension and severe mitral regurgitation.
There was no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale noted on the Doppler.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient had been intubated secondary to respiratory failure, and after eight days of intubation had repeated unsuccessful attempts at extubated and a failure to wean.
After repeated attempts to maximize the patient's extubated conditions, the patient was still unable to be weaned or extubated.
