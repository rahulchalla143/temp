She stated that she had several episodes of bright red blood per rectum in the past, yet all previous occurrences had resolved spontaneously.
She also complained of abdominal pain and increasing fatigue in recent weeks.
She denies having any nausea or vomiting.
She also denies having any lightheadedness or syncope.
Steroid dependent myopathy resulting in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 2.
Atrial fibrillation; 3.
Sleep apnea with BiPAP at night; 9.
Degenerative joint disease and chronic back pain, status post laminectomy; 11.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease; 12.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No significant history of cardiac, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hepatic or lung disease.
No history of cancer.
The patient was restless and anxious and in moderate distress.
Neck supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac examination showed an irregularly irregular rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen, normoactive bowel sounds, soft diffusely tender, moderately distended with no hepatosplenomegaly, guaiac positive stool.
Extremities, 2+ distal pulses, no edema, cyanosis, jaundice or clubbing.
Shortly after arrival to the floor the patient had two episodes of dark, grossly melanotic stool, approximately 150 cc in volume.
The patient subsequently decompensated after her second bowel movement with a blood pressure drop down to 86/46, became tachycardiac to 110, respiratory rate increased to 24 and her oxygen saturation decreased to 80%.
The patient also complained of chest pain and diaphoresis.
Repeat hematocrit in the MICU showed a drop to 10.5.
Urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which found prepyloric ulcers but no source of active bleeding.
Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy found a bleeding ulcer in the fundus of the stomach.
Well ventilated, the patient had increased dark-colored respiratory secretions and spiked a fever to 102.8.
Chest x-ray showed increased right lobe opacity.
She was started on Vancomycin following gram positive cocci on sputum gram stain and blood cultures.
Sputum cultures subsequently grew out Pseudomonas and Ceftazidime was added.
Gastrointestinal - Upon admission to the floor she was stable with no further evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeds.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed erosions, erythema and ulcerations on the epiglottis and vocal folds.
There was an ulcer in the stomach body which was biopsied and two ulcers in the antrum of the stomach.
No stigmata of recent bleeding were found.
She has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and alternated between normal sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation throughout her stay in the MICU.
She continued to have about five episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation while on the Medical Floor.
She was not a candidate for anticoagulation given her recent gastrointestinal bleeds.
Her atrial fibrillation was managed with rate control agents while in the MICU.
On the Medical Floor she was restarted on Atenolol and did not demonstrate any episodes of rapid ventricular rate.
Electrophysiology Service had seen the patient and determined that she was not a good candidate for cardioversion given that it was unknown how long the patient had been in and out of sinus rhythm as well as the inability to anticoagulate her.
The patient is also not a candidate for Amiodarone, given her pulmonary disease.
Pulmonary - The patient has a history of inclusion body myositis requiring intubation in the past and also has a history of baseline carbon dioxide retention.
She was continued on BiPAP at night given her history of sleep apnea and was also continued on p.o.
Infectious disease - The patient's fever curve and white blood cell count gradually decreased while she was on the floor.
Ceftazidime was continued for Pseudomonas pneumonia for a planned 10 day course.
No further issues.
She was monitored for any mental status changes and remained at this level of cognition throughout her hospital course.
Atrial fibrillation.
Inclusion body myositis and restrictive lung disease.
