At the outside hospital he ruled in for a non Q wave myocardial infarction, which was associated with one episode of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, which was easily reversed to normal sinus rhythm with direct shock cardioversion followed by lidocaine bolus and drip after which the patient was transferred to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year-old man with known oligo symptomatic three vessel disease developed his first episode of chest pain the day prior to admission while working on building a garage.
The chest pain was accompanied by shortness of breath, which is his usual anginal equivalent and was unrelieved by sublingual nitroglycerin, so he went to a local hospital in [**State 1727**] where his symptoms were improved with treatment of oxygen and nitroglycerin.
The pain had peaked at an 8 over 10 level and improved to a 4 over 10 by arrival to the Emergency Room.
He was also diuresed and reportedly was fine until about 5:00 in the morning when his monitor alarmed for a ventricular tachycardia.
He was thumped without response and then cardioverted with 200 jewels to normal sinus rhythm.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes mellitus, status post laser eye surgery, probable neuropathy, hypercholesterolemia on a lipid lower placebo controlled study currently.
He had a stress test in [**2149-1-20**] during which he became hypotensive.
There were 3 mm horizontal down sloping ST depressions.
His EF at that time was 40% and he was found to have moderate reversible perfusion defects in the inferior wall extending to the apex.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No signs of consolidation.
Chronic stasis changes.
Electrocardiogram, normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 100 with a normal axis, normal R wave progression, normal intervals, scooped ST depressions in 1L and 1 to [**Street Address(2) 30305**] depressions in V3 through 5.
In summary, the catheterization showed an ejection fraction of 55% with trivial mitral regurgitation, left main 50%, left anterior descending coronary artery 90%, left circumflex diffusely diseased and right coronary artery diffusely diseased.
At the time of transfer the patient had an arterial line, a Swans-Ganz catheter, two ventricular and two apical pacing wires, two mediastinal chest tubes and one left pleural chest tube.
The patient's postoperative course was initially complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate into the 150s for which he was cardioverted into a normal sinus rhythm and an Amiodarone drip was begun.
He also had depressed cardiac index for which Dopamine was started at 3 micrograms per kilogram per minute.
The patient remained on postoperative cardiac surgery floor for the next four days where he was monitored for his hemodynamic and his renal status.
S1 and S2 with no murmur.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
No pulses appreciated.
Right lower extremity incision with Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting times five.
Diabetes mellitus.
Renal insufficiency.
Peripheral vascular disease.
