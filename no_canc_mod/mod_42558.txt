MMS ReconstructionATTN: Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **] Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 77 year old man with chest pain radiating to back REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Evaluation of thoracic aorta.
INDICATION: 77-year-old man with chest pain radiating to the back.
CTA CHEST: Again seen is intramural hematoma involving the descending aorta and focal penetrating ulcer not significantly changed in appearance compared to the prior study.
Mild aneurysmal dilatation of the descending aorta is unchanged, measuring 4.7 x 4.0 cm (series 3, image 20).
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
There are no enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
Lung windows reveal no pulmonary nodules or focal consolidations.
There is a filling defect in a subsegmental right lower lobe pulmonary artery not confirmed on multiplanar reformatted images possibly representing mixing artifact.
Kidneys are atrophic with small hypodensities likely representing cysts but not fully characterized.
Scattered retroperitoneal nodes do not meet CT criteria for enlargement.
There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen.
No enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
There are degenerative changes of the shoulder joint and a right humeral prosthesis.
There are moderate degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.
Stable appearance of intramural hematoma and focal penetrating ulcer involving the proximal descending thoracic aorta with mild aneurysmal dilatation.
Small pleural effusions.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name **]  RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CTU (ABD/PEL) W/CONTRAST  [**2107-8-1**] 7:35 PM  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CTU (ABD/PEL) W/CONTRAST  Reason: eval dissection Field of view: 40 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 77 year old man with chest pain radiating to back REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval dissection CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
HISTORY: 73-year-old man with chest pain radiating to the back.
CT OF THE CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS  TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images were obtained through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous contrast only.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is no evidence of acute aortic dissection.
There has been interval progression of ulcerating plaque within the descending aorta and amount of mural thrombus.
Additionally, there is mild aneurysmal dilatation measuring approximately 4.1 x 4.5 cm (3:22).
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified.
Artifact from left-sided central venous catheter and pacemaker leads is noted along with mild coronary artery calcification.
There is bilateral dependent atelectasis and a minimal left-sided pleural effusion, new since prior examination.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, intra-abdominal bowel, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
Both kidneys appear slightly atrophic with bilateral hypoattenuating lesions, too small to definitively characterize but likely representing simple cyst.
No free air or free fluid is noted within the abdominal cavity.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are present.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is hypertrophy of the median lobe of the prostate with intrapelvic bowel and urinary bladder appearing unremarkable.
No free fluid is noted within the pelvic cavity.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified.
BONE WINDOWS: No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are identified.
There are severe multilevel degenerative changes involving the thoracic and lumbar spine.
Marked progression to mural thrombus and a focal aortic ulceration involving the proximal descending thoracic aorta with mild aneurysmal dilatation as noted above.
No focal dissection identified.
New minimal left-sided left pleural effusion.
Bilateral renal hypoattenuating lesions.
He had CTA torso w/reconstruction and it was decided he would benefit from endovascular stenting.
