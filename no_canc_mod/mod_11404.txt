HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure of restrictive type and aortic stenosis who was initially admitted to [**Hospital 487**] Hospital on [**2111-2-4**] with complaints of worsening lower extremity edema and dyspnea on exertion.
She denied any chest pain, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
An echocardiogram at that time indicated an EF of 40 to 45% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, severe apical hypokinesis, moderate septal and distal hypokinesis and severe atrial fibrillation.
Chest CT at the outside hospital showed an incidental finding of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary artery prominence.
She was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further management and possible cardiac catheterization.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2105**] with left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to the ramus, obtuse marginal and posterior descending coronary artery.
History of congestive heart failure restrictive type.
Aortic stenosis.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
She was an elderly appearing woman in no acute distress.
Sclera anicteric.
No palpable thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.
She had bilateral crackles two thirds of the way up.
Her heart was regular rate and rhythm occasionally bradycardic with 3 out of 6 systolic murmur from the right upper sternal border radiating to the neck.
Her lower extremities had 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Her right groin had no bruit.
Electrocardiogram from the outside hospital showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 49, normal axis, mild PR prolongation consistent with first degree block and T wave flattening in the lateral leads.
Cardiac catheterization showed a proximal 100% left anterior descending coronary artery lesion, left circumflex was 70% proximal 100% mid occlusions, right coronary artery with 100% proximal and patent saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal grafts, 70% left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to ramus and posterior descending coronary artery totally occluded.
Her right sided filling pressures were markedly elevated with a right atrial pressure of 97/20, right ventricular 98/10, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 32 and 45 mm peak to peak pressure.
It was believed that her acute renal failure was secondary to contrast nephropathy on top of a chronic renal insufficiency caused by her diabetes and hypertension.
This biopsy did not reveal any malignant cells and instead showed a hypocellular specimen with a few group of bronchial cells, pulmonary macrophages, lymphocytes, red blood cells and neutrophils.
The patient also has a known anemia, which may be secondary to her chronic renal insufficiency and required transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells during this hospitalization.
Given the problems listed above full surgical evaluation was deferred until her renal function returns to baseline and her pulmonary process is completely worked up as described.
At that time it is expected that after checking a repeat chem 7 and her renal function that a number of her medications that were held secondary to her renal failure will be able to be reinstituted.
After her repeat CT scan she will again be evaluated at her cardiologist's discretion for possible AVR and coronary artery bypass graft.
Congestive heart failure.
Aortic stenosis valve area of 0.55.
Acute on chronic renal failure secondary to contrast induced nephropathy, hypertension and diabetes.
