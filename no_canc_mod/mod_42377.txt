Admission Date:  [**2111-11-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-11-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2033-7-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Pleuritic chest pain: Admission Notable for new Pulmonary Embolism and DVT  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ICU Level of Care   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 78 year-old female w/ HTN, hypercalcemia (presumptive primary hyperparathyroidism), former smoker, and 2 previous post-surgical DVTs who presented from her [**Hospital 4382**] facility with sudden onset of right-sided chest and back pain at 11:45 am while she was lying in bed.
Patient described the pain as quite pleuritic, "not really dull or not really sharp".
She denied any palpitations, SOB, or LH, or loss of consciousness.
Has never had this type of chest pain before.
Has chronic pain in her L knee since her replacement in [**3-10**], but no tenderness or pain above baseline over past 24 hrs.
Denies any recent travel history on planes or cars, any abnormal bleeding or clotting abnormalities, or use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy.
Pain was unrelenting, so patient told the resident physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] her symptoms, which resulted in the EMS call and her ED admission.
EKG showed old RBBB and LAFB.
CXR showed left-sided atelectasis, no focal consolidation.
While in the ED, she complained of severe mid-back pain and CTA chest was performed, which showed "Wet Read: Saddle PE with emboli extending into most lobes, with large thrombi within the RUL, RLL and lingular arteries."
In the ICU, EKG was performed which showed old RBBB, no acute ischemic changes.
She had no tachycardia and her SBPs were stable in the 100-150.
Heparin gtt was continued and her home anti-hypertensives were held overnight for fear of hemodynamic instability.
Her fever and WBC resolved while in the ICU and she was called out to the floor this AM.
Past Medical History: - Hypertension - Hypercalcemia - question primary hyperparathyroidism - History of deep venous thrombosis in [**2101**] - On keppra for unclear reasons (antiepileptic versus mood stabilizer) - Peripheral neuropathy - Gout - Status post left total knee replacement - Status post total abdominal hysterectomy for fibroids - Breast biopsy with benign pathology - Status post two closed reductions post total hip replacement - Status post tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy   Social History: [**Hospital 8735**] medical records administrator, divorced.
Family History: No family history of clotting disorders.
Pulm: CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: soft, obese, NT, +BS.
Extremities: wwp, skin taut BL with no pitting edema.
Extensive pulmonary embolism including a saddle embolus and extensive thrombus within the right upper, right lower lobes as well as the lingula.
Peripheral wedge-shaped opacities within the right upper lobe and lingula which may represent pulmonary infarcts.
8-mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule.
Arterially enhancing right hepatic lesion likely represents a hemangioma.
[**2111-11-23**] Vasc Studies Extensive left lower extremity DVT as described above.
[**2111-11-24**] Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is a moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
[**2111-11-25**] CXR  In comparison with study of [**11-24**], the opacification at the left base has substantially cleared with some residual atelectatic change.
[**2111-11-25**] Head CT FINDINGS: There is moderate prominence of sulci and ventricles indicating brain atrophy.
There is also minimal dilatation of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] seen.
There is no acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage identified or midline shift seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan: 78 yo F with previous hx of DVT, hypercalcemia (presumptively 1' hyperparathyroidism), and recent immobilization s/p fall who presents with chest pain, found to have saddle PE on CTA.
# Pulmonary embolism: Patient has saddle embolus on CTA.
No indication for thrombolysis, as patient has been hemodynamically stable since admission without evidence of right heart strain (EKG with old RBBB, cardiac enzymes negative, and no significant changes on echocardiography).
Patient has acquired risk factors predisposing to DVT formation (former smoker, has had two post-surgical DVTs in the past, current PE associated with recent immobilization.)
Given her recurrent thromboses, she was referred to a hematologist for consultation as an outpatient, and discharged on anticoagulation as described below for an anticipated lengthy if not permanent duration.
The day following admission, the patient had recurrent fever to 102 and chest discomfort; ecg and biomarkers did not suggest myocardial injury, and blood/urine cx were unrevealing.
It was felt this could be progression of pulmonary infarction from PE, as seen on CTA.
She had no recurrent episodes.
# Deep Venous Thromobsis: Found on lower extremity noninvasive ultrasound.
Pt reports w/u at [**Hospital1 2025**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 103717**], endocrinology showing mild 1' hyperparathyrodism not warranting surgical treatment.
Her SPEP and UPEP were without abnormalities.
Echo did not show decreased ejection fraction and was not suggestive of hemodynamic effects of PE.
# Psychiatric: Known to have Alzheimer's Type Dementia and bipolar disorder, both stable.
Given anticoagulation, a head CT was checked before history was confirmed that patient had dementia, and was negative for territorial infarction or hemorrhage.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH level slightly elevated at 5.8; given that this is being checked at time of PE with infarction, recommend re-checking in the outpatient setting.
# Gout:  No acute issues.
# Incidentally noted pulmonary nodule, liver lesion: Should repeat CT as an outpatient was recommended assess for stability.
