no acute process.
Final Report INDICATION: Vertigo and bilateral subdural hematomas.
The aorta is slightly tortuous.
Linear opacity within the left lung base is compatible with subsegmental atelectasis.
Within the left upper lung field, there is a 4-mm nodule identified.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
Degenerative changes are noted within the thoracic spine.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
4-mm left upper lung nodule, for which no prior examinations are present for comparison.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    79 year old woman with SDH s/p crani for evacuation REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    post op head CT eval for bleeding.
FINDINGS: Again seen is a left parietal vertex craniotomy where there has been evacuation of a left subdural hematoma.
There is a small caliber subdural drain in situ.
Post-surgical changes are again seen within the left subdural space including decreased pneumocephalus and persistent blood but overall decreased material.
There is mild rightward subfalcine herniation of 3 mm, similar to prior.
An extra-axial subdural collection overlying the right cerebral convexity is unchanged, measuring 1 cm in maximal dimension.
The ventricular system appears similar to prior with no hydrocephalus.
Again seen is periventricular white matter low attention and focal low attention in the posterior right temporal lobe most compatible with chronic small vessel infarction.
Mastoid air cells and visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
Slightly decreased size of extra-axial collection of left parietal vertex extra-axial collection measuring to 1.4 cm with mild rightward herniation.
Stable small right subdural hematoma.

No other change.
Final Report CHEST PORTABLE  REASON FOR EXAM: 79-year-old woman with new fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
Since [**2118-5-30**], bibasilar opacities are new, could be atelectasis or aspiration.
Heart size slightly increased with increase in volume overload.
Left upper lung calcified opacity could be calcified granuloma or a rib bone island.
Right paratracheal opacity is likely due to tortuous vessels.
