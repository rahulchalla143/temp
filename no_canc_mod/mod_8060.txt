Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old female with multiple medical problems and a complicated medical history who presented to an outside hospital status post myocardial infarction for cardiac catheterization.
While in the Emergency Department, the patient developed chest pain associated with electrocardiogram changes.
She was admitted and continued to have electrocardiogram changes on the morning of admission; although, she was chest pain free at that time.
Coronary artery disease.
(a)  Status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2139**] with a left internal mammary artery to first diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending artery and obtuse marginal.
(c)  Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2144**].
(d)  non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2146**].
Chronic renal insufficiency with bilateral renal artery peripheral vascular disease.
No carotid disease.
The patient has undergone a left femoral-popliteal bypass in [**2144**] with a left iliac angioplasty in [**2133**].
The patient is status post left anterior cerebral infarction from left endarterectomy with minimal residual.
The patient has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Recurrent congestive heart failure.
History of pilonidal cysts.
History of left retinal hemorrhage.
She has an oxygen requirement of one liter per nasal cannula.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with severe pulmonary edema.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2148-9-7**] (at 1410), the patient developed flash pulmonary edema with hypertension and a blood gas of 7.2/40/63.
A chest x-ray at that time showed cardiomegaly with blunting of the right costophrenic angle with peripheral vascular redistribution and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which demonstrated severe 3-vessel disease.
The grafts were visualized with a patent left internal mammary artery to the first diagonal, the saphenous obtuse marginal was patent with a distal limb atretic with retrograde filling of the left circumflex.
The saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was patent with diffuse distal branch disease and 90% stenosis of the posterolateral branch.
The resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderately elevated left-sided and right-sided filling pressures with a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 15, a pulmonary wedge pressure of 15, and the right atrial mean pressure was 10, and the central aortic pressures were normal.
Ultimate recommendations were that she would require an angiography to determine the extent of her peripheral vascular disease.
Her post myocardial infarction course was complicated by recurrent pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure requiring afterload reduction and diuretics for improvement, diminished renal output secondary to hypoperfusion and microvascular disease, with a peak creatinine of 2.4, and difficulty with swallowing which was evaluated by a Speech and Swallow evaluation.
This showed mild pharyngeal dysphagia.
On [**9-24**], after Mucomyst and intravenous hydration protocol, an arteriogram which demonstrated abdominal aorta with moderate diffuse disease.
The right renal artery had a dual supply with a 90% stenosis at the osseus, and the left renal artery had an 80% stenosis with ulceration.
The left lower extremity showed the common femoral artery with mild disease.
The graft was patent, but the distal anastomosis showed 99% stenosis with reconstitution of the popliteal with distal occlusion at the AK.
Because of the patient's renal failure, she did require a hemodialysis catheter placement and dialysis was begun for volume control.
On postoperative day six, the patient had an episode of increased shortness of breath with a negative electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes.
A chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.
On [**10-8**], the patient underwent a transmetatarsal amputation without complications.
A right renal artery stenting bilaterally with both arteries of the superior and lower arteries and a left renal artery stenting was done without complications.
On [**10-14**], angiotensin receptor blocker and beta blockers were adjusted because of persistent systolic hypertension.
There was mild discoloration of the anterior and posterior skin flaps, but the foot was warm.
Peripheral vascular disease with left heel ulceration; status post left femoral AK popliteal to anterior tibial with reversed saphenous vein graft on [**10-1**].
Left transmetatarsal amputation secondary to toe necrosis on [**10-8**].
Coronary artery disease.
Systolic hypertension with medication adjustment; controlled.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency compounded with acute tubular necrosis secondary to hypoperfusion and microvascular disease; corrected.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; stable.
Recurrent congestive heart failure requiring afterload reduction and intubation, status post extubation; stable.
Bilateral renal artery stenosis, status post renal stents times three.
Diabetes mellitus; stable.
Hemodialysis to be done on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
