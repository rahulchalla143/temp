Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: OPERATION PERFORMED: Exploratory laparotomy with packing of liver and drainage of retroperitoneal injury  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gunshot wound to abdomen with hemoperitoneum, with left hepatic lobe laceration.
A chest x-ray furnished from the outside hospital showed the absence of a pneumothorax.
We made a midline laparotomy incision and opened the peritoneal cavity sharply.
We immediately noted a large stellate laceration of the left lobe of the liver, close to the inferior tip.
It was actively oozing although the amount of arterial bleeding was modest as opposed to the venous component.
We ran the entire small and large bowel and noted no injury.
The gunshot had gone directly in an anterior- posterior direction.
We noted the complete absence of any type of retroperitoneal hematoma.
There was no injury there.
I thought it was unlikely, therefore, that he would have a spinal cord injury.
When we ultimately removed our packs after completing our exploration, we found that it was no longer bleeding.
Accordingly, I placed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain through our gastro-hepatic ligament defect so that it lay at the depths of the bullet track, thus in a position to presumably drain any kind of pancreatic injury if it in fact existed.
