She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] from outside hospital status post fall and splenic laceration.
The patient was initially sent from her group home to an outside hospital because of uncontrolled sugars and in the outside hospital it was found that her LFTs were also elevated.
During her hospital course there, she had fallen off of her bed and there was a splenic laceration.
Diabetes mellitus.
Schizoaffective disorder with bipolar component.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
There is a positive family history of psychiatric illnesses.
States she has had an increase intake of junk food and has been somewhat depressed and worried since the death of her sister from complications of diabetes.
In general obese woman with ecchymosis around left eye intubated with neck collar in no acute distress.
Anicteric sclerae.
Jugular venous distention and lymphadenopathy could not be detected or examined.
Cardiovascular:  S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops heard.
Lungs:  Mild wheezes bilateral throughout.
Extremities:  2+ pitting edema upper and lower extremities bilateral (anasarca), 2+ distal pulses bilateral, warm extremities, right femoral line which is clear.
Pleural fluid with white blood cell 50, RBC 10,125, 1+ polys, no organisms grown, total protein 1.9, glucose 132, LDH 768.
Serum tox with no aspirin, no ethanol, no benzodiazepine, barbiturates with tricyclic detected.
CT Scan of torso with shallow splenic laceration with a small amount of free intraperitoneal fluid in the mesentery with greater attenuation closure to spleen.
No aortic injury or mediastinal hematoma.
No pneumothorax.
Partial collapse of right lung and right upper lobe with moderate effusion, left lower lobe consolidation.
CT Scan of head with no intracranial hemorrhage.
Chest x-ray with right sided chest tube, increased lung opacity in left retrocardial region, persistent left pleural effusion.
Trauma series with no wrist fractures, no pelvic fractures.
PULMONARY:  Patient had a chest tube that was placed to help with the drainage of the left pleural effusion / consolidation that was seen.
A repeat chest x-ray was obtained after that which showed no pneumothorax.
The pleural fluid was consistent with an exudative effusion which could be secondary to a parapneumonic effusion.
This is consistent with the fact that she may have a pneumonia since her sputum was also positive for gram negative rods.
GI:  Patient had a splenic laceration which was mild as per CT.
Surgery was following the patient who recommended that the best approach would be to treat her conservatively, hence no indication for surgery.
At that time, it was decided that we will hold off on the Glucophage and the Amantadine, both which are known to cause elevated LFTs.
for her pneumonia and also for her urinary tract infection as her urine was positive for six to 10 white blood cells.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Patient has moderate anasarca.
At that time, it was decided that an echo should be done which showed moderate pulmonary hypertension along with right atrial and right ventricular enlargement which are all consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
She is thought to have pulmonary hypertension secondary to her obstructive sleep apnea.
ENDOCRINOLOGY:  The patient was initially admitted to the outside hospital due to inability to control her sugars and it was mentioned that her sugars were always very elevated in the 200s to 300s.
A Josalin consult was obtained who agreed that we should hold off on the Glucophage, although it is very unlikely that Glucophage by itself would cause elevated LFTs.
PSYCH:  Patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is on medications consisting of Klonopin and Risperidone.
It was decided that there was no active psych issues to be involved.
DISPOSITION:  Initially the group home was unwilling to take her back as they felt it was unable for them to manage her [**Last Name **] problem and that she needed to be placed in a psych facility, however after extended discussion by the attending and with the group home, it was decided that she was to return back to the group home as she has no active psych issues involved.
