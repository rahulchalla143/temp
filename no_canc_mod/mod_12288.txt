Cardiomegaly, with mild volume overload.
It is unclear whether there is an underlying parenchymal consolidation.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Findings suggest extensive sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease; however, in this setting (and given the lack of prior studies available for comparison), a small acute infarct cannot be excluded and MRI, if feasible, is recommended for further evaluation if there is clinical concern.
Paranasal sinus chronic inflammatory disease, as above.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
with depressed free wall contractility.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.

BLOOD CX [**2110-3-1**]: PENDING BLOOD CX [**2110-3-2**]: PENDING BLOOD CX [**2110-3-3**]: PENDING   Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: 81 yo M with multiple medical problems including CAD s/p CABG, sCHF (EF 20-25%), Chronic AF on Coumadin, CHB s/p BiV ICD & PPM, Stage IV CKI, and anemia, presenting with lethargy and respiratory distress, intubated and on on pressors for hypotension.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hypoxic/Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: Most likely multifactorial including hypercapnea secondary to lethargy given elevated PCO2's on admission.
Pt also with volume overload and question of infilrate, resulting in hypoxia.
CVP's were elevated in 20's, suggesting volume overload.
Lasix gtt was started for pulmonary edema.
# Hypotension: Most likely [**2-26**] cardiogenic; differential included hypovolemia, distributive, or cardiogenic.
Pt appeared volume overloaded rather than hypovolemic, and had no signs of acute bleeding on admission.
A distributive picture was considered, though initially thought to be less likely given that he was afebrile and only mild leukocytosis.
Pt appeared volume overloaded, and had a known EF of 20-25% from [**2108**] at [**Location (un) 620**].
He had severely elevated BNP to 22,000 and CXR suggestive of volume overload.
He developed a temperature to 100.3 on evening of hospital day 2.
However, his fever curve downtrended.
Despite maximum doses of lasix, he failed to put out adequate urine output, and renal was consulted for dialysis.
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF: Hx of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
As above, presented with elevated BNP to 22,000 with clinical evidence of volume overload.
# Elevated cardiac enzymes: Pt presented with trops to 0.14, and MB flat.
Most likely [**2-26**] acute on chronic renal failure as below.
# RHYTHM: Hx of chronic A fib and complete heart block, now with BiVentricular ICD and PPM.
Patient [**Name (NI) **] paced so difficult to appreciate ST-T wave changes.
# Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease: Acute on chronic renal failure.
# Hyperkalemia: Likely [**2-26**] renal insufficiency  and acidosis.
No peaked T waves on EKG.
# Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic hyponatremia [**2-26**] heart failure and renal failure.
Urine lytes showed UNa of 33, demonstrating that pt had innappropriate loss of Na in urine given renal failure.
# Prolonged PT: [**2-26**] to likely nutritional deficiency prior to admission and decreased renal excretion.
# Metabolic encephalopathy: Multifactorial, including hypoxia, hypercapnea, possible infection, renal failure, and electrolyte disturbance.
CT head without showed chronic ischemic changes.
# Anemia: Chronic.
Of note, pt had recent admission for melena in [**Month (only) 1096**], received 2U PRBC with no further investigation by GI.
However, he developed hematuria likely [**2-26**] foley placement and supratherapeutic INR.
# Left submandibular neck mass: fleshy consistency, and without signs of infection.
