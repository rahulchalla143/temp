reports progresviely worsening DOE and weakness with exertion over the past six months.
She required rest with walking up one flight of staris or walking > [**Age over 90 **] yards.
No CP, no diaphoresis, no jaw or shoulder discomfort.
In [**Month (only) 404**] of [**2165**], she was easily fatigued and developed dyspnea with walking along the parking lot.
over the past 2 weeks, she noted dyspnea and weakness even with minimal activities like cooking and washing dishes.
She finally noted symptoms at rest (dyspnea and weakness) and would walk 20 feet at best before becoming exhausted.
Given this she underwent an TTE on [**2-10**] showing concentric LVH, nl cavity and size w/ septal hypokinesis and paradoxical septal motion (?
With persantine she noted DOE, CP and lightheadedness.
She had a high right femoral stcik.
No bleeding at groin site was noted post procedure, but she was transferred to CCU for observation and serial HCTs.
No CP or any kind of discomfort.
She does note an episode of flu like illness ~ 1mo ago and feels has since been fatigued more so than usual.
No presyncope or syncope.
No PND, orthopnea or leg swelling.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
No exertional buttock or calf pain.
At time of interview her major complaint was LBP and discomfort.
No abdominal pain.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: - Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.
-PACING/ICD:  SSS s/p PPM (AV paced) [**2162**] 3.
Osteoporosis LBP, chronic s/p surgery in [**2160**] Recurrent abdominal pain, now resolved.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities.
No HSM or tenderness.
No bruits at right groin, slightly TTP.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had stenosis in the mid-vessel up to 70%.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed [**Month/Day/Year 1192**] systemic arterial systolic hypertension 185/95 mmHg.
There was mild elevation of the left ventricular filling pressure with LVEDP 15 mmHg.
No true gradient across the aortic valve on careful pullback of the angled pigtail catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
Left ventriculography revealed mild anterior hypokinesis.
There was no mitral regurgitation.
Successful PTCA/Stenting of mid LAD stenosis with 2.75 X 23 mm PROMUS drug eluting stent to cover entire mid diseased segment.
Final angiogram showed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection and normal flow.
Mild left ventricular dysfunction.
Successful DES of mid LAD  Labs at discharge:  [**2166-3-8**] 04:02AM BLOOD WBC-6.9 RBC-4.02* Hgb-13.1 Hct-38.2 MCV-95 MCH-32.7* MCHC-34.4 RDW-13.8 Plt Ct-174 [**2166-3-8**] 04:02AM BLOOD Plt Ct-174 [**2166-3-8**] 04:02AM BLOOD Glucose-109* UreaN-19 Creat-0.7 Na-136 K-3.6 Cl-104 HCO3-23 AnGap-13 [**2166-3-8**] 04:02AM BLOOD Mg-1.8  Brief Hospital Course: 75-year-old woman with history of SSS s/p PPM (AV paced) in [**2162**], PAF, HTN, HL and LBP who presented for an elective cath after a positive stress test and progressively worsening DOE and weakness now in CCU s/p complicated access and failure of closure device.
She does have BP, but this is consistent w/ her prior LBP.
No echymoses at flanks/thigh.
# CORONARIES: Progressively worsening angina, now asymptomatic at rest s/p DES to LAD.
# PUMP:  No evidence of CHF clinically since reperfusion with stent, able to walk on her own with SOB, likely has both systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
AV delay could perhaps be changed as outpatient to maximize ventricular filling and outflow.
# Hypothyroidism.
# Osteoporosis.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: CAD with coronary stenting  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
During the procedure there was concern for possible bleeding into your abdomen.
There was no evidence for ongoing bleeding and you were discharged home.
Please call you doctor/and or return to the Emergency room if you experience back pain or you feel dizzy or lightheaded or have chest pain or pressure.
