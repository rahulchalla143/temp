Afib, but poor baseline, irreg, irreg .
Radiology: CXR: No pneumothorax or infiltrate detected.
Femur:Angulated fracture of the distal right femoral diaphysis.
Unusual cortical contour involving the posterior diaphysis of the left femur, assessed only on a single view.
Old right femur intratrochanteric fracture .
Without prevertebral soft tissue swelling these are likely chronic in nature, however, acute subluxation cannot be completely excluded.
Degenerative cervical spine changes as noted above.
4 cm nodular lesion of the left lobe of the thyroid with calcification within.
Opacification of some of the mastoid air cells bilaterally without fracture identified.
Recommend clinical correlation to rule out fracture in this region.
CT head: Multiple hypodensities involving the subcortical white matter and cortex bilaterally, likely representing infarcts.
The attenuation values of these lesions suggest that they are subacute, however, this is not definite.
The most recent of these infarcts appears to be located in the right temporoparietal lobe.
Opacification of some of the mastoid air cells noted bilaterally without evidence of obvious fracture.
There  is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation.
(3+) mitral regurgitation.
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CT abd/pelvis: 1)  Right-sided dynamic hip screw for old right intratrochanteric fracture with recent placement of right intramedullary nail for right distal femoral fracture 2) Old left intratrochanteric fracture.
3)  Ventral hernia and stoma in LIF.
4)  Subcutaneous edema and third spacing   Brief Hospital Course: 89 yo woamn with Right femur fracture and Altered mental status.
# Femur fracture: Leg was immobilized and the patient was taken to OR for IM rod placement on [**12-4**].
She did have likely bleeding into this leg and at [**Hospital1 18**] has required 2U pRBCs pre-op and 2U pRBCs postop (last tx on [**12-6**]).
She was not started on post hip fx anticoagulation due to concern of questionable hemorrhagic conversion of subacute strokes.
Additionally, the patient was noted to have L hip pain and a hip film appears to show a l hip fracture as well.
The cause for her hypotension was unclear; she was started on antibiotics empirically for sepsis; [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was equivocal so she was started on hydrocortisone.
Her hydrocortisone was d/c'd when sepsis appeared less likely.
Because of her + cardiac enzymes an eccho was ordered which showed severe valvluar regurgiation (3+TR; 3+MR; 1+ AR) which likely contributed to her hypotension.
Due to concern of total body fluid overload ([**Location (un) **]-sarca) with hypotension, low urine output, and very low albumin the patient was given several days of IV albumin which temporarily improved her blood pressure and allowed diuresis.
However, she eventually developed refractory hypotension with Afib with RVR, from which she eventually expired.
# CHF: As above Ms [**Known lastname **] was noted to have severe valvular regurgitation on Eccho (3+MR; 3+ TR; 1+ AR; preserved LVEF).
Because of hypotension it was difficult to consistenly diurese Ms. [**Known lastname **].
She was briefly on nitropase and hydralazine when hypertensive for afterload reduction but the patient quickly became normo/hypotense and these medications were discontinued.
As mentioined above she developed refractory hypotension with worsening hypoxia and annasarca.
# Arrhythmia: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with HR in the 100-120 range.
She eventually developed rapid a fib which was unable to be controlled due to her hypotension.
Her EKG...Eccho did not reveal any wall motion abnormalities.
Medical therapy was limited given her hypotension and bleeding; she is on .
Genral surgery was consulted, and agreed that the wound was healing well, with no further interventions needed.
A wound culture was taken from the wound, and it was monitored for signs of infection.
# ARF: elevated creatinine from baseline of 0.9 several years prior from NH.
# Anasarca: in the context of fluid resuscitation, hypoalbuminemia and ARF.
DIuresis with lasix was attempted, but limited by patient's low blood pressures.
# Mental status change: Improved post-op, but waxed and waned in a delirium like fashion.
At approximately 1715 on [**2120-12-10**], the patient had an acute decompensation of unresponsiveness, bradycardia and hypotension.
