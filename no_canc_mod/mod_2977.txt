>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. [Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or Lactobacillus sp.]
Stable small nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis on the left.
Increased size of simple intra-abdominal ascites as compared to [**2172-2-2**].
No evidence of intrahepatic mass.
No intra- or retro-peritoneal hemorrhage.
Interval resolution of anterior abdominal wall subcutaneous collection.
[**2172-6-4**] CXR: Continued opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis and small effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 55yo female w HCV cirrhosis, previously compensated with recent decompensation after [**12/2171**] cholecystectomy, being worked up for transplant, admitted with presumed SBP for antibiotic therapy.
#SBP: The patient was admitted with fevers, increased abdominal distension.
RUQ U/S and CT abdomen did not reveal any obvious signs of intra-abdominal bleeding.
She remained on Zosyn to cover possible SBP as well as HCAP (see below).
This was thought to be related to her liver failure vs. early DIC in the setting of infection.
#PNA: Initially, during her ICU course, the patient developed worsening respiratory status.
Given radiologic findings, this was thought to be related to fluid overload vs. compressive atelectasis [**12-24**] ascites vs pneumonia.
Her respiratory symptoms began to improved.
Her vancomycin and cipro were stopped as discussed above, and the patient was continued on pip-tazo to cover possible SBP as well as HCAP.
She remained with mild residual cough improved with PRN benzonatate.
An EGD was performed on this hospitalization, demonstrating no varices.
During this hospitalization, she had a mild rise in LFTs, thought to be [**12-24**] to zosyn, which resolved after discontinuation of the zosyn.
#Hematemesis: After placement of dobhoff tube, pt had single episode of emesis with several small blood clots.
Dobhoff was pulled and NGtube was placed for gastric lavage, which did not demonstrate further signs of active bleeding.
The EGD did not reveal any varices or signs of bleeding.
#Nutrition: Patient reported poor appetite and weight loss over the year prior to her admission.

Discharge Instructions: Ms [**Known lastname **], You were admitted to the hospital for increasing abdominal pain and fluid accumulation.
You were found to have low blood pressure and infections, and were sent to the ICU for a period of time.
You should continue taking this because there was chronic inflammation seen in your stomach, when you underwent upper endoscopy.
You therefore do not need to take daily potassium tablets at this time but you should have your level checked by your physician at your next visit--furosemide and spironolactone can affect your potassium levels.
