Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old male with Type 2 DM, lung disease on 2L home O2, and ESRD (recently started on HD in [**2115-5-7**]) who presents with fever and chills at dialysis complicated by hypotension.
Subsequently, he underwent TEE, which did not show any evidence of vavular vegitations or abscesses.
While on antibiotics, should have weekly CBC, LFT's, and blood chemistries for the next 3 weeks, or until instructed to stop by PCP or Renal Doctors.
# HTN/dCHF/right heart failure (EF>55%): Held metoprolol while hypotensive, but continued aspirin 81 mg daily.
# Rheumatoid arthritis: No active issues on this admisison.
# Hx Pulmonary Embolism on Coumadin: Emailed Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7841**] [**Name (STitle) 7842**] and told her we aren't bridging coumadin and ask if she objects for any reason - she does not know PMH and could not get records.
# ESRD: Recieved most of dialysis session prior to MICU transfer.
# EKG changes: Has baseline right bundle branch block, but did have deeper ST segments in anterolateral distribution in the setting of hypotension and tachycardia.
Likely rate related changes vs lead placement.
# Hypophosphatemia: Resolved.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 4587**],  You were recently admitted to [**Hospital1 1170**] for treatment of fevers and chills.
While you were hospitalized, you were found to have bacteria in your blood, likely from your dialysis catheter.
During your hospitalization, you developed low blood pressure, requiring a brief stay in the medical ICU.
The cause of this low blood pressure was likely the infection in your blood.
During your ICU stay, you were on medications to treat your low blood pressure, and you improved.
Also, while you were hospitalized, it was observed that you developed a rash following exposure to products used to clean your skin, including betadine and chloraprep.
