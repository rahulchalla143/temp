CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left inner thigh pain and swelling.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88 year old white female status post left femoral-DP bypass graft in [**2121-5-12**] with vein patch angioplasty in [**2121-8-12**], who presented to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2123-1-14**], with pain at the site of a bone marrow biopsy for aplastic anemia.
She developed temperatures with a temperature maximum of 102.0 F. with increasing left thigh erythema, swelling and tenderness.
Ultrasound was done which was negative for fluid collection.
A repeat ultrasound was done on the 8th which showed a pseudo-aneurysm, query graft infection.
The patient is known to have a Pseudomonas urinary tract infection which is treated with Ceftazidine.
Peripheral vascular disease status post fem-DP bypass     graft in [**2121-4-12**].
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery     bypass graft times four in [**2117**].
History of myocardial infarction prior to coronary artery     bypass graft.
History of creatinine renal insufficiency with a baseline     creatinine of 2.0.
There is no jugular venous distention.
Musculoskeletal examination shows a left inner thigh erythema, swelling and redness.
Chest x-ray showed a cardiomegaly with upper zone re-distribution.
Ultrasound of the thigh was negative for deep venous thrombosis and echocardiogram was obtained which showed an ejection fraction of 60% with two to three plus mitral regurgitation.
Ultrasound of the affected leg was inconclusive regarding a pseudo-aneurysm.
The patient underwent, on [**2123-1-21**], a left extra-acomic bypass with thrombectomy of the femoral-DP bypass graft of left less saphenous vein, ligation and drainage of an infected pseudo-aneurysm.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition and then was transferred to the SICU for continued monitoring care secondary to coagulopathy and neutropenia.
Ultimate recommendations of Rheumatology were Prednisone course and tapered as they felt that she would be at high risk for use of Colchicine secondary to her bone marrow suppression.
She did have a temperature elevation of 101.7 F., that defervesced to 100.7 F.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained.
A chest x-ray was obtained without evidence of focal consolidation.
During the postoperative period, the patient had acceleration of her renal dysfunction with a peak creatinine of 3.4 post-fever.
It was secondary to a yeast urinary tract infection.
She also was growing Pseudomonas from her wound and her antibiotics were converted to Ciprofloxacin.
[**Name2 (NI) **] SMA glomerular dilatation rate was less than 20.
Possible consideration of the membranous glomerular nephritis and amyloidosis.
The patient required multiple medication adjustments for her systolic and diastolic hypertension.
On postoperative day her blood pressure remained elevated and required adjustments in her Norvasc and was converted to Cardura.
The patient continued to show clinical improvement both in her erythema and pain in the left toe and renal function.
She underwent, on [**2123-2-4**], a left first toe amputation without complications and tolerated the procedure well.
The wound was primarily closed.
Her groin wound on the left side showed some base residual necrosis but was granulating at the edges.
Infected pseudo-aneurysm status post excision.
Chronic renal insufficiency, etiology undetermined.
