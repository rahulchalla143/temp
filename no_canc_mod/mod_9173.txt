Films taken there suggestive of an elevated/disrupted left hemidiaphragm.
Postoperatively, the patient experienced a few episodes of atrial fibrillation which were broken with lopressor.
The patient also ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
Both chest tubes were removed and, five days after presentation, the patient required thoracentesis for a large pleural effusion.
Postoperatively, she had a few more episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was quickly converted with intravenous Lopressor.
Fifteen days after initial presentation, the patient was noted to be short of breath and tachypneic, with oxygen saturations in the 80s.
A CT angio showed no evidence for pulmonary embolus, but did show a large left loculated pleural effusion and a smaller right pleural effusion.
The patient at this time was being treated with levofloxacin day four for her left lobe pneumonia.
On the following day, a left posterior chest tube was again placed, with 730 cc of serosanguinous fluid immediately draining.
At the time of transfer, the patient reports slight shortness of breath, denies dizziness, headache, chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills and palpitations.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis, hairline fracture of the right hip, status post bilateral cataract surgery, congenital lymphedema of both lower extremities.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER:  Regular insulin sliding scale, acetaminophen 325 to 650 mg by mouth every four to six hours as needed for pain, albuterol nebulizers every four to six hours as needed, Atrovent nebulizers every six hours, Tylenol #3 one to two tablets by mouth every four to six hours as needed for pain, Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day, Dulcolax 10 mg per rectum per day as needed, milk of magnesia 30 cc by mouth every six hours as needed, Senna one tablet by mouth twice a day as needed, Miconazole powder 2% applied topically three times a day under the breasts, levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth every 24 hours, thyroid 60 mg by mouth once daily, heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every eight hours, metoprolol 25 mg by mouth twice a day, ondansetron 2 mg intravenously every six hours as needed for nausea and vomiting.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No icterus, no pallor, mucous membranes moist, no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.
Neurological:  No sensory or motor deficit.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no rubs, gallops or murmurs.
No jugular venous distention.
Massive bilateral lower extremity edema secondary to congenital lymphedema.
Pulmonary:  Lungs clear to auscultation, with mild scattered rales.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, no organomegaly, no masses.
STUDIES:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no acute ischemic changes.
Ultrasound immediately prior to transfer showed no evidence for deep venous thrombosis.
Echocardiogram obtained four days after initial presentation showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60 to 70%, with only mild mitral regurgitation and mild dilation of the left atrium.
The patient had no acute events on telemetry, and was in normal sinus rhythm the whole time.
The patient's TSH came back mildly elevated at 6, and her thyroid supplementation was increased.
One morning a few days after transfer to the floor, the patient complained of acute shortness of breath and chest pain.
She was found to be in acute pulmonary edema.
Her symptoms resolved, and she ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
Electrocardiogram was normal when compared to a prior study, and showed no acute ischemic changes.
The patient was also found to have a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase, which was attributed to her multiple injuries.
Left diaphragmatic rupture status post diaphragm repair 2.
Left pneumothorax 3.
Bilateral pulmonary contusions 5.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; the patient is to be discharged wearing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor 7.
Congenital lymphedema  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets by mouth every four to six hours as needed for pain 3.
