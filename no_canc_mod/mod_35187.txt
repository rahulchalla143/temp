Admission Date:  [**2183-6-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-6-27**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Large Left cerebellar hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**6-9**]: Suboccipital craniotomy for hematoma evacuation and placement of EVD   History of Present Illness: 84F who presented to OSH after a two day history of nausea and vomiting.
She went to the ED earlier this evening for ongoing nausea and vomiting and increased drowsiness, with an "inability" to get OOB.

Brisk corneals, +gag to deep suction with associated facial grimacing.
Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered within the left cerebellar hemisphere with associated effacement of the fourth ventricle and quadrigeminal plate cistern.
Encephalomalacia within the left frontal lobe.
evidence for embolic stroke.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 84 year old woman with possible history of PFO/embolic stroke, previously on coumadin admitted with left cerebellar hemorrhage, s/p evacuation.
evidence for embolic stroke.
HISTORY: History of embolic stroke on Coumadin, left cerebellar hemorrhage status post evacuation and change in mental status.
There are encephalomalacic and gliotic changes in the left cerebellum with blood products relating to a hematoma evacuation.
There is no significant mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
Old infarction in the left frontal lobe is again noted.
There is a focus of restricted diffusion in the right thalamus, which is probably related to old hemorrhage in this site.
There is an apparent focus of restricted diffusion in the right frontal lobe, which is quite small.
There is no significant associated mass effect.
There is no midline shift.
There is evidence for prior hemorrhage or blood products in the right putamen, caudate and to a lesser extent, the left basal ganglia.
There is bilateral mastoid opacification.
These are likely related to atherosclerotic disease.
Bilateral distal PCA irregularity and narrowing is also noted.
IMPRESSION: Moderate small vessel ischemic sequela.
Small focus of restricted diffusion in the right frontal white matter, which could represent a subacute infarction.
There is no associated mass effect or midline shift.
Atherosclerotic narrowing in the circle of [**Location (un) 431**], which does not appear to be hemodynamically significant.
aspiration, ?
aspiration, ?
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW INDICATION: 84-year-old woman with intracranial hemorrhage, presenting with aspiration.
ORAL PHASE: There is moderate impairment of bolus formation and prolongation of the mastication.
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is mild delay in swallow initiation and mild reduction in laryngeal valve closure.
Mild coating remains in the valleculae after solid food and purees.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: There is intermittent penetration before the swallow with thin liquids, no aspiration was seen today.
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia but improved from previous video swallow, resulting in intermittent penetration with thin liquids, no aspiration was seen today.
EEG: FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent bursts of mixed frequency generalized slowing.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were also bursts of mixed frequency slowing seen bilaterally and independently in temporal areas or a bit more broadly, with a mild rightsided emphasis.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to drowsiness but did not appear to enter stage II of sleep during this recording.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the multifocal slowing described above.
This suggests multifocal subcortical dysfunction.
Vascular disease is the most common cause at this age.
Nevertheless, there were no areas of very prominent and fixed focal slowing.
There were no epileptiform features.
[**6-10**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is markedly dilated The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Mild aortic regurgitation, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Markedly dilated ascending aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: 84F with h/o stroke and temporal arteritis admitted with cerebellar hemorrhage, s/p evacuation, transferred to MICU after code blue in setting of AVNRT, required intubation for airway protection, rapidly extubated.
After transfer to general medical floor she had a recurrent episode of AVNRT prompting transfer to the cardiology service.
# S/p cerebellar hemorrhage: s/p evacuation on [**6-9**].
Has been stable, on head CT [**6-25**], no evidence of recurrent bleed or hydrocephalus.
Amiodarone was started, but discontinued after 3 days due to concerns for mental status changes.
-Head CT negative for bleed or hydrocephalus.
Per son pt had an embolic stroke ~ 10 years ago and was on coumadin for a possible "hole in her heart."
No PFO seen on in house TTE although no bubble study was performed.
Acute infarct unlikely giving lack of focality of symptoms and waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] of MS, MRI shows no evidence of acute infarct.
No seizure seen on EEG, findings more consistent with multifocal cortical dysfunction likely attributable to vascular disease.
- TSH slightly elevated, FT4 WNL, c/w subclinical hypothyroidism, to follow up as outpatient and consider possible initiation of replacement therapy -no evidence of ongoing infection on CXR or repeat UA.
# HTN: Blood pressure well controlled on new regimen of lisinopril at 40 mg qday, toprol, verapamil SR  # UTI: Completed 7 day course of cefpodixime for cipro resistant catheter associated e.coli UTI.
Concerning for COPD/reactive airway disease.
Sputum gram stain c/w oropharyngeal flora - Pt on high dose steroids for presumed COPD exacerbation, has completed taper and is  back to home dose of 5mg maintenance.
- Nebs prn - has completed 5 days of azithromycin for possible COPD exacerbation.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
Some of your medications have been changed: Your warfarin has been stopped, please discuss whether to restart this with your cardiologist You have been started on the following medications -Toprol XL 200mg daily -Aspirin 81mg daily -Verapamil 240mg daily -Lisinopril 40mg daily -Vitamin D -Multivitamin  Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you develop any change in your sensation, strength, speech or vision, or if you have palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, loss of consiousness or fever or for any other concerning symptom.
