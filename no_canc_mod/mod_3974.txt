Admission Date:  [**2181-5-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2181-5-26**]   Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 year old [**Doctor First Name **] speaking gentleman with a history of severe interstitial lung disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease and chronic renal failure who experienced worsening shortness of breath over the day prior to admission.
The patient at home had oxygen saturations in the 70s on 3.5 liters by nasal cannula and right-sided chest pain.
In the Emergency Room the patient was diagnosed with presumed congestive heart failure exacerbation and worsening of his interstitial lung disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was well-appearing elderly man in mild respiratory distress.
Neck, notable for jugulovenous distension and tenderness in his right calf.
His chest showed audible crackles bilaterally but cleared anteriorly.
His cardiac examination was normal S1 and S2, II/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex.
His abdomen was benign with mild hepatomegaly.
His extremities showed trace bilateral pedal edema and neurologically he was intact.
LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had an elevated white count of 19.1, hematocrit of 38.4, platelets 264.
His electrocardiogram was ventricularly paced in 70's, no ischemic changes.
His chest x-ray showed diffuse alveolar interstitial changes, likely superimposed congestive heart failure or interstitial lung disease.
Pulmonary - The patient suffers from respiratory distress, likely secondary to both congestive heart failure and worsening of his interstitial lung disease.
This has been an acute and chronic progression of this disease which is likely a terminal process.
Despite aggressive treatment with Prednisone and antibiotics, the patient was aggressively diuresed for congestive heart failure component, continued on his Prednisone and treated with Nitroglycerin drip, Captopril, Digoxin, Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone and Morphine.
He continued to have significant oxygen requirement and intermittently complained of shortness of breath.
After extensive conversations with the family it was agreed that the patient would be taken home for home hospice care given the likely terminal prognosis and progression of his interstitial lung disease and congestive heart failure, and the fact that there was little medical treatment that we could provide at this point to cure this condition.
Cardiac - The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.
When the Nitroglycerin drip was turned initially the patient experienced some right-sided neck pain and chest tenderness that possibly could have been ischemic in origin.
The patient requires aggressive treatment with Morphine, Nitroglycerin and ACE inhibitor to minimize his discomfort related to the ischemic pain.
In addition, the patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which was supertherapeutic in his INR.
Severe interstitial lung disease 2.
Congestive heart failure 3.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 4.
Hypertension 5.
Chronic renal insufficiency  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
Nitroglycerin patch 0.6 mg per hour, transdermal to be changed every 24 hours, titrate to no chest pain 6.
2 hours as needed for shortness of breath, cough or pain 11.
4-6 hours as needed for fever and pain 13.
4-6 hours prn anxiety and restlessness 14.
4 hours prn nausea and vomiting  FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient will have hospice care at home.
