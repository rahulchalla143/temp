He was also noted to be unresponsive and febrile today, brought in to outside hospital, where he was found to be hypotensive (responded to 2.5L of IVFs), he had a WBC count of 39K and a Creatinine of 5.5.
He was found to have UTI thought to be secondary to urinary retention.
There was some question as to whether etiology could have been related to progression of his primary encephalopathy with dysautonomia vs. potential psychiatric medication side effect vs BPH.
