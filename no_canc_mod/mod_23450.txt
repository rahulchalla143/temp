Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with LMCA that was free of obstructive disease.
LAD had a mid 50-60% lesion and a D2 had a 60% lesion (non-hemodynamically significant).
The RCA had a 100% proximal thrombotic occlusion.
Hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated systemic pressures.
There was near equalization of left and right sided filling pressures consistent with RV infarct physiology (RAp 18 mm Hg and PCWP 19 mm Hg).
The RCA acute TO was predilated with a 2.5 X 15mm Voyager balloon, stented with a 4.0 X 18mm Driver stent and post dilated with a 4.5 X 15mm maverick balloon with lesion reduction from 100 % to 0%.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection and no embolisation.
Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
[**2132-5-19**] Echocardiography: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the basal 2/3rds of the inferior and inferolarteral walls.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
No aneurysm identified.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 54 year old gentleman with type II DM, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented to OSH with chest pain and found to have ST elevation in the inferior leads.
Time between onset of symptoms and intervention approximately 2 hours.
Post catheterization echocardiography revealed an EF of 40% with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
His respiratory status also remained within normal limits and there were no clinical signs of heart failure.
There was concern for a bruit at his right groin catheterization site; ultrasound of that area revealed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
The patient was discharged on HD 4 having been chest pain free and hemodynamically stable since his catheterization.
In summary, this is a 54 year old gentleman with DM II, hyperlipidemia, and HTN who presented with acute inferoposterior STEMI with proximal RCA TO.
He underwent successful bare metal stent placement to the proximal RCA with resolution of chest pain and ST elevations.
He remained chest pain free and hemodynamically stable afterwards.
VSS, no vagal symptoms on transfer.
2) Pump: EF 35% with inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
On discharge the pt appeared euvolemic, no symptoms or signs of failure.
3) Rhythm remained NSR - Metoprolol - [**Month (only) 116**] need ICD in future if EF further deteriorates .
5) T2DM: - A1C mildly elevated - continue metformin for now, may need more aggressive regimen - Holding metformin in acute setting - SSI maintained in hospital .
Medications on Admission: Metformin 500mg PO bid Lisinopril 40mg PO qD Norvasc ?
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ST elevated myocardial infarction, inferolateral region.
Free of chest pain.
No clinical signs of heart failure.
Discharge Instructions: Immediately seek medical attention should you experience chest pain or shortness of breath.
