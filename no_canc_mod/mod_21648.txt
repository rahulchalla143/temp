Admission Date:  [**2173-9-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-10-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2151-6-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: headache, neck pain, chills  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture x 2   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 22y/o M from [**Country 11150**] who presented to an OSH today with a 10 day history of persistent headache, neck pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, and generalized fatigue and malaise.
The patient first noticed these symptoms ten days PTA with the insidious onset of headache and lethargy.
The symptoms were initially accompanied by nausea and vomiting.
The patient states that the symptoms went largely unchanged for most of the remainder of the time PTA, until roughly one day ago the nausea and vomiting went away and the headache began to get worse, accompanied by severe neck stiffness and pain with hip flexion.
The patient began to notice that loud noises made his head hurt worse, and that moving his eyes exacerbated his pain.
Throughout this period he continued to have fevers with shaking chills and sweats.
[**Name (NI) **] is unaware of PPD status or of having received BCG vaccine.
The patient denies sick contacts, environmental exposures, or unusual PO intake.
The patient has had no sexual contacts.
The patient does not use EtOH, tobacco, or illicits.
Tenderness with evaluation of extraocular muscles.
No palatal petichiae or tonsillar exudate.
Anicteric sclerae.
NECK: supple, no supraclavicular or cervical LAD.
Exquisite tenderness to palpation in dorsal cervical midline.
No M/R/G appreciated.
No masses or HSM.
SKIN: no rashes, no petichiae, palms and soles specifically evaluated.
CSF Results: LP #1: From OSH - CSF culture - no growth, Fungal cultures - preliminary no growth, AFB cultures pending Serologies - Lyme negative, Enterovirus negative .
CSF [**9-28**]: gram stain negative; cultures negative todate, fungal culture pending, AFB pending Stool cultures - C. Diff negative, O&P pending, marcoscopic - no worms .
Imaging: CXR [**9-24**]: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
_______________________________ CT HEAD [**9-25**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect.
No evidence of enhancing lesions, or meningeal enhancement.
______________________________ KUB [**9-25**]: The bowel gas pattern is nonspecific and nonobstructive with no evidence for free air, pneumatosis or ascites.
There is no slow diffusion, susceptibility artifact, or areas of abnormal enhancement.
There is an isolated punctate focus of elevated T2/FLAIR signal in the periventricular white matter of the left parietal lobe, likely of little clinical significance.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarction, an infectious process, or an enhancing mass lesion.
____________________________ MRI Lumbar Spine [**9-27**]: Vertebral body height, alignment, and signal intensity are normal.
There is no paraspinal or epidural soft tissue enhancing masses.
There is no spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal stenosis.
There is diffuse, marked leptomeningeal enhancement of the conus medullaris and the cauda equina nerve rootlets.
No definite enhancing leptomeningeal nodules are appreciated.
This finding can be seen in diffuse meningeal infection as provided by history.
Other differential diagnostic consideration would include metastatic disease.
_________________________ MRI Thoracic Spine [**9-27**]: The study is technically limited due to extreme patient motion and is suboptimal for adequate evaluation of the thoracic spine.
There is some suggestion of abnormal spinal cord enhancement along its surface, but this is difficult to fully characterize given the poor resolution due to motion degradation and the lack of axial images.
Also, there is some suggestion of increased abnormal STIR signal intensity from the T6-T9 levels in the left paraspinal musculature with mild corresponding enhancement, but this evaluation too is limited due to lack of axial images or adequate resolution.
No definite paraspinal fluid collection is seen.
IMPRESSION: Technically limited and suboptimal study for adequate evaluation of the thoracic spine.
Possible abnormalities as described above need repeat imaging for adequate interpretation.
________________________ EKG [**9-28**]: Regular narrow complex tachycardia - may be sinus tachycardia but consider also atrial flutter with 2:1 response Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes No previous tracing for comparison _______________________ ECHO [**9-29**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
_______________________ CT OF THE ABDOMEN [**9-29**]: The imaged portions of the lung bases are clear with no opacities, effusions, or nodules identified.
The liver appears normal with no focal lesions identified.
There is no mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is no free fluid in the abdomen.
The small bowel appears unremarkable.
However, there is no sign of any periappendiceal fat stranding or fluid.
This may be consistent with a very early appendicitis.
The terminal ileum and cecum are unremarkable, which suggests no tuberculosis involvement.
The distal ureters and bladder appear normal.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis or lymphadenopathy.
No radiographic evidence of tuberculosis involvement in the abdomen.
_____________________ Repeat CT Abdomen and Pelvis [**9-30**]: normal contrast filling the apendix, no acute change.
______________________ LENIs: no DVTs in lower extremities, bilaterally   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 22 man, native of [**Country 11150**], with no significant PMHx admitted with meningitis/encephalitis presumed to be Tuberculous meningitis.
Patient then developed photophobia overnight and became increasingly lethargic, with waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.
Also, patient was noted to have new abdominal tenderness not noted on previous exams.
Given the patient's worsening mental status including increasing lethargy and new-onset photophobia without focal CNIII deficits, patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for further management.
Meningitis/Fever - Patient's history, physical exam, and LP results from the OSH and repeated at [**Hospital1 18**] were concerning for bacterial meningitis with very high opening pressures, although the time course was somewhat more prolonged than would be expected for a bacterial process.
Gram staining was negative, but showed a relative preponderance of lymphocytes with high protein levels making a viral process or TB higher on the differential diagnosis.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to have photophobia with waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status although his WBC steadily trended downwards.
He continued to show signs of increased intracranial pressure with CN VI palsy bilaterally, ?CN IV palsy and sluggish pupils.
The patient continued to have headache, back pain and positive Kernig's sign.
Repeat LP was performed as per ID recommendations which again showed a lymphocytic predominance with decreasing levels of protein and increasing glucose.
He continued to have a left sided CN VI palsy on lateral gave but his pupils were more reactive.
Pt continued to have periods of severe headache, back pain and leg pain throughout his admission, treated with acetaminophen, oxycodone and IV morphine as needed.
Droplet precautions and negative pressure isolation was discontinued as the patient has no signs or symptoms or active TB.
MRI of the head was also performed which did not reveal any evidence of TB or other abnormalities.
No source of infection was immediately apparent, so, since patient is at an increased risk for DVT (due to LE paraplegia), bilateral LENIs were ordered and were negative for DVT bilaterally.
DDx for the fevers included atelectasis and incentive spirometer was placed at patient's bedside.
Lower Extremity Weakness - On admission to the ICU, the patient was acutely ill and remained in bed with altered mental status.
With improving mental status the patient was found to have b/l lower extremity weakness.
There was at no time any saddle anesthesia or incontinence although the patient did have one episode of severe diarrhea as a result of aggressive bowel regimen for constipation.
MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine revealed leptomeningeal enhancement of the conus medullaris and cauda equina in the setting of diffuse meningeal irritation.
There was question of a paraspinal soft tissue enhancement poorly seen on MR of the thoracic spine.
These findings supported meningeal irritation of the cord as a cause for this patient's lower extremities weakness, with a combination of upper and lower motor neuron findings due to involvement of the conus medullaris.
Neurology was consulted who suggested continued treatment of the underlying infection and continued steroids.
CT of the abdomen/pelvis did not reveal any involvement of the paraspinal musculature or soft tissues.
Abdominal Pain - Initially the patient had one episode of abdominal pain with nausea/vomiting and decreased appetite.
His abdomen remained soft, mildly tender, with no rebound or guarding.
Abdominal x-ray did not reveal any free air or obstruction.
This resolved and the patient continued to have good PO intake without abdominal pain.
He did not have an acute abdomen on physical examination.
This was thought to be due to constipation as the patient had not had a bowel movement for several days.
The patient was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen including PR lactulose which caused the patient to have a large quantity of loose stool.
After this the patient continued to have an appetite with good PO intake but continued to complain of diffuse abdominal pain.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with oral and IV contrast which showed a filling defect in the appendix with a thickened wall suggestive of appendicitis.
Surgery consult was placed who recommended repeat imaging of the abdomen due to the suboptimal quality of the first study which did not show filling of the cecum.
The patient remained without an acute abdomen throughout, WBC count was steadily decreasing, fever curve decreasing.
The suspicion for TB enteritis or lymphadenopathy causing appendiceal obstruction remained.
Urinary retention- At OSH, pt was found to have urinary retention, requiring a foley.
Likely related to conus syndrome as above.
Voiding trial was attempted once more, but the patient began to experience severe abdominal pain several hours after the foley was removed.
Patient complained of inability to pass urine, the foley was placed back in and 750cc of urine came out while abdominal pain resolved.
Tachycardia - The patient was in sinus tachycardia beginning [**9-27**] which persisted and reached a maximum HR of 160s.
This was thought to be due to his underlying infection with persistent low grade fevers.
The patient was anxious and having at times severe headaches, back ache and leg pain.
In addition, he was treated with Ativan for anxiety, Percocet and Morphine for pain which also seemed to slow his heart rate.
Notably, the patient's heart rate decreased during sleep and increased during the daytime, likely as a result of anxiety.
However, patient has a h/o of urinary retention while being in in the hospital, so he should be evaluated for urine output frequently.
Cerebral salt wasting: Initially the patient was thought to have SIADH with low serum sodium levels likely due to his underlying CNS infection.
24h urinary sodium secretion was above normal suggesting cerebral salt wasting as the cause for his low sodium.
8.Prophylaxis: Heparin SC, pneumo boots due to high risk of DVT with LE weakness.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety.
