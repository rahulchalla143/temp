Admission Date:  [**2175-11-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-11-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-11-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2927**] Chief Complaint: Purulent drainage at left craniotomy site  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploration/Washout of Left craniotomy site  History of Present Illness: HPI: The patient is a 57 year old right handed man with a history of Wilson's disease c/b seizure disorder s/p left frontal craniotomy with anterior left frontal lobectomy [**4-/2164**], arachnoid cyst in resection cavity s/p stereotactic cyst ventriculostomy [**8-30**] with insertion of Rickham catheter c/b infection and Rickham catheter removal [**2175-9-30**] who presented with infected surgical wound s/p washout today, now with post-operative seizures.
The patient is s/p surgical wound washout today for drainage from the incision site (see full details below).
At 8:15 pm, he had a seizure with left gaze deviation and raising his left arm in the air lasting approximately 1 minute.
There was no shaking of his arms or legs and no loss of bowel/bladder function.
Neurology was consulted and immediately came to the bedside at 9:10 pm, by which time the patient was no longer seizing.
Prior to having his recent Rickham catheter placement, his seizures were difficult to control and were occuring daily.
He has had no further seizures since the Rickham catheter was removed by Neurosurgery on [**2175-9-30**] (see below).
He has previously had depth electrode placement in 1/98 which EEG monitoring revealed that all of his seizures initiated from the left cingulate gyrus recording area, the more superficial contacts more involved than the deep contacts.
He was most recently admitted to Neurology [**Date range (1) **]/09 with increase seizure frequency.
EEG showed spikes and sharp discharges seen focally and independently in the right frontal and central areas much more than in the left central area, and only a few discharges seen in the left temporal region.
EEG [**9-9**] showed 20 pushbutton events of turning to the left which had EEG correlate of a rhythmic sharp activity seen in the right frontal area.
EEG [**9-10**] showed 19 pushbutton events for unresponsiveness and behavioral arrest correlated with sharp rhythmic activity seen in the right frontal area reflected of the central areas and the left frontal area lasting for up to 20-30 seconds.
EEG on [**9-13**] showed 22 pushbutton activations for events for clinical seizures of either turning to the left or the right which were most of the time correlated with rhythmic sharp activity in the right fronto-temporal areas.
He was initially started on rufinamide; however, the patient had multiple seizures after discontinuing EEG monitoring so the rufinadmide was discontinued.
MRI head was read as "stable left extraaxial fluid collection", but the team was concerned that his left frontal cyst had slightly enlarged and may have been causing pressure on his parenchyma.
He did have increased seizures post-operatively, but this was thought to be due to missing his morning AEDs.
He complained of vertical diplopia, which was thought to be a Depakote side effect.
He was readmitted to Neurosurgery [**Date range (1) 110890**] with purulent drainage and erythema at the surgical incision.
He also had GTC seizures and was loaded with Dilantin (which was not continued), and Neurology was consulted that admission.
Past Medical History: -Wilson's disease c/b seizure disorder s/p left frontal craniotomy with anterior left frontal lobectomy [**4-/2164**] -Arachnoid cyst in resection cavity s/p stereotactic cyst ventriculostomy [**8-30**] with insertion of Rickham catheter c/b infection and Rickham catheter removal [**2175-9-30**] -Pulmonary empyema -Pneumothorax   Social History: He lives alone with supervision and a housekeeper.
Physical Exam: VS: temp 99, bp 103/46, HR 84, RR 14, SaO2 100% on 2L Genl: Awake, sleepy, NAD HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, no conjunctival injection, oropharynx clear CV: Regular rate, Nl S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriorly and laterally, no wheezes, rhonchi, rales Abd: +BS, soft, ND abdomen, diffusely tender to palpation  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake but sleepy, cooperative with exam, pleasant.
Palate elevation symmetric.
No significant change in size of the small lentiform left frontal extra-axial collection, with stable hyperattenuating deep and superficial margins of uniform thickness.
This corresponds to the uniformly enhancing rim on the most recent study, likely representing an organizing lining capsule.
New interval foci of air at the site of left frontal burr hole, likely from recent "wound wash-out" with persistent focal soft tissue thickening at the site of the burr hole.
MRI head [**2175-11-10**]; lentiform 5.1cm (TRV) extra-axial fluid collection, L frontal region.
likely = post-procedure seroma w/complex contents, but no specific evid infxn (would have to aspirate, to be sure).
post-op dural enhcmt, but no leptomening enhcmt.
Due to concern of osteomyelitis of the skull, he will need at least six weeks of vancomycin.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 931**] House Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 932**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Wound infection Exacerbation of epilepsy   Discharge Condition: A&Ox3, naming, repetition and comprehension intact.
Mild L NLF.
Brisk reflexes but symmetric.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
