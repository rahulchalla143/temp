Patient noted to be cyanotic appearing with minimal breath sounds.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral fluffy infiltrates.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Scleroderma, Raynaud's, end-stage renal disease, arthritis status post atrial myxoma removal, questionable asthma, questionable hip fracture.
Skin appears tight, grayish color; no rash.
Chest with decreased breath sounds anteriorly and laterally at the bases with wheezing.
Cardiovascular is tachy; frequent ectopy; no murmurs; hyperdynamic.
No lower extremity edema.
LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray showed bilateral diffuse infiltrates, neurovascular redistribution.
In terms of etiology of patient's respiratory failure, she underwent a CTA which revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, but there was evidence of large bilateral effusions as well as extensive subcutaneous edema and ascites.
It was felt that fluid overload and congestive heart failure may have been the cause of patient's decompensation.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which revealed severe global hypo/akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of approximately 20 to 25 percent.
Patient has a questionable allergy to her ACE inhibitor and also was having difficulty taking pills and thus intravenous and transdermal medications were used.
Additionally, patient has an extremely low albumin due to malnutrition and felt that this was contributing to her anasarca and pleural effusions.
In terms of other possible etiologies, an induced sputum for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was sent and is pending at the time of this dictation, and patient was treated with Levaquin for a question of possible pneumonia.
Clostridium difficile colitis:  Patient had extensive diarrhea during her hospital stay.
Dysphagia:  Patient had extensive difficulties with swallowing food, liquid, and even pills.
Due to the concern over the confusion of the dose and the concern of possibly suppressing the patient's respiratory drive, the Fentanyl patch was dosed at 75 mcg an hour, and breakthrough pain was managed through intravenous Morphine given the patient's inability to take POs.
