**FINAL REPORT [**2108-6-21**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2108-6-21**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Pancreatitis: Presented with 3 days of abdominal pain in setting of heavy alcohol use, with elevated lipase to 1800 and CT scan confirming pancreatitis.
CT scan read here just relevant for acute pancreatitis with no evidence of pseudocysts or any clear necrosis.
When the patient had persistent leukocytosis, repeat CT imaging was performed and showed persistent necrosis but no organized fluid collection.
Since it may take additional time for her pain to recover, she was switched to a long acting morphine and this will be re-assessed in 2 weeks when she sees her GI doctor.
She was placed on a CIWA scale with no evidence of withdrawal.
Leukocytosis: U/A dirty, repeated U/A still with some WBC and prior UCx >100,000 EColi so have started treatment for umcomplicated UTI with Cipro for 3 days.
-WBC can also be due inflammation from pancreatitis  5.
COPD: Unclear if per PFTs, but has long smoking history.

After treatment with IVF and pain management you improved significatly but were still requiring very frequent pain medication so this was changed to a long acting medication, which will be re-evaluated by your GI doctor when you see him on the 25th.
