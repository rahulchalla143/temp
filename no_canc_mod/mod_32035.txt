On [**6-4**] his dyspnea got worse to the point where he could not even get out of bed and walk across the room without getting severely short of breath and light-headed, so he asked his son to take him to the hospital.
Initially, an EKG revealed atrial fibrillation with RVR in 170s so he was started on IV diltiazem.
His rate fell to 150s and rhythm switched to atrial flutter.
?cardiomegaly with right lung base airspace opacity compatible with atelectasis and/or infiltrates.??????
The OSH physicians felt the etiology was CHF secondary to afib, so he was started on a lasix drip.
Last time he had 4+ drinks was 4 years ago -Illicit drugs: None -Occupation: [**Country 3992**] War veteran (door gunner on a helicopter), now retired from construction -Religion: Catholic -Marital status: married -Home: [**Location (un) 4444**], MA   Family History: -Mother died of MI at age 72 -Has 12 brothers/sisters, many of whom have DM   Physical Exam: VS: T=98.1F  BP=114/69  HR=99, a-flutter   RR=17  O2 sat=89% GENERAL: well-appearing gentleman laying in bed.
NEURO: pearl, eomi CV: distance heart sounds irregular rhythm, tachycardic around 100, no murmurs, JVP 8 PULM: moderate expiratory wheezes bilaterally throughout lung fields ABD: bowel sounds present, non-tender, non-distended, voluntary guarding EXT: mild pitting edema in calves   Pertinent Results: Admission labs [**2198-6-6**] 05:33PM BLOOD WBC-9.4 RBC-4.67 Hgb-12.3* Hct-38.5* MCV-83 MCH-26.3* MCHC-31.8 RDW-13.6 Plt Ct-247 [**2198-6-6**] 05:33PM BLOOD Neuts-84.7* Lymphs-10.9* Monos-4.2 Eos-0 Baso-0.1 [**2198-6-6**] 05:33PM BLOOD Plt Ct-247 [**2198-6-6**] 05:33PM BLOOD PT-15.9* PTT-33.8 INR(PT)-1.4* [**2198-6-6**] 05:33PM BLOOD Glucose-162* UreaN-26* Creat-0.7 Na-135 K-5.2* Cl-95* HCO3-37* AnGap-8 [**2198-6-6**] 05:33PM BLOOD Albumin-3.6 Calcium-8.9 Phos-3.1 Mg-2.1 .
Generalized non-specific repolarization changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
TRANS-ESOPHAGEAL ECHO: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of atrial thrombus.
Bicuspid aortic valve with mild aortic regurgitation.
Mildly depressed left ventricular function.
Brief Hospital Course: 56yo man w hx of DMII, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, HTN who came in from OSH with suspected aflutter and hypoventilation now s/p tee and aflutter ablation, now in normal sinus rhythm.
Upon admission, EKG showed persistent atrial flutter with rates in the 150s.
On hospital day 2, the patient underwent TEE that showed no evidence of intracardiac clot, so we proceeded with ablation.
Pump: EF from OSH depressed likely [**2-19**] tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy.
Hypoventilation: likely [**2-19**] cardiomyopathy w increased pulm vascular congestion and with hx of tobb use/suspected COPD.
Recommend outpatient sleep study eval prn.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - atrial flutter s/p ablation - CHF, acute on chronic Secondary: - diabetes mellitus type II - suspected obstructive sleep apnea   Discharge Condition: stable on room air   Discharge Instructions: You came in with a fast heart rate called atrial flutter.
You underwent a procedure called TEE which confirmed there was no clot in your heart.
Then you underwent successful ablation of your atrial flutter.
Continue lisinopril, zetia, metformin at your home doses  Also, you were switched from Aspirin 325mg daily to low dose of Aspirin 81mg daily  Please have your coumadin level checked (INR) by your PCP on Tuesday and have your coumadin adjusted as needed.
If you have chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, leg edema please see your PCP or go to the emergency department.
