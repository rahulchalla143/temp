There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
On both echoes, there is a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion.
There is no clear-cut evidence of tamponade physiology on either echo.
Mitral valve and tricuspid valve inflows show variability which is partly due to atrial fibrillation.
[**2182-7-17**] CXR IMPRESSION: Small right pleural effusion with no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.

# LGI BLEED: GI bleeding resolved spontaneously.
We suspect that this was likely a diverticular bleed given his known diverticuli.
# C. dificile colitis Patient and family endorse months to years of intermitent mucousy output from his rectum and new in onset (for the past several weeks) incontinence.
The patient has stool studies sent in house for further work up of opportunistic infectious etiologies of these symptoms and c. diff came back positive.
This was considered an atypical presentation (vs. detection of an asymptomatic carrier) as the patient was not having diarrhea, leukocytosis or fevers.
Since the patient was having other symptoms, as above, that could be attributed to this, it was decided to treat c. diff with 2 weeks of metronidazole.
Flagyl course will be completed on [**2182-8-2**]  # Fecal incontinence: SYmptoms improved in the hospital, but not completely resolved.
# Pericardial Effusion:  Echo noted moderate pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
We suspect that this effusion is a sequelae of his valve surgery.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION with RVR: The etiology of the patient difficult to control AF was multifactorial related to LGIB, d/c of diltiazem and untreated c. difficile.
# VOLUME OVERLOAD with a h/o sCHF with recent EF 35-40%: Patient had elevated JVP and periperhal edema, suggestive of elevated R filling pressures.
The transplant team recommends that his cyclosporine levels be checked twice a week, in addition to his renal function.
#  Dysthymia:  Patient acknowledged stress of prolonged illness and sadness that has resulted from death of wife and son.

[**Location (un) **] Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with complaints of bloody diarrhea.
Your course in the hospital was complicated by poorly controlled atrial fibrillation and your were found to have an infection in your colon called Clostridium Dificile (C diff).
You were also found to have fluid around your heart (pericardial effusion).
Take flagyl for the C diff infection for two weeks.
COntinue metoprolol and diltiazem for your rapid heart rate.
