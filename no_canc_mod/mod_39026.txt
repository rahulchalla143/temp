Admission Date:  [**2131-12-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-1-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2065-10-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Atenolol / Ms Contin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath, chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 13621**] is a 66 year-old man with a history of COPD, AAA, and HTN, recently discharged on [**2131-12-3**] after being treated for pneumonia/COPD exacerbation with levofloxacin and prednisone.
He was also discharged on [**10-11**] after being intubated in the MICU for COPD exacerbation/pneumonia that eventually grew S. pneumonia and treated with levoflox.
The patient reports for the last four days he has been having worsening SOB, cough and sputum production.
The patient also developed sharp/pleuritic right lower chest and flank pain.
He states that the breathing and cough has worsened.
Pt denied hemoptysis, fevers, chills, abdominal pain or N/V.
He underwent CTA that showed RLL segmental PE with associated RLL infarct.
There was also a LLL consolidation concerning for pnuemonia.
Additionally, his AAA had increased in size to 4.2x7.5cm without evidence of rupture.
He was given Vancomycin/Levofloxacin for his pneumonia and started on a heparin gtt (guaiac negative).
On the floor the patient is complaining of SOB and pleuritic right sided chest/flank pain.
Pancreatic ductal dilation would recommend MRCP/ERCP.
Past Medical History: COPD, admission to [**Hospital1 2177**] with COPD exacerbation last winter.
AAA HTN Hyperlipidemia Gout Osteoporosis, history of L1 burst fracture on chronic opioids for pain relief, l3 compresion fracture   Social History: History of EtOH abuse with beer, no history of illicit drug use.
No history of clotting disorder.
Physical Exam: GEN: cachectic male, NAD, tachypneic and purse lip breathing, SKIN:No rashes or skin changes noted HEENT:10cm JVP, neck supple, No lymphadenopathy in cervical, posterior, or supraclavicular chains noted.
CHEST: diminished breath sounds with poor air movement, mild scattered expiratory wheezes CARDIAC: Regular rhythm; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
ABDOMEN: s/nt/nd EXTREMITIES: no pedal edema bilaterally NEUROLOGIC: Alert and appropriate.
No pronator drift.
Discharge Labs: WBC 11.5, HGB/HCT 9.9/31.2, PLT 280 PTT 45.1 (subtherapeutic and increased), INR 1.5 140 / 102 / 8 /  100 4.2 / 33 / 0.5\ Ca 8.4, Mg 1.8, Ph 2.5 Vanco Trough 27.2 Anemia labs [**2132-1-1**]: combined anemia from iron deficiency and chronic disease Vit B12 828 (nl) and Folate 7.1 (nl) Ferritin normal at 313 TIBC low at 163 Iron low at 12 .
Urine Culture [**2131-12-29**]:  ESCHERICHIA COLI.
IMAGING/STUDIES: CXR Portable [**2131-12-29**]: The lungs again are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and prominence of the interstitial markings with relative lucency of the upper lobes, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Scattered parenchymal scarring is again noted, most pronounced in the bilateral apical region, right greater than left, where biapical thickening is seen.
Mild opacities along the peripheral left lung base are without significant interval change to mildly decreased since the prior study.
Interstitial opacities are seen along the right lung base.
No discrete focal consolidation or pleural effusion is seen.
Partially visualized spinal metallic hardware is again noted.
Right lower lobe segmental pulmonary artery embolus with possible right lower lobe pulmonary infarct vs infection.
Focal consolidation in the left lower lobe concerning for infection.
Dilated common bile duct and prominent pancreatic duct.
Mild antral wall thickening and enhancement, may in part relate to underdistention or gastritis.
New hyperdensity within the aortic aneurysm which is likely calcification.
Bilateral Lower extremity U/S [**2131-12-30**]: Extensive thrombus within the left common and superficial femoral, popliteal and peroneal veins.
No right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Worsened bibasilar opacities are noted compared to [**2131-12-30**], worrisome for pneumonia.
Severe emphysema is noted.
Worsening bibasilar opacities compared to [**2131-12-30**], worrisome for pneumonia.
Mild dilatation of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct which taper normally at the ampulla and are smooth in contour.
This is most likely from papillary stenosis versus sphincter of Oddi dysfunction as no obstructing lesion is seen, however, a subtle lesion could be missed given limited evaluation secondary to patientinability to breath hold.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is partially thrombosed, and unchanged in appearance when compared to the recent CT, and better evaluated on that CT. 5.
Fibrosis at the right lung base with scarring involving the left lateral pleura as well as right hilar lymphadenopathy, findings unchanged from recent chest CT.  Brief Hospital Course: The patinet is a 66 year old man with severe COPD, AAA and HTN who presented with right-sided chest pain and worsening shortness of breath, and was found the have a pulmonary embolus and pneumonia.
PE: Pt found to have RLL segmental PE and likely infarct on CTA of the chest.
Also with left lower extremity DVT seen on ultrasound.
No indication of RV strain on ECG.
Over the course of his stay, patient reported less pleuritic chest pain and became less tachycardic.
Patient with no clear cause for thrombosis; denies family history, recent immobilization or travel.
Most likely inciting factor is malignancy given recent significant weight loss and multiple abnormalities seen on CT.
# PNA: Patient noted to have cough and leukocytosis as well as LLL consodiation on CT scan.
Shortness of breath improved somewhat with treatment.
Sputum culture was obtained, but showed only upper respiratory flora.
On the day of discharge, vancomycin trough was elevated at 27.
# Weight Loss: Pt with recent significant weight loss over the past few months, as well as multiple abnormalities on CT suggestive of possible malignancy.
MRCP obtained to evaluate for possible abdominal malignancy as a cause of pancreatic duct dilatation.
Results show similar findings to CT scan; moderate dilation of common bile duct and pancreatic duct, most likely due to papillary stenosis vs. Sphincter of Oddi dysfuncion, but no evidence of malignancy.
In addition, he will need a follow-up CT of chest to re-evaluate the LLL infiltrate, ensure resolution and no underlying malignancy.
Labs consistent with combined iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease.
# COPD: Patient with known COPD with multiple exacerbations associated with pneumonia.
He has had multiple hospitalizations and a recent intubation in [**2131-9-23**] for COPD exacerbation and pneumonia.
AAA: Pt with increase in AAA since [**2125**], but stable on this admission compared to recent ultrasound [**2131-12-18**].
CT scans were reviewed by vascular surgery, who felt there was no evidence of leak and no current indication for surgical intervention.
