Admission Date:  [**2159-6-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-7-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-12-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status, respiratory failure.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 68 yo M with h/o COPD and HTN who initially presented to the neurology service on [**6-20**] with AMS who is now being transferred to the MICU for HTN urgency and hypoxia.
An outpt head MRI/MRA revealed total stenosis of the [**Doctor First Name 3098**] but no ischemic infarcts.
He was then tx'd to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-20**] after presenting to an OSH with slurred speech.
Since being on the neurology service, he has had a EEG negative for szs, rpt MRI/MRA head without ischemia or temporal lobe enhancement, and LP that was significant for lymphocytic pleocytosis (WBC 85, 95% lymphs).
Past Medical History: COPD Dyslipidemia HTN Deaf in L ear   Social History: Married and lives with wife.
+ tobacco, no EtOH, no illicits.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: 96.5 166/92 80 26 90% on NRB --> 96% BIPAP 10/5 FiO2 ... GEN: elderly appearing man in NAD, awake, alert HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, OP slightly dry and without lesions, JVP approxmiately 13 cm above sternal notch NECK: Supple, no JVD CV: Reg rate, normal S1, S2.
CHEST: + accessory muscle use and abdominal breathing, improved from initial evaluation, + diffuse rhonchi ABD: Soft, NT, ND, no HSM EXT: No c/c/e SKIN: No rash   Pertinent Results: IMAGING:  [**2159-7-4**] Evoked Potentials: BRAIN STEM AUDITORY EVOKED POTENTIAL (08-044): After stimulation of either ear there were very poorly formed (and likely unreliable) evoked potential peaks including wave I and probably waves III and V, but the latencies were extremely difficult to determine.
[**2159-7-1**] EEG: Probably abnormal EEG with no clear overriding background rhythm seen largely because of superimposed beta activity which could be medication effect.
This tracing could be consistent with an encephalopathic process but further repeat study, as clinically indicated, would be of further diagnostic benefit.
There was no overt epileptiform or subclinical electrographic seizure activity seen.
[**2159-7-13**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a slow and disorganized background consistent with a moderate encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology.
Brief Hospital Course: OVERALL HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the MICU due to respiratory failure on the neurology floor from a combination of aspiration PNA and hypertensive urgency leading to flash pulmonary edema.
He had an extensive neurologic workup for causes of his encephalitis (labs, imaging, EEG, etc) and all of these results were negative.
His family brought up the possibility of an anti-NMDA receptor antibody mediated encephalitis as a possible cause, and CSF was sent to UPenn for special analysis; the Anti-NMDA Ab was negative.
<br> HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: <br> Altered Mental Status: Patient's mental status rapidly deteriorated in the MICU.
During the first 2 days, he followed commands, but became unresponsive thereafter.
Work-up was significant for lymphocytosis on CSF, two stable MRIs, 2 EEGs that showed no seizure activity, and evoked potentials that showed some brainstem activity.
A full panel of encephalitis and prion disease labs were sent.
Also, CSF was sent to UPenn for evaluation for anti-NMDA antibody encephalities and this was negative (testicular U/S performed for associated testicular malignancy in the setting of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was also negative and AFP which can be elevated in this setting was also negative).
Neuro also recommended against brain bx, as there was no focal lesion.
He was sedated on propofol and fentanyl and propofol was weaned several times to see if his mental status had changed but he did not exhibit signs of improvement.
Propofol was weaned on the day before he was extubated and he still did not show signs of improvement in mental status.
<br> Respiratory failure: Initially, patient's respiratory failure was thought to be due to a combination of aspiration PNA and flash pulmonary edema.
With diuresis and broad spectum coverage, his CXR improved and his leukocytosis and fevers resolved.
However, he was unweanable from the vent due to poor mental status, blood pressure lability, and heavy sedation requirements.
Pt has a hx of COPD, which was treated with standing albuterol and atrovent nebs and a steroid taper, with minimal signs of improvement.
Patient's sputum did grow out Klebsiella on [**7-6**] and he was initially treated with a course of vanc/cipro; cultures were pan-sensitive and vanc was D/C.
Because repeat sputum on [**7-10**] grew out GNR he was also started on cefipime, but the cultures only showed minimal growth of pan-sensitive Klebsiella and cefipime was D/C on [**7-13**].
<br> Blood pressure lability: Pt presented to the MICU with hypertensive urgency, which led to flash pulmonary edema.
Propofol was weaned several times to see if there was change in mental status, and most times it was weaned he became more hypertensive.
Tremors are caused by many of the viral encephilitidies and this was thought to be the most likely cause of his tremor.
<br> R upper extremity edema: Patient was noted to have swelling of R upper extremity greater than on the L on [**7-12**].
Patient had PICC on R arm and swelling was thought to possibly be [**2-3**] clot at PICC site.
Likely this was due to initiating steroids, as no source of infection was identified.
