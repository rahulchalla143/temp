atrial fibrillation ?
on Coumadin, and asthma who is s/p unwitnessed fall and was transferred from an OSH for SAH and SDH.
Head CT showed SAH in the right frontal lobe, small 2 mm thick SDH overlying the left frontal lobe and along the tentorium, and a nondisplaced occipital skull fracture.
CT C-spine showed a nondisplaced left occipital skull fracture with overlying soft tissue swelling and small SDH along tentorium, no cervical spine fracture.
Past Medical History: CAD Atrial fibrillation Asthma  Social History: Unknown  Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: VS: temp 98.6, bp 150/69, HR 88, RR 25, SaO2 95% on RA Genl: Awake, eyes open spontaneously, confused HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, no conjunctival injection, oropharynx clear Neck: C-collar in place CV: Irregularly irregular heart rate, Nl S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Chest: CTA bilaterally, no wheezes, rhonchi, rales Abd: Hyperactive BS, soft, NTND abdomen .
Sensation: Withdraws bilateral lower extremities to noxious.
No ankle clonus.
Head CT [**2156-2-14**]: Expected evolution of intracranial hemorrhage including bifrontal subdural hematoma, subarachnoid, and parenchymal hemorrhage.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Acute pulmonary emboli in segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries of the right lower lobe and lingula with no signs of right ventricular strain.
Incidental left upper lobe nodule noted on recent CT of the upper extremity containing a large amount of fat, likely a benign hamartoma.
Signs of small airway disease.
Scattered peribronchial ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe, could be inflammatory or infectious, should be correlated with clinical information.
Mildly dilated esophagus, likely presbyesophagus.
Mild cardiomegaly and right atrium enlargement.
Bilateral small pleural effusions with dependent atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 yoF w/ a h/o unwitnessed fall c/b SAH/SDH, non surgically managed, transferred to medicine from neursurgery service when incidentally found to have pulmonary emboli, received an IVC filter after repeat CT head was found to have an increase in SDH.
# NSurg Course: The patient had an unwitnessed fall and a SDH, she initally was intubated and her coagulopathy related to coumadin use was reversed (INR initially was only 1.8, now 1.2).
She also had an occiptal fracture which was non displaced.
She was admitted to the ICU for close neuro observation she underwent a follow up CT which was unchanged for presence of blood and unchanged occipital fracture.
She was extubated on her first hospital day and was noted to have a low sodium she was fluid restricted for 24 hours which elevated the NA to 133.
She complained of left shoulder pain and xray showed no fx however was found to have incidental finding on CT UE of 1cmx.08 nodule which was found to benign on Chest CT.
However upon Chest CT she was found to have bilat segmental and subsegmental PEs.
Her neurologic exam remained stable and a repeat CT on [**2157-2-14**] showed stable intracranial hemorrhage with expected evolution of blood products.
# Subsegmental PEs: Seen incidentally after CT of shoulder (done due to pain) demonstrated a lung abnormality, which prompted a CT of chest demonstrating PE's.
No hypoxia or hemodynamic instability.
She should be monitored for neurologic signs and symptoms for worsening head bleed.
# Urinary tract infection: Pt.
has some suprapubic pain, Urine Cx grew out E.coli and enterococcus which were both sensitive to Nitrofurantoin.
# Rash: The patient developed a maculopapular rash on her abdomen and left arm on [**2157-2-13**].
The Dilantin was stopped and her rash improved.
She was started on Famotidine 20mg PO BID and Sarna lotion for symptomatic relief.
# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was continued on Lopressor which was changed to Toprol XL 75mg PO qday for better compliance.
Her blood pressure target is <160 systolic due to her head bleed.
She should continued to be monitored for hyponatremia.
# Delirium: baseline dementia with superimposed delerium, likely secondary to toxic metabolic reasons including UTI and hyponatremia as well as SDH and PEs.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for Topical fungal infection.
