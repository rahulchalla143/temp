Name:  [**Known lastname 4276**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]                      Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 4277**]  Admission Date:  [**2129-11-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2129-11-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2055-5-22**]       Sex:  M  Service:  ADDENDUM  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Medicine service accepted this 74 year old male who presents with worsening renal insufficiency from the CCU team.
History of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, status post open reduction and internal fixation of the left hip at an outside hospital on [**9-17**].
History of hepatitis C. Status post below the knee amputation on the left, secondary to peripheral vascular disease with atrial fibrillation, controlled now in normal sinus rhythm.
He presents with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus growing in his blood cultures and urine.
Last blood culture positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was [**10-28**]; all others have remained negative.
[**10-15**] films show no osteomyelitis.
Lumbar puncture was done and was negative for the source of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A Transesophageal echocardiogram was performed on [**10-31**] which showed no endocarditis.
There was no scleral icterus.
There was no jugular venous distention noted.
Extremities:  Notable for a left below the knee amputation.
Range of motion on the left is limited secondary to pain since his open reduction and internal fixation in [**Month (only) 4278**].
All blood cultures had remained negative since [**10-28**] which was positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Cardiovascular:  Atrial fibrillation was controlled throughout this admission for this period of time on Amiodarone 200 mg q. day.
The patient had a known left atrial appendage thrombus and was maintained on heparin until all interventions were performed.
Infectious disease:  The patient had no identifiable source of his Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.
Several studies were performed to further evaluate cause of the Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection and his leukocytosis, initially presenting with a white blood cell count of 21.
He had some synergistic dosing which was discontinued after four days time.
A bone scan was performed which demonstrated increased uptake in the left proximal femur and acetabulum, consistent with osseous repair following fracture and surgical repair and infected component could not be excluded from the proximal left femur based on the bone scan findings.
They said they could not rule out a Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus seeding of the hardware based on this bone scan.
They suggest a six week course of Vancomycin with a follow-up bone scan at that time to further evaluate the surgical repair versus hardware seeding of this patient's Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
CT also demonstrated diffusely atrophic pancreas with multiple small cystic structures, measuring several mm in the head of the pancreas.
No obvious masses were seen.
Findings probably represent ITMT or changes in chronic pancreatitis.
The interventional radiologist did not feel that the psoas muscle abscess versus hematoma was drainable.
They suggested antibiotic regimen and follow-up with a rescan to assess the progression of the hematoma versus the abscess in four to six weeks.
End stage renal disease.
Initially, a temporary line was placed until the patient was cleared of infection and white count had returned to [**Location 1867**].
The patient had no difficulties tolerating the dialysis procedure.
The patient was evaluated by psychiatry for this change in mental status who suggested an adjustment disorder with depressed mood and suggested dosing Remeron to increase appetite and sleeping q h.s.
Diabetes:  The patient was maintained on 15 units of NPH at breakfast, 4 units of NPH at bedtime as well as six units of regular insulin at dinner, on top of a regular insulin sliding scale as well as a diabetic diet.
The patient had a noticeable pressure ulcer over his coccyx, for which he was treated with appropriate wound care.
Gastrointestinal: The patient had electrolytes repletion prn as well as Loperamide occasionally prn for diarrhea.
The patient had a baseline hematocrit resting at 29 to 30.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation, now in sinus on Amiodarone.
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his urine.
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his blood.
Diabetes mellitus.
Hepatitis C. Adjustment disorder with depressive symptoms and dementia not otherwise specified.
