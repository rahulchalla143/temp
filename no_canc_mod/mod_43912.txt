Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 67y/o M with a complex PMH including DM type 2, [**Hospital3 9642**] mechanical AVR ([**2168**]), Ascending aorta repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**] with subsequent explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**], with recent broad spectrum antibiotic courses Pseudomonal UTI [**6-2**] and R foot infection [**7-2**] now presenting with suprapubic pain, low grade fever, leukocytosis and hypotension.
# SIRS - WBC elevated to 19 on admission.
He had multiple potential sources of infection including UTI, R foot ulcer s/p debridement and BSI.
No evidence of PNA on CXR and cough at patient's baseline on admission.
Also considered C. diff given multiple recent broad spectrum courses of antimicrobials, but negative x 2.
The patient is at high risk for resistant GP and GN organsisms given history.
He did grow out Pseudomonas from urine, for which he was treated with meropenem x 14 day course given resistance in the past.
He does not have chronic indwelling foley.
No evidence of cardiac event or additional source of leukocytosis.
With previous history of VRE and MRSA did initially receive daptomycin/vancomycin pending further culture data, as GNR more likely source, but d/c'ed on [**8-22**] and [**8-23**] respectively after blood cultures negative.
No evidence of abdominal/pelvic source of infection.
No evidence of osteo on Xray and vascular commented that wound does not look acutely infected.
There was also concern over possible graft or AV valve infection.
Patient has been afebrile since [**2178-8-24**].
Pt became hypotensive and bradycardic while on the commode on [**2178-8-30**] requiring atropine, pressors (dopamine) and pt was also intubated.
His WBC count was found to be elevated at 26 but pt was afebrile.
Initially there was concern that pt had SIRS or sepsis, however, WBC count resolved w/in 12 hours.
Pt was pan-cultured, no cultures positive to date since the urine culture gotten on admission.
It was felt that the hypotension was likely vasovagal.
# Hypotension - BP dropped to systolic 80s in ED, was responsive to IVF boluses and also was on levophed in MICU.
Also considered source of bleeding given elevated INR, but guaiac negative in ED and Hct's stable.
CT abdomen, pelvis showed No RP bleed, no acute process.
On [**2178-8-18**] had flash pulmonary edema with acute drop in sats, tachycardia, HTN, diaphoresis, new crackles on exam with new bilateral pleural effusions on CXR.
Pt became hypotensive and bradycardic while on the commode on [**2178-8-30**] requiring atropine, transfer to MICU, pressors (dopamine) and intubation [**1-26**] ventilatory failure.
His WBC count was found to be elevated at 26 but pt was afebrile.
Initially there was concern that pt had SIRS or sepsis, however, WBC count resolved w/in 12 hours.
Pt was pan-cultured, no cultures positive to date since the urine culture gotten on admission.
It was felt that the hypotension was likely vasovagal and c/b fluid resuscitation which then caused pulmonary edema.
Because he had flash pulmonary edema on multiple occasions and was occasionally bradycardic in the setting of hypotension, cardiology was consulted for further advice on managing his tenous volume status and for ?
Because of his difficult volume status he was transferred from the ICU to the cardiology service rather than to the regular floor team for further management.
After about 24 hours on the cardiology service, the patient developed hypertension and SOB, found to be tachypneic and tachycardic c ventilatory failure on ABG and was intubated.
After Cr bumped after several days of aggressive diuresis, patient was switched to torsemide as monotherapy for diuresis.
It was felt that the patient's recurrent flash sx might have been [**1-26**] ischemia from known CAD (s/p CABG with intact LIMA, occluded vein grafts per last cath).
LHC showed known blockages with no targets for intervention.
Renal angiogram showed no evidence of stenosis.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure - During flash edema episdodes, pt w/ pulmonary edema, poor oxygen sats.
Was on BiPAP, but with persistent hypoxia despite diuresis.
Etiology intially thought to be cardiogenic from decompensated heart failure.
CT torso on [**8-22**] showed ground glass opacity with consolidation, suggestive of infection, edema, or ARDS.
CXR's improved with diuresis, so most likely source was pulmonary edema.
Over the course of his admission, the patient had three episodes of hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation; all resolved with aggressive diuresis and the patient was able to be extubated.
# Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 25-30% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD explantation.
# s/p Mechanical AVR - on coumadin, INR supratherapeutic on admission, and patient with high sensitivity to coumadin doses (?
if secondary to antibiotics).
Has be subtherapeutic since [**2178-8-24**] (goal is 2.5-3.5).
# Acute Renal Failure - Likely secondary to diuresis vs. poor perfusion vs. hypotension vs. UTI.
# ?C diff - multiple loose bowel movements on [**2178-9-1**].
# DM type 2 - continue home lantus and insulin SS.
Patient had elevated CBGs during hospitalization initially that were controlled after uptitrating sliding scale to provide aggressive mealtime coverage.
# Dyslipidemia - continue statin.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Miralax 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) dose PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: urosepsis, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, right-sided foot ulcer status post multiple surgical debridements Secondary Diagnoses: 1. coronary artery disease status post bypass 2. history of ventricular fibrillation 3. history of pacemaker placement with subsequent infection and lead removal 4. aortic valve replacement 5. history of ascending aorta repair 6. hypertension 7. hyperlipidemia 8. diabetes mellitus, type 2, complicated by neuropathy 9. peripheral vascular disease, complicated by left sided below knee amputation 10. hepatitis C 11. hypothyroidism 12. history of opiate and benzodiazepine dependence 13. chronic subdural hematoma   Discharge Condition: Fair, with no shortness of breath or chest pain.
Lungs are clear to auscultation with trace dependent edema.
Discharge Instructions: You were originally seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for suprapubic pain and fever.
You were found to have a severe urinary tract infection and were treated with IV antibiotics.
Your hospital course was complicated by numerous occurrences of rapid fluid collection in the lungs causing difficulty breathing and requiring intubation three separate times.
We felt that this was likely due to your severe congestive heart failure.
We aggressively treated you with diuretics to take off this excess fluid and improve your breathing.
We felt that you would benefit from cardiac catherization to see if there were any blockages that could be precipitating your episodes of pulmonary edema.
You received cardiac catherization which showed no new blockages that could be intervened on; therefore, the plan was to continue you on medical management.
The following medications were changed during your hospitalization: DISCONTINUED furosemide DISCONTINUED metolazone ADDED torsemide (instead of the two above medications) for removal of excess fluid DISCONTINUED metoprolol for now as your blood pressure and heart rate may not tolerate it DISCONTINUED spironolactone for now as your blood pressure may not tolerate it INCREASED gabapentin to 600 three times a day for better control of your neuropathic pain ADDED docusate for constipation ADDED senna for constipation ADDED bisacodyl for constipation ADDED miralax as needed for constipation ADDED lorazepam as needed for anxiety.
During your next appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], your cardiologist, you will need to discuss restarting metoprolol, and/or spironolactone, as those medications are good for people with heart failure.
