**FINAL REPORT [**2117-8-29**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2117-8-29**]):    No MRSA isolated.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
The small retrosternal air collection documented on a CT from [**8-28**] is, with knowledge of this CT, visible on the lateral chest film.
Minimal left apical atelectasis.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
Main pulmonary artery is free of filling defects and there is no heart strain or pulmonary infarct.
2.Subcutaneous emphysema along the left axilla and chest wall as well as trace pneumomediastinum likely from recent chest tube removal or placement.
Brief Hospital Course: 27 year old female with a pmh of poorly controlled asthma and frequent flares who presents s/p PEA arrest secondary to status asthmaticus +/- bilateral PTX.
# Respiratory distress: She presented from an OSH with bilateral chest tubes after needle decompression.
Chest tubes d/ced by IP yesterday, some concern for small residual PTX on the right but recent CXR demonstrate no concerning PTX at this time.
- History of asthma requiring 2 previous trips to the ED for treatment.
Lately, patient did say that there has been a construction site near her house and she has noticed her asthma worsening, using her inhalers during past week.
- Patient also had bilateral subsegmental PE in RUL, RLL, LUL, L lingula demonstrated by CTA.
Both of these processes could likely have caused her presentation and it is unclear if her PE could have set off an acute asthma exerbation or if her PE is subclinical.
Currently, she is at RA, satting well and feeling well.
# PEA arrest: 8 minutes of resuscitation, likely secondary to hypoxia from status asthmaticus but PE could have contributed to this picture as well.
There is a possibility that the clot was bigger at one point and perhaps after 8 min of CPR, clot was dislodged and traveled more distally.
-see above for workup and tx for asthma/PE.
Family also concerned that patient's anxiety at home could trigger asthma attacks.
# Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to acute inflammatory process and steroids.
Patient was very adamant about quitting after leaving hospital and understands that smoking increases her risk of future asthma attacks as well as a hypercoag state that could lead to another PE.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: asthma exacerbation Bilateral pulmonary emboli   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath and was urgently rescusitated and intubated.
You were admitted for an acute asthma excerbation, which likely precipitated this event.
We also found that you had sub-segmental pulmonary emboli in your lungs, on both sides.
This means that you had small clots that traveled in the arteries that supply your lungs.
It is unclear if this pulmonary emboli event contributed to your asthma exacerbation or whether this triggered you to have shortness of breath and loss of pulse independently.
We would like for you to follow up with a pulmonologist as an outpatient visit to assess your risk for future clots and exacerbations.
As for your severe asthma attack, we have started you on oral steroids, prednisone, which you will need to continue taking on a tapered regimen.
