However, on the final read there is now mention of a possible soft tissue density just inferior to the left hilum and posterior to the heart.
It is read as possibly being focal atelectasis given the presence of a painful effusion; however, the final read notes that a small mass, such as a lung cancer, in this location cannot be excluded.
It recommends a serial computerized axial tomography after the pleural effusion is resolved or possibly a positron emission tomography scan.
Also mentioned is a tiny nonspecific lesion in the liver which is felt most likely to be a cyst or hemangioma as opposed to any type of malignancy.
This same small atelectatic lesion was also seen on prior chest x-ray as a retrocardiac density.
This atelectasis versus mass could be followed up with a repeat chest x-ray or computed tomography in the future.
