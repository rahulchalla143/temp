HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 72-year-old male, who was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital from [**2-21**] to [**2142-4-6**] for acute mesenteric ischemia for which he had status post aortobifemoral bypass graft for an occluded mesenteric vasculature with dead bowel.
His previous hospital course was complicated by anastomotic ulcer with significant bleeding.
The bleeding had subsequently subsided over a period of time.
He also had leukocytosis, and on initial CT scan, there was presumed small bowel obstruction at the small bowel - colon anastomosis.
Acute mesenteric ischemia.
Aortobifemoral/superior mesenteric artery bypass graft.
Left subclavian double lumen Hickman.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
CT of the abdomen and CT angiogram:  Small bowel obstruction with distention of the small bowel, edema of the small bowel wall, most likely at the ileocolonic anastomotic site.
A small bowel resection with jejunocolostomy was also performed, and a diagnosis of bile peritonitis was confirmed in the OR.
He had an estimated blood loss of 2 liters in the OR.
They felt that he demonstrated no evidence of acute ischemia during his present hospital course.
Patient was also started on TPN with the help of a nutritional consult.
On [**4-16**], the patient was started on diuresis of his fluid overload.
On [**4-17**], a right upper extremity ultrasound was obtained for right upper extremity swelling.
This ultrasound demonstrated a nonocclusive thrombus of the right internal jugular vein.
On [**4-19**], the patient developed diarrhea, Clostridium difficile was sent, which returned negative.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable, and remained afebrile throughout the rest of his hospital course.
Small bowel obstruction status post small bowel resection.
Cholecystitis status post cholecystectomy.
Patient is also to be followed up for video swallowing test to assess for his aspiration potential within 2-3 weeks.
