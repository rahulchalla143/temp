CXR: FINDINGS: In the interim, there is essentially no change in the position of the right atrial lead which still terminates in the right atrium.
There is slight worsening of a small left pleural effusion.
Heart is mildly enlarged.
Slight increase in the small left pleural effusion.
[**2202-3-31**] CXR: Preliminary Report REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of pacemaker lead placement.
There is a slight increase in the left currently moderate pleural effusion.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
The lungs are hyperinflated with no new consolidations demonstrated.
Severe kyphoscoliosis is again noted, unchanged, as well as chronic left apical fibrotic changes most likely related to previous granulomatous exposure.

She went to device clinic and was found to have a resolution of her symptoms with an increase of her pacer rate.
She was sent to the hospital for atrial lead repositioning / replacement.
While inpatient her pacer was interrogated and there was a clear reproduction of symptoms with rates that were slower (in the 30s) and a resolution of the symptoms with faster rates.
She underwent an EP study, they were unable to reposition the lead so she had the atrial lead replaced which was then functioning well.
