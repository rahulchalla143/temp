**FINAL REPORT [**2161-6-15**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2161-6-15**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
He went to interventional radiology for bleeding pelvic fracture.
On HD 2 because of the increasing hemothorax and the fact that he recieved 15 units of PRBCs, 15 units of FFP, 2 units of platelets and 1 unit of Cryoprecipate and Amicar drip it was decided to put in a posterior chest tube.
HD 3 he was in Atrial fibrillation so he was started on a diltiazem drip.
HD 4 he went to the OR with Ortho for left upper extremity washout.
He will need to have that left radial fracture immobilized for a total of 6 weeks.
Also while he was in the OR his pelvic fracture was stressed.
He is touch down weight bearing on the left for a left acetabular fracture.
On HD 9 he spiked a fever and he started to develop a left pleural effusion.
Micro showed a E.coli urinary tract infection and a bronchoalveolar lavage showed Klebsiella and Morganella.
He had a calorie count started.
