At that time she and some of her close friends noticed a change in her voice.
A few weeks after this was noticed, the patient fell on her face and her speech became worse.
It was suspected that she sustained a small stroke and she began speech therapy.
She noted a longstanding problem with balance and was seen in neurology clinic where she was initial thought to have significant cervical spine disease causing myelopathy and sensory loss.
A Head CT and CT of the c-spine where without evidence of major abnormalities.
Over the month of [**Month (only) **], the patient noted an intermittent cough on thin liquids and over several weeks this developed into a very strong gag reflex and difficulty swallowing.
Concern was raised for ALS and an outpatient EMG was arranged which showed an extensive sensorimotor polyneuropathy.
The patient was again seen in neurology and at this point her exam had changed significantly with worsening muscle weakness, evidence of fasculations and prominent speech alteration.
In the meantime, the patient reports increasing instability.
She denies lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.
Denied difficulties comprehending speech or parasthesiae.
She has chronic urinary incontinence and wears pads.
She denies bowel incontinence or retention.
She denies any noticeable muscle cramps or uncontrolled movements.
On general review of systems, the patient denied recent fever or chills.
She endorses recent weight loss secondary to inability to tolerate solid foods.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
She did have a left breast lump 2-3 months ago which was felt to be a hematoma from a fall and this has resolved.
She reports frequent bouts of cellulitis but denies recent rashs, skin lesions.

At presentation her clinical exam was notable for marked bifacial weakness, atrophic tongue with fasciculations, motor weakness ([**5-14**]) in upper extremities and lower extremities ([**4-13**]), hyperreflexia and marked dysarthria.
This raised concern for a mixed upper and lower motor neuron process most consistent with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or a related disorder.
She eventually had a repeat EMG during the hospitalization that showed a generalized disorder of motor neurons or their axons.
Compared to the previous  study on [**2164-11-13**], in addition to the widespread fasciculations seen before, there was now diffuse moderate-to-severe active denervation in all muscles tested except the genioglossus.
There is no electrophysiologic evidence for a disorder of postsynaptic neuromuscular transmission, as would be seen in myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
On [**12-5**], Ms. [**Known lastname 95472**] had a acute respiratory decompensation where she became tachypneic to the 30's and had marked difficulty saying more than [**2-11**] syllables before needing to take a breath.
Her vital capacity at that time was found to be 590cc and her NIF was -22.
She transferred back to the floor on [**12-6**] and remained stable from a respiratory standpoint.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 95472**] you were admitted to the neurology service for further evaluation of your worsening lower extremity weakness, difficulty swallowing and speech difficulties.
Your clinical exam was highly suspicious for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a EMG confirmed the diagnosis.
