Admission Date:  [**2141-11-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-11-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2059-12-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**] Chief Complaint: stridor, ?
airway issues with tracheostomy here for bronchoscopy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**11-9**]: flexible bronchoscopy [**11-10**]: re cannulation of tracheostomy and capping  [**2141-11-16**]:  Excessive mucus plugs and secretions in the T-tube with subglottic proximal mucosalswelling and edema.
Exchange tracheostomy   History of Present Illness: 81-year-old woman with history of Parkinson's disease S/P a mechanical fall few months ago with C2-C4 fracture S/P spinal fusion/hardware placement.
She underwent a tracheostomy tube secondary to concern for unstable cervical spine.
Patient underwent flex bronch today in the OR under deep sedation (No rigid bronch was performed due to concern about spinal instablility) showed  small/ moderate granulation tissue/ridge in proximal trachea ant wall with severe cervical malacia proximal to the trach tube with complete dynamic collapse.
Patient is being admitted for pre-op eval by neurosurgical service for spinal stability for neck hyperextension during rigid bronchoscopy.
Past Medical History: Laryngeal swelling, respiratory failure Parkinson's Disease Mechanical Fall: C2-C4 Fracture s/p fusion Cervical Spine [**5-7**] Tracheostomy prophylaxis [**5-7**] History of Pneumonia  Social History: Permanent resident at [**Hospital **] rehab  Family History: Noncontributory.
Physical Exam: T 99.3  BP 152/84  HR 65 RR 23  O2 Sat 99% on 3 L. GENERAL:  The patient is an elderly female, in no significant respiratory distress.
CHEST:  She has coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
FINAL REPORT [**2141-11-17**] MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2141-11-17**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Hiatal hernia is large.
Lungs are otherwise clear with no focal area of significant atelectasis.
[**11-10**] CXR: There is a very large hiatal hernia which occupies the mid section of the chest.
There is large left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms and a moderate left pleural effusion.
There is also focal right lower lobe consolidation.
AP CHEST [**11-14**] Severe bibasilar consolidation which developed between [**11-2**] and [**11-10**] has worsened on the right since [**11-12**], stable on the left since [**11-10**] though associated moderate left pleural effusion is slightly smaller today than on [**11-14**].
Esophagus is distended above a large gastric hiatus hernia.
No pneumothorax.
[**Name8 (MD) **] MD was immediately aware and entered the room to notice her cyanotic and minimally responsive.
At this time, her pulses were weak and she was notably hypoxic and without spontaneous respirations.
Her ABG was notable for mild respiratory acidosis consistent with respiratory failure.
She responded well to positive pressure ventilation and was brought to the MICU for further intensive monitoring.
MICU course: This is an 81 y/o woman with PMH notable for Parkinson's disease and C2-4 fracture s/p fusion with tracheostomy due to recurrent pneumonia admitted to MICU after PEA arrest on the floor.
Likely related to mucous plugging but patient reportedly had dinner so could be related to aspiration.
Per notes from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab was eating a soft diet there with thin liquids.
Do not feel that there is evidence of new pneumonia at this time (no WBC elevation, no fever); will continue to monitor for signs/symptoms of infection.
d/w IP team pt to go to floor - continue albuterol/atrovent nebs with mucomyst nebs - further trach interventions (i.e., rigid bronch) per IP team -CXR tomorrow to eval change in LLL opacity ??????
persistent LLL opacity, c/w atelectasis, PA and lateral may be better to assess -blood gas this AM [**11-11**] to better assess pulmonary status in presence of increased CO2 .
# s/p PEA arrest: Likely related to hypoxia secondary to the above.
Telemetry monitoring during time of event appears to have artifact (versus VT but out of sync on 2 leads so this is unlikely) followed by bradycardia.
Artifact could represent chest compressions and no other telemetry strips printed from time of event.
# Osteoporosis: Continue calcium and vitamin D. .
# Parkinson's disease: Continue sinemet, mirtazapine, modafinil and entacapone (the last two ordered non-formulary) .
There were some proximal narrowing points found on her bronchoscopy, so the patient was left uncapped with a PM valve intermittently.
She then subsequently was admitted to the SICU on [**11-14**] for increased secretions and was discharged to the floor on [**11-15**] after aggressive suctioning.
Throughout the rest of her stay, she continued uncapped with intermittent PM valve utilization for speaking, and was noted to have some minor breath stacking when her PM was placed for long periods.
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection TID (3 times a day) as needed for DVT prophylaxis.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Acetylcysteine 20 % (200 mg/mL) Solution Sig: One (1) ML Miscellaneous [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for secretions.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for bronchospasm.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Laryngeal swelling, respiratory failure Parkinson's Disease Mechanical Fall: 1months C2-C4 Fracture s/p fusion Cervical Spine [**5-7**] Tracheostomy prophylaxis [**5-7**]   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You should call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 80052**] or Dr.[**Name (NI) 14680**] office if you are having trouble with your tracheostomy tube or if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills, productive cough, blood in sputum or any other symptoms that concern you.
