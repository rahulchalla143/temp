There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis and inferoseptal hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with prior inferior infarction.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with borderline systolic function.
The right ventricle was probably mildly hypokinetic/dilated on the prior study also.
