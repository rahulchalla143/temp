Admission Date:  [**2161-7-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2161-8-2**]   Service:  [**Location (un) **]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncope  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, myocardial infarction in [**2157**], chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, who presents after falling in the bathroom earlier on the day of admission.
The patient had a sensation of shortness of breath and lightheadedness around the time of the event.
The patient has no history of seizures.
The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection, consistent with his symptoms of dysuria and increased frequency of urination.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to be febrile, with decreased oxygen saturation, and tachycardic with ST depression, mostly rate-related, and most obvious in Leads V4 through V6.
At that time, he had a pseudomonas/enterococcus urosepsis, that presumably led to demand ischemia and subsequent myocardial infarction.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was started on ceftazidime for pseudomonal coverage, based on his past episode of urosepsis.
The patient was also given one unit of packed red blood cells for demand-related ischemia.
About two hours into the patient's transfusion, he had an episode of tachycardia to 120, an increased respiratory rate up to 40, with a temperature of 100.6.
He was found to be very wheezy and also had distinct rigors.
His chest x-ray showed no evidence of any flash pulmonary edema.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2157**] 2.
Hypertension 3.
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine is 1.4 to 1.6 6.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 8.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy 9.
History of urosepsis  MEDICATIONS: 1.
Iron sulfate 325 mg by mouth three times a day  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, mucous membranes moist.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention, normal carotid upstroke.
A very large scrotal hernia.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Urinalysis showed leukocyte esterase moderate, white blood cell count 21-50, no squamous epithelial cells.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of consolidation or congestive heart failure.
A few hour later, the electrocardiogram showed a rate of 80, with [**Street Address(2) 8206**] depressions in V4 through V6, and 1-2 mm depressions in I, II, III, AVF.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is an 85-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2157**], chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, who presents with demand ischemia and significant ST depressions in the lateral leads secondary to developing urosepsis.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient initially had a low CK and troponin.
It was concluded that the patient had a non-Q wave myocardial infarction in the lateral/inferior leads.
It was thought that this myocardial infarction was secondary to demand ischemia because of the patient's urosepsis and associated tachycardia.
His blood pressure medications were initially held secondary to hypotension.
It was thought that the patient's myocardial infarction was very unlikely secondary to a thrombotic event, but this nevertheless could not be ruled out.
Atrial fibrillation:  Two days into the patient's admission, he developed spontaneous paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, with rates as high as 140s to 150s.
He also had three separate episodes of [**10-17**] beat ventricular tachycardia.
During the patient's atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia episodes, he was totally asymptomatic.
Given the patient's new onset atrial fibrillation and hypotension, he was transferred under the care of Coronary Care Unit.
The patient went back and forth between atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm.
The patient converted from atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm with one 200 joule shock.
He was given a loading dose with intravenous, and then started on 400 mg by mouth three times a day.
The patient was also continued on his heparin, now for anticoagulation secondary to atrial fibrillation.
Pump:  The patient was initially hypotensive on admission secondary to his urosepsis.
The patient developed acute episode of wheezing, which may represent a symptom of volume overload for this patient.
The patient also became volume overloaded during his hypotensive episodes while in atrial fibrillation.
He also had 1+ aortic regurgitation, 3+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
The patient was also noted to have mild left ventricular dilatation, anterior, anteroseptal, apical, inferior hypokinesis and akinesis.
This did not represent a significant change from his echocardiogram in [**2157**], although the degree of pulmonary artery hypertension had increased.
Blood pressure:  The patient's pressure was initially low secondary to his urosepsis.
It was also at its trough during his episode of atrial fibrillation.
Urine culture grew out proteus PCs.
The patient stayed relatively afebrile through his admission, spiking only to a high of 100.6.
It went up to a high of 2.5, likely secondary to the patient's numerous episodes of hypotension.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient's increase in liver function tests was most likely secondary to the amiodarone, which was discontinued.
However, a right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained, which showed widening of the inferior vena cava, and echogenic liver changes consistent with cardiac cirrhosis or fatty changes in the liver.
The patient also initially had poor oral intake and nausea secondary to amiodarone.
The patient remained guaiac negative.
Ambien 5 mg by mouth daily at bedtime as needed for insomnia 10.
Simethicone 40 to 80 mg by mouth four times a day as needed for indigestion 12.
Atrovent nebulizers, one nebulizer every four hours as needed for wheezing 15.
Non-Q wave myocardial infarction 3.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 4.
Chronic renal insufficiency 6.
Anemia                                 [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 8207**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8208**], M.D.
