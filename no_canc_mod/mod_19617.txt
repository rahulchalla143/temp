This pregnancy was notable for an ultrasound showing an absent stomach bubble consistent with esophageal atresia and also cerebral left frontal ventriculomegaly stable at 11 mm since mid trimester.
Following this she developed a fever and was admitted for observation and discharged home.
At delivery vacuum assistance was required for extraction.
There was no other evidence of chorioamnionitis or sepsis risk factors.
There was intrapartum antibiotic mitral valve prolapse prophylaxis.
Rupture of membrane occurred at delivery and yielded copious blood tinged fluid.
The infant emerged apneic and hypotonic at delivery with copious oral secretions, well maintained heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute.
Subsequently she was pink and in no distress on room air.
Head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat: Mild frontal bossing.
No nasal flaring.
Chest: No retractions, no grunting.
No adventitious sounds.
Left upper quadrant mass distinct from the liver is noted,  consistent with splenomegaly.
A chest x-ray showed esophageal     atresia, likely isolated without fistula in light of an     absent stomach bubble and gasless abdomen on initial x-     ray.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.
Gastrointestinal: As previously mentioned there is high     suspicion for a tracheal esophageal fistula with     esophageal atresia.
Suspected esophageal atresia with tracheal esophageal     fistula.
