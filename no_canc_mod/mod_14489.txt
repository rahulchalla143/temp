Pregnancy was complicated by the finding of a left sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia by ultrasound, reaffirmed by fetal magnetic resonance imaging.
Stomach and intestines were seen in the left chest and the liver was thought to be below the diaphragm.
Fetal echocardiogram revealed a mildly small left ventricle but with normal orientation and good function as well as a small muscular ventricular septal defect.
Aortic arch appeared mildly hypoplastic but was not well visualized and antegrade flow was seen.
No other fetal anomalies were detected.
He emerged with moderate tone and weak respiratory effort.
He was rapidly intubated with 3.5 cuffed endotracheal tube and then resuscitated with stimulation and positive pressure ventilation with gradually improving tone and respiratory effort and color.
The infant was brought to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit with positive pressure ventilation.
General - The infant was well developed, nondysmorphic infant, active with examination.
Chest - Minimal breath sounds on the left, coarse breath sounds on the right with positive pressure ventilation.
Cardiac is regular rate and rhythm with no murmur audible, no gallops present.
Abdomen - mildly scaphoid, three vessel cord present, no masses, bowel sounds present.
Extremities - Hips and back normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The infant was placed on assist control ventilation but was difficult to ventilate and oxygenate secondary to agitation.
Initial settings of 20/4 were increased to 24/4 secondary to work of breathing and a chest x-ray revealing low lung volumes.
In addition, the x-ray confirmed the diagnosis of a large left congenital diaphragmatic hernia with small residual left lung.
Initial blood gas revealed respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.12 and pCO2 of 90.
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
