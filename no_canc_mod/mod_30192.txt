Admission Date:  [**2135-9-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2135-9-23**]   Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old female with a known history of aortic stenosis who presented to the hospital on [**2135-9-11**] with increasing shortness of breath.
The patient had aortic regurgitation recent hospital admission in [**2135-6-24**] for syncope at which time she was noted to have AV block leading to permanent pacemaker placement.
She was discharged from the hospital without sequelae and was doing well at home until the day prior to admission when she had mild epigastric discomfort, orthopnea and shortness of breath with minimal exertion.
Aortic stenosis.
The patient had an echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] of this year which revealed severe aortic stenosis with aortic valve are of 0.8 and left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%.
She also underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2135-7-7**] which revealed an LAD lesion of 80%.
Hypertension 3.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 6.
Hypercholesterolemia 7.
Chronic anemia 8.
Atrial fibrillation/flutter on amiodarone and Coumadin preoperatively  ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.
Eyedrops for glaucoma 6.
Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: GENERAL:  The patient is a pleasant female who is acutely short of breath.
CORONARY:  Regular rate and rhythm with a grade 2/6 systolic murmur.
PULMONARY:  She has bibasilar crackles with wheezes.
She was maintained on the medicine service where she was being treated for presumed pneumonia with levofloxacin.
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab on [**2135-9-15**] where she was found to have critical aortic stenosis and markedly depressed cardiac output and one vessel coronary artery disease.
She was asymptomatic from these abnormal thyroid function studies.
On postoperative day #1, the patient remained fully paced on intravenous amiodarone, apparently to suppress her history of atrial fibrillation which was her baseline rhythm as well.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION TODAY: NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and oriented in no apparent distress.
CARDIAC:  She has an audible S1, S2 with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
PULMONARY:  The patient does have bibasilar crackles, but is otherwise clear to auscultation.
EXTREMITIES:  Peripherally, the patient has minimal edema in her feet bilaterally.
The patient had received some captopril postoperatively, but there was a question of a possible history of renal artery stenosis which is not possible to ascertain definitively at this time.
Aortic stenosis, status post aortic valve replacement 2.
Hypertension 3.

Hypercholesterolemia  Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] is being discharged today to rehabilitation facility to increase her strength and mobility.
