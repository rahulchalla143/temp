HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, sarcoidosis, and a left bundle-branch block who was brought to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department after being found down at the gymnasium where he had been exercising on a treadmill.
Transcutaneous pacing was attempted as well, unsuccessfully.
STAT laboratories disclosed a potassium elevated at 6.6, and the patient was given calcium gluconate, bicarbonate, and insulin.
He also denied orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and palpitations.
He did report occasional shortness of breath with exertion.
A left bundle-branch block.
An echocardiogram in [**2175-5-6**] disclosed an ejection fraction of 40% with no wall motion abnormalities.
A stress test in [**2175-5-6**] disclosed regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but no reversible defects.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus times 10 years.
Cardiac catheterization revealed there was moderate left and mild right ventricular diastolic function, there was mild focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction, there was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension, there was a left-sided superior vena cava.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Father with diabetes mellitus.
The patient initially to be in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Difficult to assess jugular venous distention due to body habitus.
Heart examination revealed bradycardia in the 40s.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The lungs revealed bibasilar crackles.
Left first toe with hyperkeratosis on the plantar surface.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema.
Electrocardiogram revealed a heart rate in the 40s, a junctional rhythm versus atrial fibrillation, with low rate.
A left bundle-branch block (old).
IMPRESSION:  This is a 57-year-old male with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sarcoidosis, and hypercholesterolemia status post a syncopal episode with a heart rate initially in the 20s and an electrocardiogram consistent with probable junctional rhythm.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out an ischemic event, and they peaked with a creatine kinase of 348.
Mapping disclosed dysfunction of the patient's sinus node.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities included anteroseptal hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets appeared structurally normal with good leaflet excursion, and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened, and trivial mitral regurgitation was seen.
There was no pericardial effusion.
Sinus node dysfunction with apparent junctional rhythm.
Old left bundle-branch block.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
