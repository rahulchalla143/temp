Right lower extremity pain, swelling: The patient was admitted and treated for extensive lower extremety cellulitis.
The history of lower extremity swelling and new onset liver disease (see below) raised red flags for schistosomiasis given its endemicity in [**Country 3399**].
Schistosomal antibodies were however negative.
No infectious organism responsible for the cellulitis was convincingly found, with wounds growing only [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**] thought to be a contaminant and treated for several days with IV micafungin.
All blood cx to date have been negative, CXR clear, and dopplers of lower extremity were negative for DVT.
Ultimately patient defervesced and respiratory status improved wth diuresis and large volume paracentesis of ascites fluid (see below).

HCV Cirrhosis: CT from OSH showed ascites, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and portal hypertension.
Diagnostic paracentesis in ED was consistent with transudative ascites fluid, no SBP.
Initially AST, AP, and t bili slightly elevated, but trended down.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed no thromboses.
Schistosoma antibodies were negative.
Hepatology consulted and attributed new cirrhosis to HCV.

Disp:*1 box* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: - Right lower leg cellulitis - Hepatitis C cirrhosis - Refractory ascites - Grade II esophageal varices - Duodenal ulcer w/ bleeding - H.pylori - CKD stage IV   Discharge Condition: Stable for home  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with swelling in your right leg and an infection of the skin of the right leg.
During your hospitalization, we also found that your liver was injured, probably because of infection by hepatitis C.  It's unclear how you got hepatitis C, but it is very prevalent in [**Country 3399**].
You will need to follow up with a gastroenterology to discuss treatment of your hepatitis C as an outpatient.
Given your liver disease, please do not take more than 2gm of tylenol per day.
It's likely that these ulcers formed because of an infection by a bacterium called H. pylori.
