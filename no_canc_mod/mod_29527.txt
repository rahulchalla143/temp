Interval development of moderate-sized retroperitoneal hematoma, likely due to the patient's coagulopathy.
Interval development of mild-to-moderate left-sided hydronephrosis, which may be due to hemorrhage within the proximal ureter, or related to inflammation/stranding within the retroperitoneum from underlying hemorrhage.
A followup CT or MRI examination is recommended after resolution of the hematoma to exclude an underlying lesion.
Unchanged mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy dating back to [**2170**], of unclear etiology.
Stable mild calcification involving the gallbladder wall.
CT head no C No acute intracranial process.
Probable chronic opacification involving the right maxillary and ethmoid air cells.
Minimal left suprabasal atelectasis.
Otherwise, unremarkable, no evidence of pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief the patient presented with echymoses in his hands and noted to have elevated INR.
A CT scan was positive for retroperitoneal hematoma.
The etiology of the patient's elevated INR is umclear.
The trigering event for the hematoma might have been the minor fall that the patient experienced.
Fever: the patient developed intermittent fever throughout the stay.
A CXR was positive only for atelectasis and a repeat CT was read as a resolving RP hematoma without acute changes.
The fever was felt to be secondary to the hematoma and no antibiotics were indicated.

Discharge Disposition: Home with Service  Discharge Diagnosis: Supratherapeutic INR/coagulopathy Retroperitoneal bleed Acute blood loss anemia  Secondary: Schitzophrenia Atrial fibrilation Kleinfelter's disease   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because your dosing of blood thinning medication was high.
Although not exactly clear why this happened we believe that it may be due to the decreased oral intake and diarrhea that you experienced prior to the admission.
We did a scan of your abdomen and noted that you had some bleeding which has been stable over the last several days.
