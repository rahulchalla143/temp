The baby emerged with poor respiratory effort and was given bag mask ventilation with a good response.
The infant had initial respiratory distress and was sent to the NICU for further evaluation.
On arrival to the NICU, the patient looked younger than 38 weeks, closer to 35 to 36 weeks by examination with examination notable for mild inspiratory crackles, occasional grunts, no murmur and normal tone.
The baby was assessed to have mild respiratory distress secondary to either transitioning or infection.
RESPIRATORY:  Shortly after arrival, the patient developed worsening distress and was intubated.
An x-ray was consistent with pneumonia versus surfactant deficiency.
Ampicillin and gentamicin were initiated given concerns for significant respiratory distress and potential pneumonia found radiographically.
Respiratory distress syndrome, resolved.
