Admission Date:  [**2144-11-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2144-11-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2084-12-7**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 59-year-old female with history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction with stent to right coronary artery four years ago presenting with chest pain to [**Hospital3 3834**] [**Hospital3 **].
Patient reports that her pain lasted about 45 minutes and was a pressure radiating to both arms.
No nausea or vomiting.
No diaphoresis.
No shortness of breath.
Patient had ST elevations inferiorly.
Patient was then medflighted to [**Hospital6 256**] for emergent catheterization due to persistent chest pain and ST elevation.
Cardiac catheterization findings were 50% mid left anterior descending stenosis, proximal right coronary artery occlusion, increased right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute, ST elevation in II, greater than 4 mm, III greater than 8 mm and aVF greater than 6 mm with reciprocal changes in the lateral leads and ST depression in V2.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2139-9-4**] times one, status post angioplasty.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No jugular venous distention.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  This is a 59-year-old female with history of myocardial infarction and right coronary artery stent now with acute inferior posterior myocardial infarction.
Cardiovascular:  Patient with history of right coronary artery occlusion with stent, now 50% mid left anterior descending lesion with proximal right coronary artery occlusion.
Cardiac catheterization at this hospital showed focal basal right ventricular wall hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 40-45%.
Patient had rescue PCI of the right coronary artery.
Plavix was initially given for management since patient had a history of anaphylactic reaction to aspirin.
Intraaortic balloon pump was given for increasing coronary perfusion and was weaned after dopamine therapy.
The patient initially had a run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on telemetry and was started on lidocaine infusion.
Patient had a repeat echocardiogram which showed ejection fraction of 40% with focal hypokinesis of the right ventricular free wall inferior lateral left ventricular, as well as trivial myocardial infarction.
Patient had intraaortic balloon pump pulled with no complications and gradually had beta-blocker titrated up and had no further telemetry events throughout the rest of her hospital course.
Sputum was sent off for Gram stain, which was positive for gram positive cocci in clusters and gram negative rods.
Patient was initially started on vancomycin and levofloxacin and never developed a significant white blood cell count elevation.
Patient was extubated and had no complications.
Infectious Disease:  Patient spiked several fevers while on the ventilator.
Overall, after initial intraaortic balloon pump placement and a ventilator management, patient was able to be weaned without complications and aside from a course complicated by a fever spike and initiation of antibiotic therapy.
Patient, overall, did well and was able to saturate well on room air and had no further telemetry events towards the end of the hospital course.
Inferior posterior myocardial infarction.
Coronary artery disease.
This medication should be continued for life as patient is allergic to aspirin.
