History of Present Illness: This [**Age over 90 **] year old lady was found at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab to have an episode of vomiting of undigested food followed by 5 episodes coffee ground emesis in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR on Warfarin for PE and plavix for CAD.
At that time per ED Call in, she denied chest pain, dyspnea or abdominal pain.
She has resided at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU [**2124-12-6**]-since [**2124-12-30**], Floor [**2124-12-31**]-Present after a Rt ankle fracture from [**Hospital3 **] hospital.
The patient was found to be in rapid Afib (rate 130s) with a non-tender abdomen and guaiac negative; unsuccessful NG lavage.
She was given NS and 1 unit FFP and Vitamin K 10mg IV x1 for elevated INR.
Given an elevated WBC count, cough, CXR appearance and infected appearing U/A, the patient was started on Vanc/Zosyn and admitted to the ICU.
She has a cough but is unsure of its duration and is unsure if she has had fevers.
She recalls that she was nauseated and vomiting last night and was nauseous earlier today but is without nausea or abdominal pain at this time.
She denies any bleeding and bloody stools.
She denies chest pain and reports that her breathing is "bad as usual."
Her daughter confirms that the patient did not receive a stent at [**Hospital3 **], her diagnosis of PE was uncertain.

Hematemesis: The patient was admitted after 4-5 episodes of coffee grounds emesis without hemodynamic instability, on Aspirin, Plavix and Warfarin for a recent NSTEMI and ?
GI Consulted, no EGD necessary.
1 unit pRBCs transfused although the patient only experienced a drop in hematocrit consistent with fluid hydration.
Patient without stent or hardware, so also has presumed history of pulmonary embolism, no clear indication for plavix even in setting s/p NSTEMI.
Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate: The patient was admitted with a sustained rate of 120s-130s in atrial fibrillation and a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
She spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm with fluid and blood rescuscitation with a period of transient hypotension that resolved.
Several days into her course patient spontaneously converted back into atrial fibrillation with rapid rate, accompanied by worsening dyspnea and pulmonary edema.
Given CHADS 1 and recent GI bleed (as well as h/o recurrent falls), the decision was made not to anticoagulate, coumadin is discontinued.
# Pulmonary edema: In the setting of afib with RVR, patient develoepd pulmonary edema.
She was diuresed gently with 10 mg IV lasix boluses and was approximately 2 L net negative over the next 24 hours with improvement in dyspnea and oxygenation.
If she becomes SOB again, we strongly recommend considering fluid overload with potential treatment with low-dose lasix (as well as consideration of aspiration).
Leukocytosis with bacteruria: The patient had a rapidly rising WBC with Left shift but no bands, positive U/A (recent Enterobacter infection) and ?
Given persistence of WBC prior to leaving the ICU, repeat cultures were sent, and CXR showed worsening infiltrates.
Hypoxia/COPD: The patient has an O2 requirement that was initially likely secondary to COPD and/or pneumonia (see above).
CAD/Recent NSTEMI: Patient was on ASA, Plavix and metoprolol after recent NSTEMI, no percutaneous intervention or hardware present.
Troponin elevated here, but with normal CK/CK-MB, and the troponin remained flat.
With impaired GFR and recent NSTEMI this may represent old MI, renal failure or MI within the last 7 days.
EKG was not revealing of ST changes.
Decided to discontinue plavix in setting of GI bleed and risk > benefit.
Dysphagia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event.
Concern for aspiration continues.
PE: The patient has an uncertain history of PE based on elevated PA pressure from [**Hospital3 5097**], no confirmatory test performed per HebReb records and daughter.
The patient is due for cast removal, but must have an Aircast Ankle brace to replace it until ~ [**2125-1-16**].
# Had femoral line originally in setting of GI bleed, then removed.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - [**Location (un) 550**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hematemesis Atrial fibrillation with [**Hospital 5509**] Hospital-acquired pneumonia Dysphagia Pulmonary edema   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with vomiting blood.
You had some fluid on your lungs, and diuresis with low-dose lasix improved your respiratory status.
You were on medications for a presumed pulmonary embolism (plavix and aspirin) but we feel that given you had a bleed, your risk of bleed outweighs the benefits, and so we are discharging you solely on aspirin, and not on plavix anymore.
You were on coumadin for atrial fibrillation and for a presumed pulmonary embolism, but given your history of falls and your gastrointestinal bleed on this admission, it is felt that the risk of bleed outweighs the benefit of stroke prevention, and so we have discontinued your coumadin.
You were found to be aspirating, so your diet was changed per speech & swallow recommendations.
