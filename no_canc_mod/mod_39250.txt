diastolic, last EF 70%), history of MVR, recent recurrent PNAs, and severe COPD, who presents with shortness of breath.
Two days prior to admission the patient reported worsening breathing and increased sputum production, although she was having a hard times coughing it up.
She was slightly more hypoxic, increased O2 requirement from 2-4L.
In the ED, the patient reported chest pain only with cough.
Her EKG showed rapid Afib, no other changes.
She had poor airflow and decreased breath sounds at bases.
Over course of ED, she developed worsening respiratory distress with tachypnea and lots of accessory muscle use.
Her CXR showed RLL pneumonia very similar to previous CXR.
She was given diltiazem 10mg IV x1 for afib with RVR, and HR improved to 90s.

Right Pleural Fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CTA chest [**2103-1-17**]: Although this study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, images of the upper abdomen demonstrate reflux of contrast into the intrahepatic IVC and hepatic veins, and an apparent filling defect in the intrahepatic IVC.
Nonadditional abnormalities are identified.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Filling defect within the intrahepatic IVC, which is incompletely imaged but could represent mixing artifact.
However, further evaluation with ultrasound of the intrahepatic IVC is recommended to exclude clot.
Possible left lower lobe pneumonia.
Stable large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion.
CT head without contrast [**2103-1-17**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
[**2103-1-17**] Gallbladder/liver U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of filling defect within the intrahepatic IVC.
[**2103-1-18**] MR head w/o contrast IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarction.
Moderate microangiopathic small-vessel disease.
A possible left atrial thrombus vs mass is seen (best visualized in parasternal views) which measures 1.4 x 0.8 and appears to adhere to the wall of the left atrium.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity.
A mitral annuloplasty ring is seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-12-5**], the left atrial mass appears new.
This focused study did not [**Year (4 digits) 4656**] valvular structure and function or ventricular function.
[**2103-1-17**] MRI head There is no evidence of hemorrhage or areas of slow diffusion to suggest acute infarction.
Bilateral scattered foci of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities with confluent signal changes in the periventricular white matter extending into the brainstem consistent with moderate microangiopathic small vessel disease.
A punctate focus of FLAIR and T2 prolongation is demonstrated in the right thalamus, suggesting an old lacunar infarct.
There is no mass or mass effect.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarction.
Moderate microangiopathic small-vessel disease.
[**2103-1-17**] Liver U/S No evidence of filling defect within the intrahepatic IVC .
CXR ([**2103-1-26**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-23**], there has been substantial decrease in the right pleural effusion.
Severe chronic pulmonary disease persists with coarse interstitial markings.
No definite acute focal pneumonia is appreciated.
diastolic, last EF 70%), history of MVR, recent recurrent PNAs and severe COPD presented with shortness of breath.
She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and CTA chest was negative for PE but showed a question of a LLL PNA and sputum grew MSSA.
Thoracentesis in the intensive care unit yielded serosanguinous fluid 850cc which was concerning for malignancy, cytology was negative.
# SOB/COPD - As above, her SOB on presentation was severe enough to require intubation.
Regarding the etiology of her sympotms, much of her shortness of breath is likely due to her severe and chronic COPD as well as significant pulmonary hypertension.
Her acute worsening on admission was likely due to her pleural effusion with possible contribution of a MSSA pneumonia.
Her pleural effusion was drained for 800 cc in the intensive care unit and her breathing did improve.
She was also treated with 7-days of vancomycin and 5-days of levofloxacin for possible pneumonia though it is not clear if this was a definite contributor in this case.
Her shortness of breath continued to trouble her and her pleural effusion re-accumulated.
We decided to put her on prednisone given her continued symptoms for a planned slow taper.
For her pleural effusion, it was drained again on [**2103-1-25**] by interventional pulmonology for about 650 cc.
Both times the fluid was consistent with a transudative exudate.
The etiology of her effusions is not clear.
- prednisone 40 mg daily, plan for slow taper with decrease by 10 mg qweek down to 10 mg daily.
# Left atrial thrombus - A CTA was done on admission that was negative for a pulmonary embolism but did show a question of a left atrial thrombus versus mass.
A TEE was attempted while she was intubated but the cardiologists were unable to pass the probe secondary to a very small esophagus.
A TTE was then performed but this was unable to distinguish between an atrial thrombus and an atrial mass.
They felt that given the fact that Ms. [**Known lastname 17926**] had an echocardiogram 1-month ago that was negative for this clot/mass, that it was most consistent with a clot and not a mass.
# Atrial fibrillation w/rvr - The patient's heart rate was only poorly controlled with her home regimen.
was noted to have anisocoria on day after admission which appeared to be new, she was evaluated by neurology and MRI head was negative for acute infarction.
Her anisocoria is most likely [**1-3**] a horner's syndrome [**1-3**] trauma from intubation.
# DM - Her finger sticks were initially well controlled on sliding scale insulin.
# chronic diastolic CHF - She was given several doses of IV lasix to aid with diuresis and her home lasix was increased to 60 mg daily.
# Malnutrition - as above, megace was discontinued given the atrial thrombus.
