Admission Date:  [**2199-8-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-8-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-2-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: nausea, vomitting, poor po intake x2-3 days  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bone marrow biopsy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG, hypercholesterolemia, depression, GERD who presents with 2 days of nausea and vomiting.
He had been in his usual state of health when he began to feel "bad", developed nausea and non-bilious, non-bloody emesis.
He reported some right sided sharp chest pain during episodes of emesis as well as some LUQ pain with emesis as well.
He had no chest pain aside from that which he experienced with wretching.
He has no dysuria and no change in urinary frequency.
He often does not have much of an appetite and will often not eat anything after breakfast.
He denies any history of alcohol withdrawal seizures or symptoms of any kind.
Labs were remarkable for ARF (Cr 1.4), bicarb 8, lactate 2.8, and anion gap of 34.
Breathalyzer negative for alcohol.
CT Abd/Pelvis was negative for acute infection.
On arrival to floor he denied chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, fevers, chills, lightheadedness or weakness.
Coronary artery disease.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Hypertension 4.
Depression 5.
Chronic anemia with pancytopenia 7.
History of allergic rhinitis.
No history of EtOH withdrawal.
Neck: No JVD, supple CV: Regular rhythm, nl s1 s2, no m/r/g appreciated Chest: Mild wheezing.
No rebound or guarding.
CT abd [**8-4**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions and stable parenchymal calcifications which may reflect amiodarone usage.
Nodular liver reflecting underlying cirrhosis.
CXR [**8-4**]: Small right pleural effusion.
No evidence of congestive heart failure.
No focal infiltrates.
There is a small right pleural effusion.
There is no left pleural effusion.
Old rib fractures of several right ribs are unchanged compared to [**2196-12-27**].
1) Acidosis: The patient was found to have an anion gap metabolic acidosis with pH 7.28 in ED.
Delta delta is 22, so corrected bicarb is 30 - some component of metabolic alkalosis possibly from vomiting.
Differential diagnosis for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes DM, alcohol, starvation - all of which are typically seen with ketones as in this patient.
Lactic acidosis (also mildly present here) caused by circulatory/respiratory failure, sepsis, ischemic bowel, sz, liver failure - patient is hemodynamically stable so makes these unlikely.
Likely a component of starvation ketosis/ alcoholic ketosis and lactic acidosis in setting of dehydration and renal failure.
Etiology was felt most likely [**12-28**] starvation ketosis (acute on chronic), with possibility of some component of ingestion.
The patient was treated with CIWA scale for withdrawal symptoms (did not require any benzos), IV thiamine, and folic acid.
Coags unremarkable, albumin c/w poor nutritional status.
He admitted to drinking more than he should, but was not interested in AA or other programs.
3) Nausea/Vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomitting quickly improved after admission, and may have been due to viral gastroenteritis or acidosis.
He was given PO Zofran, which helped a lot, and he was eating well without nausea or vomitting prior to discharge.
4) Cardiac: * Ischemia: CAD s/p CABG: Chest pain with wretching.
On further interview, symptoms suggestive of GERD (typically occur with pepsi, [**Location (un) 2452**] juice, right side chest burning, never elicited by exertion).
He was continued on a PPI for GERD symptoms, and his chest pain resolved.
Multiple polymorphic PVCs.
5) Acute renal failure: The patient's ARF was likely related to dehydration, and quickly improved with rehydration (Cr 1.4-->0.9).
In [**Hospital1 34374**] records, the patient has had episodes of pancytopenia in past, thought to be [**12-28**] chronic alcohol use.
8) Asthma: The patient had mild wheezing on exam.
A CXR showed only a small effusion.
