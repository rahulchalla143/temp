Admission Date: [**2120-10-29**]        Discharge Date: [**2120-11-6**]   Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female patient, with hospitalization earlier this year for congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema and palpitations.
She has also had several hospitalizations in the past 4-5 years for congestive heart failure.
The patient has been followed by echocardiograms for her mitral regurgitation, and most recent echo from [**Month (only) **] of this year revealed 4 plus mitral regurgitation with mitral annular calcification, as well as a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 percent.
The patient subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed two-vessel coronary artery disease, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65 percent, and severe pulmonary hypertension.
The patient was referred for mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft, as well as a Maze procedure for atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
Status post umbilical hernia repair.
Status post breast biopsy.
Status post right ankle cyst removal.
ALLERGIES:  Keflex which causes nausea and vomiting.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2120-10-29**], where she was taken directly to the operating room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 2 with a LIMA to the LAD and a saphenous vein to the OM.
She also had a metabolic acidosis which was treated with sodium bicarbonate.
On postoperative day 2 had begun with diuresis, still remained somewhat hypotensive on IV Neo-Synephrine drip.
Her pulmonary artery catheter was discontinued, as were her epicardial wires and chest tubes.
The patient was started on Coumadin on postoperative day 3 for her history of atrial fibrillation, status post Maze procedure.
She had progressed well from a hemodynamic and respiratory standpoint, although was slow to progress with physical mobility and ambulation.
The patient had remained in normal sinus rhythm, or being paced by her permanent pacemaker,  tracking her native atrial rate, until [**11-5**] when she was noted to be in atrial fibrillation early in the morning with a rate between 100 and 120.
She has had intermittent atrial fibrillation this morning with ventricular response rate in the 80s-90s.
Her Steri-Strips to her sternal incision were clean, dry and intact, as was her right lower extremity incision.
She had some edema of her right lower extremity and some peripheral edema remained bilaterally only when her legs are in a dependent position, but she was continuing to be diuresed.
