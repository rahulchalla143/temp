Admission Date:  [**2138-11-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-12-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-3-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Increasing O2 requiremen  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 23372**] is a 51 year old male with history of recent trauma resulting in C3-C5 cord contusion and quadraplegia who presents with increasing O2 requirement at rehab.
Prior to the admission, the patient was reportedly driving with onset of chest pain, SOB, and abdominal pain.
He suffered multiple injuries including C3-C5 spinal cord contusion, teardrop fx at C3, injury to ALL, multiple L periprosthesis femur fx, R [**4-3**] anterolateral rib fractures, and grade II liver lac.
The patient was hypotensive and bradycardic upon admission, consistent with neurogenic shock.
Although a CT angiogram of the chest was negative for PE at the time of admission (pt was 2 weeks postop from a Lt distal femur fracture repair and suspicion of pulmonary embolism as mechanism of presenting chest pain, SOB was highly suspected at time of presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]), a CXR on [**11-4**] showed evidence of PE/infarction of the Lt lower lobe.
He was unable to be extubated due to easy fatigue and so received trach/PEG on [**11-6**].
No sources of infection were found: sputum, BAL, urine, blood, indwelling catheters, pressure ulcers, sinus infections, wound infections, etc.
His Rt common femoral DVT was to be the only possible source of his intermittent fevers.
Despite high dose coumadin (20mg daily) he remained subtherapeutic and was discharged on lovenox and coumadin pending therapeutic INR.
He was afebrile for several days prior to discharge.
This morning he was noted to desat at rehab with increased O2 requirements from FiO2 30--> 50%.
He reports shortness of breath and subjective fevers.
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions, however the ED was concerned about possible patchy infiltrates.
No signs of volume overload.
Poor urine output.
No history of EtOH.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
white tongue s/p mouth care.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
LUNGS: diffusely coarse breath sounds, good air movement biaterally, no wheeze or crackles.
2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
SKIN: L thigh incision extending from hip to below knee with staples in place and minimal surrounding erythema, no fluctuance or drainage NEURO: A&Ox3.
IMAGING: ADMISSION CXR: Acute moderate pulmonary edema with bibasilar compressive atelectasis.
Findings consistent with multifocal infection, accompanied by small pleural effusions.
Nondisplaced rib fractures and C7 nondisplaced spinous process fracture.
Mild splenomegaly.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Resolving hemoperitoneum with no evidence of visceral injury.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Interval evolution of the cord contusion extending from C3-C5 into cystic myelomalacia.
Stable severe spinal canal stenosis from C3-4 through C4-5 and moderate spinal canal stenosis at C5-6.
Probable tarlov or synovial cyst abutting the left L4-5 facet joint.
Bilateral pleural effusions and secretions in the trachea.
DISCHARGE CXR: Previous mild pulmonary edema has nearly cleared.
Dense consolidation persists at the base of the left lung and could be atelectasis or pneumonia accompanied by persistent small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
DISCHARGE LABS: WBC-4.0 RBC-3.31* Hgb-9.3* Hct-28.3* MCV-86 MCH-28.2 MCHC-32.9 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-177 Neuts-55.2 Lymphs-36.6 Monos-6.5 Eos-1.3 Baso-0.4 ALT-28 AST-31 LD(LDH)-259* AlkPhos-116 TotBili-0.4   Brief Hospital Course: 51 year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever.
# Leukocytosis/Fever: #.
Fevers: patient had persistent fevers up to 104.
Though he had a leukocytosis on admission (to 11), this resolved and the fevers persisted.
His only localizing symptom was hypoxia with subjective difficulty breathing, and a CXR was consistent with volume overload vs possible multifocal infiltrates/pneumonia.
Blood and urine cultures were no growth, urine legionella antigen and influenza DFA were negative.
His Picc line was removed out of concern for a possible line infection, and the tip sent for culture (also no growth to date).
Follow-up CXR showed improvement, and patient was not demonstrating signs of respiratory infection.
Other studies including MRI of C, L, T spine, CT ab/pelvis, viral studies including HIV and multiple blood, urine, stool and sputum cx were all negative.
ID was consulted and felt that fevers were most likely non-infectious, as patient had not shown any evidence of infection and did not develop tachycardia or other hemodynamic signs of infection despite high fever.
Patient will f/u with ID and should have full FUO workup (malignancy, rheumatologic) if still spiking fevers at that time.
# Hypoxia: Increased O2 requirement associated with fever and leukocytosis is concerning for pneumonia.
CXR was read as moderate pulmonary edema and interval worsening of his bilateral pleural effusions, but could also possibly be consistent with multifocal infiltrates.
Respiratory status and oxygenation improved, however patient could not be successfully weaned from the vent due to muscle weakness and anxiety.
# s/p L femur ORIF: Ortho [**Doctor First Name **] saw patient and wound not did look infected.
# Bipolar disorder: Patient has longstanding history of psych issues.
He appears to have a question of bipolar disorder in the past, but more likely has depression.
