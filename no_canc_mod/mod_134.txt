# HHS: Glucose elevated to 1053 on admission with anion gap 25, hemoconcentrated to Hct 54.
Glucose on u/a but no ketones.
Although this picture could also be consistent with b-hydroxybutyrate ketoacidosis, the high glucose and type II diabetes history makes HHS more likely.
AG could also be secondary lactate elevation from poor perfusion in the setting of volume depletion.
Urinalysis demonstrates 9 WBC and few bacteria (along with 3 epidermal cells).
Ischemic cardiac event was ruled out with troponins x 4.
We held her oral diabetes medication while inpatient.
# UTI: Admission urinalysis concerning for possible UTI, but culture more likely contamination.
Urinalysis demonstrated 9 WBC and few bacteria (along with 3 epidermal cells).
Urine culture with 10-100K gram positive cocci concerning for lactobacillus vs. group a strep.
Lisinopril and furosemide were held as patient initially demonstrated pre-renal azotemia with initial creatinine to 1.3 which responded to 0.9 with IVF.
# afib: Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] was rate controlled while in house with atenolol.
Her lisinopril and furosemide were stopped in the setting of her acute illness.
Please start these as you see fit if her blood pressures become elevated as her systolic blood pressure have been in the 110's prior to discharge here and thus we didn't start them.
