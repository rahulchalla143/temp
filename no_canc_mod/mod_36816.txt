HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of polycystic kidney disease who has been on hemodialysis for the last 15 years who was initially admitted [**11-17**] for a splenic laceration several weeks post motor vehicle accident.
The patient presented to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**11-17**], complained of abdominal pain in his left upper and lower quadrant.
CT of his abdomen at the time disclosed free fluid in the pelvis in the left paracolic gutter and question of heterogeneous splenic mass concerning for rupture.
In the PACU, he was extubated but required intubation due to obtundation and inability to protect his airway.
The patient developed further bleeding and was returned to the Operating Room for re-exploration, hematocrit of 21.
The patient was noticed to have 2500 cc of blood loss with the surgery and postoperative he was noted to have no flow to his right AV fistula graft.
The patient remained intubated secondary to volume overload.
The patient also developed a temperature to 102??????
The patient in the SICU was also found to have sinus tachycardia with a negative CTA and electrocardiogram demonstrating T-wave inversions in 1, L, V2 through V6.
The patient developed an enzyme leak which was consistent with acute myocardial infarction.
The patient was finally stabilized and was extubated on [**11-22**] and required intermittent Bi-PAP and was difficult to wean from respiratory support.
The patient was initially transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit team for further management of his respiratory failure on [**2187-11-27**].
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the first time, the patient was found to have paralysis of his right hemidiaphragm due to phrenic nerve dysfunction.
The patient had been transferred to the floor and was doing well, however on the day of [**12-11**], the patient was found acutely unresponsive, had a chest x-ray consistent with a new aspiration event.
Arterial blood gases showed improvement in the patient's PCO2 to 43 and patient was back to his baseline mental status.
After intubation, the patient became tachycardic with pulse in the 150s.
ECG was suggestive of atrial flutter versus narrow complex supraventricular tachycardia.
The patient did have ST depressions anteriorly.
The patient received shock x2 with no change in rhythm.
The patient received 6 mg of adenosine also with no effect.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Patient's past medical history is remarkable for polycystic kidney disease.
The patient has end stage renal disease on hemodialysis since [**2171**].
The patient has a history of bacterial endocarditis in [**2175**], status post mitral valve replacement and debridement of perivalvular abscess.
The patient has a history of hypertension, history of peptic ulcer disease, history of lower gastrointestinal bleed, history of embolic cerebrovascular accident.
The patient is status post parathyroidectomy, history of gout, history of hypothyroidism, history of a left inguinal hernia that has been repaired in the past.
Magnesium sulfate  ALLERGIES:  The patient is not known to have any drug allergies.
CARDIAC:  Notable for tachycardic, but regular.
No murmurs were appreciated.
PULMONARY:  The patient was noted to have coarse breath sounds that were equal bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Nondistended with a midline scar.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
IMAGING:  Chest x-ray at the time of admission showed that he had a left IJ and an ETT in the proper position.
In short, this a 49-year-old male initially admitted for splenectomy with a complicated hospital course including postoperative bleed and multiple hypercarbic arrests who presented again to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2187-12-11**] after hypercarbic respiratory arrest and subsequent hemodynamic collapse.
Pulmonary - respiratory failure:  The patient's respiratory failure is presumed to be due to a combination of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis, narcosis and multiple aspiration events.
Additionally, the patient's volume status was tenuous and frequently felt to be contributing to his inability to wean from mechanical ventilation.
This is notable for bilateral pleural effusions as well as consolidation at both lung bases concerning for infection.
The patient underwent diagnostic therapeutic tap of his pleural effusion on [**2187-12-14**] with 800 cc of exudative fluid removed.
The patient was re-extubated on [**2187-12-16**] and initially did well, however he required re-intubation for PEA arrest on [**2187-12-17**].
However, given that the patient had already undergone two hypercarbic respiratory arrests after extubation while in the hospital and given his underlying tendency to aspirate as well as his diaphragmatic paralysis, it was agreed that the patient should undergo tracheostomy and more protracted coarse of weaning from the ventilator.
Cardiovascular:  As discussed in History of Present Illness, the patient had a troponin leak thought secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of anemia and hypotension while in the SICU that was managed medically.
The patient also had a transthoracic echocardiogram while in the SICU which showed evidence of small ASD with left to right shunt.
Following his PEA arrest on [**12-17**], the patient developed atrial fibrillation.
The patient had had his hypertension managed with hydralazine while he was NPO after being weaned off pressors.
However, the patient's antibiotics were stopped after patient had a TTE that was negative for endocarditis, a full body CT scan which showed no evidence of abscess and his pleural effusion showed no evidence of infectious etiology either.
Following the PEA arrest, though, which was on [**12-17**] and thought to be associated with an aspiration event, the patient was started on Ceftaz and Flagyl.
The patient completed a 14 day course of Ceftaz and Flagyl and had remission of his leukocytosis.
Deep venous thrombosis:  Patient was noted to have right greater than left arm swelling on the 17th.
The patient underwent right upper extremity ultrasound and was noted to have a deep venous thrombosis in his subclavian and basilic vein given the concern for clotting of his hemodialysis catheter.
This was continued through [**12-20**] at which time it was decided that his right IJ was a potential source of infection and should be discontinued.
The patient was restarted on tube feeds which he tolerated at a slow rate initially before becoming nauseous and developing an elevated lipase for which the tube feeds were stopped.
Given the patient's complicated abdominal anatomy, it was decided to consult surgery for open PEG placement which was pending at the time of this dictation.
Psych:  The patient was considerably anxious during his hospitalization which was controlled with Ativan.
Gastrointestinal - nausea - vomiting:  On the 25th, the patient developed nausea and vomiting.
