Intracranial grid placement.
Reactivation of vagal nerve stimulator.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 32-year-old right-handed female who was admitted for long-term monitoring after intracranial placement of left frontal and temporal grid and strips, with a past history of intractable focal epilepsy, left cerebral atrophy, and left medial temporal sclerosis.
She has frequent partial complex seizures consisting of an altered level of consciousness with no clear evidence on EEG of any electrographic changes.
The patient has a long history of seizures since age 11, when they were generalized tonic-clonic in nature.
She had remission of her seizures from age 16 to age 22.
Her current seizures present as spells of facial twitching mainly on the right side.
She reports that these twitches progressed to bilateral arm stiffness and twitching of the right leg.
Her most recent admission for LTM in [**2179-7-26**] did not detect any EEG changes with her clinical seizures.
An EEG in [**2176**] revealed very frequent runs of bifrontal central high amplitude spike and slow wave discharges lasting up to 3-4 minutes at times, almost evolving into a focal status involving both frontocentral regions.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
She has a vagal nerve stimulator which was placed several years ago with no improvement.
She also had seizures beginning at age 11 with remission from age of 16 to 22.
History of right arm fracture.
History of right leg fracture.
Cervical cancer treated with laser surgery.
Her MR scan showed left cerebral atrophy.
Neuropsych evaluation showed slow processing speech, impaired language function, and poor memory.
In general, she was mildly obese with her head wrapped in an EEG turban.
She had no nystagmus.
Her palate elevated symmetrically.
She had no lower extremity clonus.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 32-year-old female with a long history of seizures co-mixed with possible motor conversion disorder, admitted after placement of grid and strips intracranially to try and characterize whether her altered consciousness and frequent right face twitching represent seizures or conversion disorder.
An EEG obtained on [**2-2**] showed that she was having frequent seizures from her left motor strip.
Her initial hematocrit was 24 with low iron studies.
A head CT was performed because she was having high fevers.
She continued to spike fevers with negative blood cultures.
Because of the need to prevent seizures during the brain mapping, the patient did receive an IV load of Dilantin, as well as a po load, to keep her level between 15 and 20.
