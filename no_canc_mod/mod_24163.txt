Initial EKG at OSH showed inferolateral ST depressions, with troponin I of 1.77, BNP of 2160  Patient was given ASA, lasix 20 mg IV, and started on a heparin and nitro drip and transferred to BIMDC for further evaluation and possible cath.
The ST depressions were subjectively better and patient was chest pain free.
She was noted to be in new renal failure, with creatinine of 3.2.
Patient was admitted to the CCU because of high oxygen requirement.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools/bleeding from rectum.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current chest pain, although had left CP previous.
+ ankle edema, gets short of breath with walking around.
no palpitations or syncope   Past Medical History: 1.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: gout hypothyroidism anxiety   Social History: -Tobacco history:  quit over 10 years ago, use to smoke 1 pack per day for 'many years' -ETOH:  none -1 son who has prostate cancer and is a source of anxiety, 2 daughters, 7 grandchildren  Family History: patient denies FH of heart disease and diabetes.
Left atrial abnormality.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy versus ischemia.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities may be due to myocardial ischemia and left ventricular hypertrophy.
Since the previous tracing of [**2169-9-16**] sinus tachycardia is absent and further ST-T wave changes are seen.
Echo [**9-16**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the interventricular septum, anterior free wall, lateral wall, and apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild diffuse interstitial edema and vascular congestion are present.
Bilateral pleural effusions are seen, moderate on the right and small on the left, withsilhouetting of the right heart border and hemidiaphragm.
Bibasilar atelectasis or consolidation is present.
Diffuse osseous mineralization is seen.
IMPRESSION: Congestive heart failure.
There is no evidence of stones, mass, or hydronephrosis.
Despite limitations of study, this is suggestive of renal artery stenosis.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis on the right.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo F with history of HTN, DM, hypercholesterolemia, originally presented to OSH with increasing shortness of breath over the last four days with EKG concerning for NSTEMI and elevated Cr concerning for new renal failure.
# Shortness of breath:  The patient presented in acute congestive heart failure, likely secondary to the patient's NSTEMI.
A BNP was 15,555 and the patient's chest x-ray showed frank pulmonary edema.
The lasix drip was able to be discontinued and she contined to have no shortness of breath on room air.
She was transferred from the CCU to the regular cardiology floor and remained there with no difficulty.
# Coronaries/NSTEMI:  The patient had elevated cardiac enzymes on admission that peaked at peaked with MB at 29, CK at 293, Trop at 1.32.
She also had EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
She was going to go for cardiac catheterization, however because of her renal failure, this was deferred and she was medically managed.
She remained chest pain free through her hospitalization.
# Renal failure - The patient was noted to have elevated creatinine on admission to 3.2, from a baseline of 1.8 according to her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] this had not been checked for a couple of years.
It was unknown why her renal failure was progressing.
It was initially thought to be related to fluid overload and the patient having poor renal perfusion, however her renal function did not improve with diuresis.
Urine microscopy was obtained and showed a bland sediment with no casts.
A renal ultrasound was obtained which was suggestive for left renal artery stenosis.
She remained asymptomatic from her elevated BUN and Cr except for some mild itching that was controlled with Sarna lotion.
# Anemia - The patient was anemic on admission, with a Hct that went to 23.9.
She did have one guaiac positive stool, however she had no melena or bright red blood per rectum.
A peripheral smear showed no schistocytes and her hemolysis labs were negative.
# DM: Because the patient had renal failure, her metformin was held.
# Hypothyroidism - Continued levothyroxine 75mcg daily .
# Gout - Colchicine was discontinued due to the patients renal failure.
She did not complain of any joint pain and did not have any signs of gout.
