She had a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation and a prior right parietal cerebrovascular accident.
She had a known right internal carotid artery stenosis from her carotid ultrasound.
The family noted that she had a slight facial droop early in the day but, by mid-afternoon, she had a pronounced facial droop and then left arm weakness, with the hand being most affected.
She described a moderate headache and mild neck pain, no visual changes, no confusion, no trauma, no fever or chills, no chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the above, the patient was heparinized, with a first partial thromboplastin time of 50 to 70 after she seemed to have an embolic stroke.
At the end of the procedure, the patient still had the persistent left upper extremity paresis, although her facial droop seemed somewhat improved.
Her left upper extremity paresis and findings on admission were unchanged.
She was afebrile and otherwise neurologically intact except for the admission exam, which was unchanged on discharge.
