Past Medical History: 1. hypertension 2. hypercholesterolemia 3. peptic ulcer disease 4. colocutaneous fistula status post low anterior resection, colostomy, and a loop ileo-ostomy [**2154**] 5. history of pneumonia - 5 months ago in [**Country 3587**], spent 10 days in hospital 6. denies history of CAD or diabetes (however, metformin was on med list in [**8-18**] in OMR)   Social History: He lives with his daughter, he is retired from instructing at a driving school.
Physical Exam: VS - Temp , BP , HR , R , O2-sat % RA GENERAL - well-appearing man in NAD, comfortable, appropriate HEENT - NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear NECK - supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD, LUNGS - CTA bilat, no w/r/c, decreased breath sounds at bases L>R, go aeration, repirations unlabored HEART - RRR, nl s1, s2, II/VI SEM heard best at the R and L USB, no peripheral edema ABDOMEN - soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding +BS EXTREMITIES - His right hand is cool compared to his left, with 1+ radial pulse on the right and 2+ radial pulse on the left.
He  has an AVG in his right upper arm: strong bruit present, fistula site with stitches in place, no surrounding erythema or tenderness.
SKIN - no rashes or lesions LYMPH - no cervical, supraclavicular LAD NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength  [**5-19**] on the right, and [**6-18**] on the left  Pertinent Results: [**2160-10-16**] CT chest: No filling defects are seen within the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism.
There is mild aortic atherosclerosis as well atherosclerosis at the origin of the great vessels.
Coronary artery shows extensive calcifications as well.
Compared to [**2160-9-24**], there is a new development of moderate-large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Pleural effusions are dependent and without evidence of loculation.
There is compressive atelectasis of the lower lobes bilaterally, right greater than left and of the right middle lobe as well.
Collapsed lung parenchyma does enhance normally, arguing against pneumonia, however, there are fluid-filled airways in the right lower lobe which likely reflects retained secretions.
There is no evidence for pulmonary edema within the lung parenchyma.
Scattered centrilobular emphysema is again noted.
Borderline enlarged right paratracheal lymph node is essentially unchanged from the prior study.
AP lymph node and prevascular lymph nodes as well as upper right paratracheal lymph nodes have slightly increased in size but do not meet pathologic size criteria.
Similarly, borderline right hilar lymph node measuring nearly 1 cm in short axis is possibly slightly larger than the prior study, again, likely reactive.
A subcarinal lymph node is also borderline and unchanged.
There is trace pericardial fluid, slightly increased from prior.
Visualized portions below the diaphragm show no definite abnormality.
Visualized portions of the base of the neck also show no definite abnormality.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bone findings with multilevel mild disc degeneration in thoracic spine.
2.Marked increase in bilateral pleural effusions since [**2160-9-24**] CT, with moderate-large right pleural effusion and moderate left pleural effusion without complication to suggest infection.
No definite evidence of pulmonary edema.
[**2160-10-16**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color Doppler and pulsed Doppler imaging of the left and right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins demonstrate normal venous flow, compressibility and augmentation.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right or left lower extremity DVT.
Grossly patent right upper extremity hemodialysis fistula.
No collections identified about the fistula.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
There is bilateral lower lobe volume loss that has worsenedcompared to the study from two days prior.
Old rib fractures are again seenin the left.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right.
HgA1c ([**10-16**]): 5.2   Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old male with COPD, CHF, ESRD with recent hospitalization for initiation of dialysis who presents with acute respiratory distress likely secondary COPD flare and volume overload.
Intubated prior to arrival, extubated in MICU without complication and transferred to floor with continued improvement of respiratory status.
#Respiratory Distress: Mostly likely secondary to hypervolumic state and COPD flare.
Due to patients severely compromised respiratory status on admission (requiring intubation prior to arriva to BIDMCl) ICU treated with course of abx (cipro, ceftriaxone) for ?HAP/HCAP/aspiration PNA.
Patient extubated on [**10-16**] without difficulty.
CT also was neg for PE and LENIS neg for DVT.
COPD flare was treated initially with 4d course of prednisone 40mg PO, azithromycin 500mg PO QD x5 days as well as ipratropium and albuterol nebs as needed.
Regarding volume (recent EF: 45%, CKD V), patient with new bilateral pleural effusions on imaging.
Patient dialyzed on Sat, Tues, Thurs schedule for removal of excess fluid with lasix administered on days not receiving dialysis.
# Right forearm swelling.
Initial concern for possible hematoma or thrombosis.
U/S without sign of DVT or hematoma.
Arm also evaluated by transplant surgery who were not to hematoma or thrombosis; dialysis continued as scheduled with [**Last Name **] problem with flow.
# Hypertension.
Patient complained of dizziness on mornings of [**10-19**] and [**10-20**].
Nifedipine dosing switched to 30mg CR PO BID to minimize deleterious effects in morning and better control BP at night.
# CKD stage V complicated by anemia: HD recently initiated on [**2160-9-29**].
#H/o CVA s/p CEA.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SOB, dyspnea.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation twice a day as needed for wheezing and SOB.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2)  Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY COPD Exacerbation Chronic Kidney Disease Congestive Heart Failure  Secondary Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental status: clear and coherent Able to ambulate without assistance   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because you were experiencing shortness of breath.
You were also found to have excess fluid in your lungs which was attributed to your underlying heart and kidney disease.
The dialysis team performed dialysis 3x/week to remove excess fluid and manage your electrolytes.
