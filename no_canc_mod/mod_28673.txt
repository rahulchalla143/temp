Admission Date:  [**2115-4-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-5-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2038-1-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: Low back pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CT guided drainage of psoas abscess TEE   History of Present Illness: 77 yo F w/ AF, htn, "enlarged heart," DM, hx UTI, multiple joint replacements, who transferred from [**Hospital **] w/ 1 week LBP (l-s and R paraspinal), nausea.
l-s neg, CT abd w/o contrast showed no kidney stones.
ESR [**Hospital 66783**] so transferred for concern of epidural abscess.
MR revealed no epidural abscess and CT abdomen revealed small right psoas phlegmon.
Based on the initial admission imaging, radiology felt fluid collection too small and not amenable to percutaneous drainage.
Past Medical History: AS HTN chronic AF on coumadin DJD with multiple joint replacements (R hip [**2105**], R knee [**2108**], L knee [**2109**], R shoulder [**2111**]) NIDDM S/P cholecystectomy [**2106**]  Social History: 5 Children, very supportive.

[**4-27**] CXR: Bibasilar atelectasis.
Pneumonia is not excluded.
[**4-27**] MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1093**]:  Multilevel degenerative changes with severe stenosis of left neural foramina at L5-S1 level.
No evidence of epidural abscess, discitis or osteomyelitis.
[**4-27**] Abd/Pelvic CT:  Small right psoatic phlegmon.
Small (8 x 16 mm) barely perceptible heterogeneity in the right psoas muscle, without discernable fluid collection.
No associated bony destruction or extension into the spinal canal.
Small amount retroaortic soft tissue which [**Known firstname **] be related to anasarca, but paraaortic fibrosis [**Known firstname **] also be considered.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with associated compressive atelectasis.
Coronary vascular and valvular calcifications.
[**4-29**] Transthoracic ECHO: There is moderate to severe aortic stenosis with a mild decrease in LV function.
No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
[**4-30**] Xray Hips: No evidence for prosthetic loosening; baseline films not available for comparison.
[**4-30**] CT chest: 1) Diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs with septal thickening, likely due to hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
2) Few scattered small nodules in both lungs in the presence of a left hilar calcified lymph node, likely the sequelae of prior granulomatous infectious exposure.
There appearance is not suggestive of septic emboli.
However, if clinical suspicion for pulmonary infection persists, short-term followup CT [**Known firstname **] be helpful to exclude active infection.
3) Interval increase in the bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
4) Slight interval increase in the prominent retrocrural soft tissue density.
There is no CT evidence of osteomyelitis.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium, left atrial appendage and body of the right atrium.The left and left atrial appendage emptying velocities are depressed (<0.2m/s),  but no thrombus is seen.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color  Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Aortic stenosis is present (not quantified) No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace  aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets with aortic stenosis and trace aortic regurgitation.
Thickened mitral leaflets with mild mitral  regurgitation.
No discrete vegetation or abscess identified.
Poor LAA and RAA  ejection velocities with spontaneous echo contrast in both atria.
Compared to the previous examinations, there has been the development of numerous ring-enhancing masses in both psoas muscles and in the paraaortic retroperitoneal space of the lower thoracic region.
This is consistent with progressive infection.
Paraaortic abnormality is noted as superiorly as T10, though the most superior extent of this abnormality is not included on these scans.
There are no signs of an enhancing intraspinal mass or epidural collection to indicate spread of infection into the intraspinal space.
There are no signs of osteomyelitis at this time.
IMPRESSION: Worsening of a paraspinal infection with multiple enlarging abscesses around the thoracic aorta and in the psoas muscles.
Uncomplicated CT-guided aspiration of left periaortic abscess.
Psoas abscess aspiration was not attempted due to poor visualization by contrast-enhanced CT scan.
Slight interval enlargement of left para-aortic retroperitoneal collection, which is slightly hyperdense at the biopsy site, suggesting possible small hematoma at the biopsy site.
Right para-arotic collection is stable.
No evidence of aortic dissection.
Similar evidence of fluid overload.
The paraaortic abnormality is noted superiorly at the T9 vertebrae, the most superior extent of the axial images on this examination.
Nonenhancing portions of this fluid collection [**Known firstname **] represent a hemorrhage as the patient is status post drainage.
Of note is increased enhancement of the T12/L1 disc on STIR images with abnormal signal also demonstrated in the inferior T12 endplate.
There is no osseous destruction of the vertebral endplates.
No epidural collections are noted.
There is no abnormal signal intensity in the spinal cord.
IMPRESSION: Worsening paraspinal infection with multiple abscesses around the thoracic aorta and in the psoas muscles.
T12/L1 discitis with no evidence of erosive endplate changes.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  77 y/o F with back pain found to have right psoas phlegmon, also presented with dyspnea and hyponatremia.
# Psoas abscesses/MSSA bacteremia/Discitis: Patient presented with low back pain to OSH and was found to have an elevated ESR.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for MRI of spine which ruled out epidural abscess and osteomyelitis, however it showed inflammation of the right psoas muscle.
Follow up abdominal CT scan showed a small right psoas plegmon.
CT chest showed no evidence of other infectious foci, but did show possible increase in size of right psaos phlegmon and prevertebral soft tissue density.
Repeat MRI of L-spine with gadolinium showed worsening of the abscesses.
Patient's back pain was controlled with tylenol #3 (unable to tolerate any stronger narcotics/pain medications).
TTE and TEE showed no valvular vegetations.
The patient had a CT guided aspiration on [**2115-5-4**] of 5 cc of pus which grew MSSA.
The following day she complained of left sided chest pain radiating to her back.
CT torso showed no PE or aortic dissection, but did demonstrate retrocrural hematoma at site of drainage.
Neurosurgery was consulted and felt the patient was not a surgical candidate for her discitis and recommended f/u MRI and f/u appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**], appt on [**6-26**].
She will need weekly CBC, LFTs, bun/creat while on oxacillin as this can cause liver and kidney damage or cytopenia.
# SOB:  On arrival to the medicine floor the patient was tachypneic, ABG showed mild alveolar hypoventilation with 7.38/48/106 on 2L 02 NC.
CXR did not show pneumonia, but CT showed bilateral moderate sized pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema.
The day after her CT guided drainage at which time she had required 5 units of FFP to reverse her INR, she developed increased difficulty breathing, serum bicarb noted to be 42.
Most likely due to decreased ventilation with pain meds/sedation post procedure as well as volume overload.
If rales recur please consider need for diuresis given her aortic stenosis.
She has findings consistent with both pulmonary htn and copd and will be fully evaluated with PFTs by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at her mid [**Known firstname 116**] appintment.
# Hyponatremia:  Patient was initially diuresed due to concern for hypervolemic hyponatremia.
Patient was fluid restricted for possible SIADH from either pain, infection, or pleural effusions and her sodium improved to 127.
There was no evidence of a lung nodule or other pulmonary process to account for her SIADH.
Patient continued to be mildly hyponatremic and in review of prior records with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] seems she has been hyponatremic periodically since at least 8/[**2114**].
# CV:  Patient has known Afib and aortic stenosis, by TTE her aortic valve area was 0.8, EF 40-50%.
Daily EKGs showed new TWI in anterior leads since admission with no elevation in cardiac enzymes.
Patient continued to be in Afib with occasional tachycardia to 140's and occasional 2 second pauses, metoprolol was switched to 50 mg TID.
Cardiology consulted and recommended titrating up metoprolol due to intermittent tachycardia and stopping digoxin and ACE inhibitor.
It is imperative that this stay therapuetic as there was "smoke" seen in the left atrium by trans-esophageal echo.
Will likely need repeat UA and if still hematuria then cystoscopy as outpatient for further work up.
# FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet, low sodium .
