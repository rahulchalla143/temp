At that time, his blood pressure was measured and found to be low at 90/50, with a heart rate in 40's-50's, and unmeasurable temperature.

Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is exuberant callus formation about a healed fracture of the proximal femur.
There is no evidence of gas in soft tissues or erosive change to suggest this as a source of spreading infection.
Bibasilar aspiration versus atelectasis.
No acute intra-abdominal process.
Mild colonic diverticulosis without acute diverticulitis.
Focal hypodense area within the prostate adjacent to the urethra, correlate with history of prior TURP.
If none, findings may represent prostate lesion.
CXR [**5-15**]: HISTORY: Altered mental status with hypothermia and fluid resuscitation.
There is still some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, which could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
No definite discrete pneumonia is appreciated at this time.
Given history of pituitary adenoma status-post resection, central cause appeared likely on admission.
The patient only had hypothermia to fit SIRS criteria.
Significantly he had two similar admissions one to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital, the other to [**Hospital1 112**] with similar symptoms and without clear etiology.
When pt came out of the ICU he continued to have intermittent hypothermia into the 93-96 degree range.
Pt always warmed back up to 95-97 on next vital sign check and never had any symptoms related to his hypothermia.
Concern for Endocrine or Neurologic basis of low temps, BP, and HR prompted a consult to both services.
Neurology noted that vital signs abnormalities could be [**12-19**] to autonomic dysfunction or a parkinson-plus type syndrome, but that further work-up would likely not change management and that work-up would also be difficult [**12-19**] to patient's demented state.
Two IV fluid boluses for blood pressure elevation were given and broad antibiotic coverage for hospital acquired pna were administered(vancomycin and Levofloxacin) in the ICU.
On the morning of [**2142-5-16**], the patient appeared much improved, he was afebrile, without leukocytosis with two normal chest xrays.
The hypotension resolved and pt later became hypertensive while on the medicine floor.
No further episodes of hypotension were noted during the hospitalization.
# Bradycardia:Pt presented with significant bradycardia but after treatment in the ICU his heart rates came back up into normal range.
During the evening of [**5-20**] pt was noted to have pseudonormalization of his T segments in a diffuse distribution on EKG.
Pt continued to be brady in the 30-50s for the rest of admission with his EKG showing sinus rhythm with a prolong PR interval.
A very occasional pause of 2 seconds was noted on tele, but was not deemed warrant further intervention or work-up.
Pt remained asymptomatic during all these episodes.
While the [**Hospital6 2910**] cultures came back negative, one bottle from [**5-18**] at [**Hospital1 18**] came back positive for coag negative staph with sensativities identical to the earlier specimen.
Valves could not be adequately visualized to assess for possibility of endocarditis.
Although ID was suspicious that these cultures were both contaminants, they recommended antibiotics (either Vanco or Linezolid) be continued to finish a 14 day course from the 7/2 blood culture (finishing day [**5-31**]).
Pt was discharge on Vancomycin when sent home to nursing facility as a PICC line had been placed later in his admission and the nursing facility was inclined to use Vanco over Linezolid for cost-efficiency reasons.
#) Altered Mental Status.
There was a question of mental status changes on admission, the patient reportadly ate only 40% of his dinner which is highly unusual for him.
#) Bright red blood per rectum: Initially there was some concern that patient was haivng rectal bleeding as there was note documentation of BRBPR and a Hct drop after admission.
However, upon further investigation, it was determined that this had been inadvertently added to the medical record from an old hospital admission and that patient was not actually bleeding during this admission.
His Hct stayed stable the rest of the admission and on evidence of rectal bleeding was ever observed.
#) Dementia: Pt with diagnosis of AD, as well as s/p CVA (remote).
#) Anemia: Normocytic anemia in a patient with chronic disease.
Given iron studies (Ferritin 895, TIBC 213, TRF 164) and clinical picture, his anemia is likely a mixed picture of anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, and hemodilution.
Downward trending hct in-house most likely secondary to hemodilution.
He does not seem to be bleeding as guaiac neg and imaging neg and hemodynamically stable.
However, enzymes and clinical situation did not indicate any ACS type event so patient was returned to home Zocor dose at discharge.
Polyvinyl Alcohol-Povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**11-18**] Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
Questionable coag negative staph bacteremia 2.
Questionable autonomic dysregulation with hypothermia, low blood pressure, and bradycardia.
Secondary Diagnosis: - Dementia (Alzheimer's) - Hypothyroidism - Far-advanced pituitary adenoma s/p resection in [**2135**] - History of CVA - Renal insufficiency - Anemia - H/o syphilis - Prostatic enlargement - Depression - Hyperlipidemia - GERD - Amputation of fingers of left hand   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Your nursing facility had sent you to [**Hospital6 **] with concerns for low heart-rate, low temperature, low blood pressure, and concerns that you only ate a small amount of your lunch.
Although they were briefly stopped, we re-started you on antibiotics because two different blood cultures grew a bacteria called coag negative staph.
An ultra-sound of your heart showed no evidence of endocartitis.
Neurology indicated that you may have some nerve dysfucntion causing low blood pressure, low heart rate, and low temperatures or that you may have some parkinsons type symptoms.
However, they said the diagnosis would not change how you are cared for and no further tests were run.
You never showed symptoms from this and were carefully monitored.
Your urine function was found to be slightly abnormal with a creatinine of 1.5 at discharge.
Followup Instructions: PCP as per protocol No need to follow up as an outpatient with infectious disease, endocrinology, or neurology.
