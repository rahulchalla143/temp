The patient presented to the Emergency Department on [**5-23**] and was given sublingual nitrogen x3 with a decrease in base to 5 from 10.
The patient's pain was reproducible by palpation below the pacemaker placement site and with deep inspiration.
The patient experienced nausea and vomiting one time in the Emergency Department for which she was given droperidol.
The patient vomited one more time in the Emergency Room and the patient continued to report pain with deep inspiration.
Status post pacer placement [**4-30**] for biventricular failure 2.
Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction of 15% 3.
Diabetes mellitus.
She has nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy.
Hypercholesterolemia 5.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline of 1.5 to 2.5 secondary to her diabetes 7.
Esophagitis anemia  ALLERGIES:  SERAX, CODEINE, PERCOCET, DEMEROL, SULFA  ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1.
ABDOMEN:  She was distended, positive bowel sounds.
She was soft without tenderness.
Electrocardiogram was AV paced and she had T-wave changes in V1 and V2.
Chest x-ray:  No evidence of congestive heart failure or cardiomegaly and an echocardiogram from [**2111-1-23**] showed an ejection fraction of 15%.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY DATES:  On [**5-24**], the patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction by enzymes and she was sent to the CCU for low blood pressure.
On [**5-25**], pericardiocentesis was attempted in the catheter lab, but patient coded.
On [**5-28**], the patient was progressing in the SICU, but developed rapid atrial fibrillation, so she was transferred to the CCU, started on amiodarone and the patient spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm.
On [**6-6**], her creatinine peaked at 4.2 and they had to back off the Lasix due to renal failure.
On [**6-16**], the patient was called out to the floor for placement and all central lines were pulled except for the hemodialysis tunneled catheter.
On [**6-17**], the patient had an episode of blood loss from the site where a previous groin line was pulled, but it resolved with pressure.
On [**6-18**], the patient started to have significant bleeding from the hemodialysis tunneled catheter site and the patient was unable to go to the rehabilitation given this issue.
There was an episode of chest pain and the patient was ruled out by enzymes.
They stopped Protonix and started to check labs for concern of a chronic DIC picture.
The patient started to show a chronic DIC picture on [**6-24**] with increased fibrin degradation products, increased D-dimer, normal fibrinogen with normal PT/PTT and decreased platelets in the setting of breathing around the catheter site.
On [**6-24**], as well, the patient experienced chest pain and was ruled in by enzymes with a troponin max of 9.4 and flat CKs.
Bleeding around the catheter site stopped on [**6-26**].
Chronic DIC 2.
