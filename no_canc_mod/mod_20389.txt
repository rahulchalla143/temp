Admission Date:  [**2101-3-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-3-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2036-8-26**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old gentleman admitted to the CCU following catheterization for an ST elevation MI.
The patient was home at rest when 2:00 pm of admission noted acute onset of substernal chest pain associated with shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis.
He presented to the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Room at 4:00 and noted to have ST elevations in V1 through V4 and reciprocal inferior depressions, given IV Nitroglycerin, morphine, Plavix, aspirin without resolution of the pain, and transferred emergently to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.
He had a thrombotic occlusion in the proximal LAD and stenotic distal LAD about 90% which were treated with Hepacoat bare metal stents.
Also noted to have an 80% lesion of the mid left circumflex and co-dominant right RCA with proximal PDA lesion which was not intervened on.
The patient had runs of VT and was started on lidocaine drip.
The patient had temporary pacing wires placed, rate of 60.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No alcohol or drugs.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  He is afebrile with an arterial blood pressure of 95/57, PA pressure 39/20, heart rate 110, respiratory rate 18, sats 94% on 2 liters.
In general, he was pleasant, alert, in no acute distress, with flattened bed with intra-arterial balloon pump in place.
Extremities - no edema, 2+ distal pulses.
No hematoma or bruits.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 65-year-old gentleman, with an ST elevation MI of the LAD, now admitted with cardiogenic shock.
The patient remained chest pain free throughout the course of his stay, status post stent.
2) CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  The patient initially came in under cardiogenic shock and was initially on Neo-Synephrine and dopamine drips, in addition to the interatrial balloon pump, which he tolerated well.
He was initially started on low dose ACE and low dose Toprol XL, and was started on Coumadin for prophylaxis for LV thrombus, in light of his large MI and decreased wall motion abnormality.
The patient will actually go home on Lovenox, as he will return for an ICD placement per the electrophysiology team secondary to his low EF and episodes of NSVT.
He was otherwise stable, but then throughout the course of his stay he had recurrent episodes of NSVT, and plans were made per electrophysiology team to return in 3 week's time to have an ICD placed.
4) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  This was new onset likely secondary to his MI and worsening heart failure.
The patient did have an episode of atrial tachycardia during the course of his stay which did respond to low dose beta blockers, and again the patient will return for ICD placement.
5) DIABETES:  Patient with poor glucose control throughout the course of his stay.
Amiodarone was eventually weaned off as well, and the patient remained in sinus with occasional episodes of atrial tachycardia as described above.
6) ANEMIA:  The patient had a history of GI bleed and was transfused over the course of his stay to keep a goal hematocrit greater than 30.
ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Arrhythmias - ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Diabetes mellitus 5.
