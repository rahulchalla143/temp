Admission Date:  [**2169-1-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-1-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-6-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: sudden cardiac arrest; ventricular fibrillation arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None this hospitalization  History of Present Illness: This is a 59 year-old Male with a PMH significant non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (cardiac MRI showing dilated LV with mild-to-moderate global systolic dysfunction, EF 42%, mild MR in [**2165**]), HLD, known LBBB who was in bed this morning at 7:45 AM and his wife noted him to be unresponsive with agonal breathing.
There was ROSC and he had some spontaneous movements, but he remained unresponsive on arrival to the [**Hospital3 78558**] ED.
The evening prior to his AM arrest, he was without any complaints and fell asleep comfortably.
He was intubated (had spontaneous respirations, dilated pupils, rechecked at 3-4 mm) and sedated with a Propofol gtt.
EKG showed sinus rhythm with known LBBB.
Hypothermia protocol was initiated and he was given 2L chilled normal saline and reached a core temperature of 32.6 degrees Celsius.
His rhythm strip demonstrated sinus tachycardia to the 110s with left-bundle morphology noted.
A repeat 2D-Echo in [**2165-3-30**] revealed a LVEF of 20% with global hypokinesis.
A cardiac MRI was performed [**7-/2165**], showing an effective forward LVEF of 39% without evidence of scarring or infarction.
Given these findings, he was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Electrophysiology clinic, and he recommended repeating a 2D-Echo, which was done in [**8-/2167**] and showed an LVEF of 40-45% and thus ICD placement was deferred at that time.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient arrived on cooling protocol and was minimally responsive given sedation and paralyzation.
His rhythm was sinus tachycardia to the 110s with a left bundle-branch morphology.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.

Family History: His family history is notable for heart failure and sudden cardiac death in a maternal aunt at the age of 57 years.
His brother died of sudden cardiac death at age 55 years this past week.
His mother died of presumed cardiac disease at age 76.
NECK: supple without lymphadenopathy.

There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or mediastinal widening.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 59M with a PMH significant for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (cardiac MRI showing dilated LV with mild-to-moderate global systolic dysfunction, EF 42%, mild MR in [**2165**]), HLD, known LBBB who is status-post sudden cardiac arrest (with undetermined rhythm) who had ROSC after shocks and CPR who is now intubated, sedated, paralyzed and on a hypothermia protocol, and is now hemodynamically stable.
# STATUS-POST SUDDEN CARDIAC (VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION) ARREST - The patient presented with a witnessed sudden cardiac arrest event the morning of admission - rhythm strip consistent with ventricular fibrillation (torsades de Pointes appearance).
He has no known coronary disease given his clean coronaries (per report) on cardiac catheterization in [**2165**].
Etiologies for sudden cardiac arrest included ACS versus arrhythmia, enzymes flat and EKG with LBBB but not meeting criteria for ACS.
Likely this was arrhythmia related from some congenital defect, as he has a strong family history of SCD.
We started empiric heparinization of the patient given his ACS/MI and empiric concerns for pulmonary emboli.
We also started Aspirin, Atorvastatin and Metoprolol given the concern for acute coronary syndrome; but ultimately his cardiac biomarkers were reassuring and he had no new wall motion abnormalities on 2D-Echo so atorvastatin was discontinued and his aspirin was lowered to 81mg.
His CTA chest was negative for pulmonary embolus and his heparin gtt was discontinued.
A 48-hour EEG was continued per post-arrest protocol and showed no evidence of epileptiform foci, only moderate global encephalopathy.
A 2D-Echo showed no evidence of focal wall motion abnormality and his LVEF was stable as compared to prior.
He had no focal neurologic deficits.
He required cardiac MR imaging on [**1-26**] that showed no change from his previous cardiac MR, with EF 45%, no late gadolinium enhancement and a small anteroseptal wall motion abnormality that wasn't specific to one particular coronary distribution and was likely the result of the arrest.
He will have to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-23**] for an EP study and cardiac cath on [**2-24**] to further identify any etiology for his vfib arrest.
# NON-ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY - The patient had a 2D-Echo which showed an LVEF of 30% by 2D-Echo in [**12/2163**] that was performed after an office EKG was noted to be abnormal (Q-waves in the inferior leads).
A repeat 2D-Echo in [**5-/2165**] revealed a LVEF of 20% with global hypokinesis.
A cardiac MRI was performed [**7-/2165**], showing an effective forward LVEF of 39% without evidence of scarring or infarction.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - The patient had no prior hyperlipidemia history, but a strong family history of coronary disease.
His lipid panel was overall reassuring and ultimately atorvastatin was discontinued as it was felt that his arrest was likely related to arrhythmia rather than ACS/atherosclerosis.
