HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70 year old female with a history of coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease recently admitted status post fall with surgical resection of damaged lung parenchyma, multiple compound rib fractures.
Her course was complicated by acute abdominal infections.
She was found to have a gangrenous right colon status post colectomy with end ileostomy, second look on [**10-23**] small bowel resection and end ileostomy preceded by third look, found to have small bowel perforations times two.
She had multiple bowel resections with end jejunostomy.
She was placed on a tracheostomy on [**11-9**] and was noted to have positive Klebsiella sputum Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas at that time; she was discharged on [**11-21**] to rehabilitation on TPN via PICC line.
She presents this evening after two day history of fever, temperature around 103.0 F., mild abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
No diarrhea and no bright red blood per ostomy.
She was cultured on [**2167-11-4**], and found to have GPCs in blood and was sent to [**Hospital1 69**].
The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service for septic shock physiology.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent in [**2162**].
Status post fall with multiple rib fractures, spontaneous pneumothorax and hemothorax requiring Intensive Care Unit level care.
Post care complications with gangrenous colon resection, small bowel perforation status post multiple bowel resections.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Nutritionally compromised secondary to short gut.
ALLERGIES:   Rash to penicillin; codeine with nausea and vomiting.
LABORATORY:  She was anemic with a hematocrit of 27.5, white blood cell count of 13.5 without left shift, hyponatremic at 122.
Sinus tachycardia on EKG at a rate of 130.
Echocardiogram on [**2167-10-20**] revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, left atrial mild dilatation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 70 year old female with coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease status post lengthy surgical admission requiring multiple bowel resections, who presented from a rehabilitation facility on TPN via PICC.
Started on Dopamine a.d., weaned off [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] of greater than 70; started on Vancomycin to cover Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus possible line infection.
Repeat blood cultures were drawn on [**12-2**] and [**1-10**], of which only [**1-5**] revealed C. albicans moderate growth.
The PICC line was discontinued and culture of tip grown again positive for fungemia and bacteremia.
Transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no presence of endocarditis or vegetations.
An ophthalmology consultation was obtained to rule out fungal retinopathy which was negative.
She was afebrile on hospital day one with a decreasing white count and no true evidence of leukocytosis or intra-abdominal process.
A CT scan of the abdomen was obtained given patient's multiple anastomoses with concern for abdominal abscess and/or free fluid collection.
CT scan of the abdomen revealed no abscess, no fluid collection and no intra-abdominal process.
The patient was weaned off pressors and successfully volume resuscitated and given one unit of packed red blood cells as well as normal saline boluses to maintain MAP.
The patient remained afebrile throughout hospital days two through ten with no leukocytosis, no physical examination findings suggestive of intra-abdominal process.
The patient has per report a history of a penicillin allergy.
Given lack of anaphylactic reaction or hives, a trial of Ampicillin was performed with 250 mg intravenously times once.
The patient did not have pruritus, rash, hives or any evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
without sequelae.
At outside hospital EKG with deep S waves and tachycardia.
Cycled enzymes revealed small troponin leak of 0.04.
In light of sepsis, likely due to demand ischemia without significant EKG changes.
One event on Telemetry in the Medical Intensive Care Unit pertinent for a 25 beat of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
No further events were recorded on Telemetry.
No significant findings on examination, although in light of extent of resection, the patient was unable to meet p.o.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and began continued tube feeds with goal of cycle tube feeds at night to meet 100% of nutritional requirements.
Pulmonary:  Initially with hypoxia on admission.
Chest x-ray with no clear indication of pneumonia nor aspiration pneumonia.
The patient remained on nebulizers and aggressive pulmonary toilet, appropriately diuresing once hypotension resolved and mobilization of extra vascular fluid was achieved.
No requirements for insulin.
