History of Present Illness: Pt is 65yoM with h/o MMP including DM with retinopathy/neuropathy, HTN, s/p renal transplant, CAD< PVD, and complicated lumbar disease who is transferred from clinic with 3 weeks of worsening generalized weakness(Prox>distal).
He has had difficulty walking for ~10 years for multiple reasons including neuropathy, fractures, and complicated spinal surgeries.
This came on acutely, as he woke up one morning with arm pain bilaterally and right leg pain.
During this, he has not had visual or hearing changes.
No bowel/bladder changes, no dysarthria, no SOB, no dysphagia.
The pain has resolved, but the weakness remains.
He has intermittent foot numbness at baseline.
He also has baseline paresthesias and numbness in his fingers.
There is a question of a 5 pound weight loss in the past 3 weeks.
Past Medical History: 1.Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus 2.Nephropathy s/p renal transplant in 04/98 3.Peripheral vascular disease s/p stent placement in common iliac, external iliac, proximal SFA, repeat angioplasty of right common iliac and SFA, right common femoral to popliteal artery bypass graft.
4.Aortic Stenosis ??????
6.Diastolic dysfunction (EF>55%) 7.Hypertension 8.Retinopathy s/p bilateral cataract removal surgery 9.Charcot Foot 10.Cervical Stenosis s/p fusion of C3-5 11.Otitis Externa 12.Hearing Loss   Social History: Lives with his wife.
Family History: Mother: MI and DM.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors No apraxia, no neglect Able to tell a coherent story.
XII: Tongue midline without fasciculations, intact movements  Motor: Severe atrophy in UE and LE bilaterally.
No fasciculations seen today.
PP was hyperesthetic to knees bilaterally and to elbows bilaterally.
Severe degenerative changes at L4-5 disc space.
----- CXR:Hyperinflation, chronic and moderately severe is not as pronounced on today's study, perhaps by virtue of lordotic positioning.
Mild peribronchial infiltration in the right upper lung could be asymmetric edema or coexistent small airway inflammation.
There is no consolidation to suggest a bacterial pneumonia and no pleural effusion is present, but this could be a focal atypical (viral, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] mycoplasma) pneumonia.
Soft tissue thickening posteriorly at C4-5 level along with a large central and left paracentral disc herniation at C4-5 level result in severe spinal stenosis at this level.
Multilevel degenerative changes are seen at other levels.
Myelomalacia within the spinal cord with mild spinal cord atrophy at C3-4 level.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild mitral stenosis.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities consistent with ARDS or multifocal pneumonia.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
No acute intra-abdominal pathology identified.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 65 y/o M s/p kidney transplant, CAD, PVD, DMI, cervical hematoma, p/w nstemi and sepsis/resp failure [**3-9**] PNA after diskectomy .
His picture was initially unclear as this may represent a myopathy, a dysfuntion of multiple nerve roots, or a cervical cord lesion.
As it was an acute event, we wanted to rule out cord pathology first.
An MRI of the cervical spine showed a severe canal stenosis with cord impingement at L4-L5.
He also had some cord damage evidenced on the MRI.
This stenosis was felt to be the cause of his current acute on chronic weakness.
He also had some urinary frequency which was likely the result of a spastic bladder which is typical of upper spinal cord compression.
He was kept well hydrated before surgery to decrease his risk of cardiac complications from the procedure.
Patient remained asymptomatic and his VS were stable.
This was assessed as multi-factorial, related to acute CHF as well as PNA.
His respiratory distress and hypoxia improved over a couple of days with this treatment without the patient requiring mechanical ventilation.
Also likely presumed aspiration PNA given CXR findings and hx of emesis.
CHF was assessed to be contributing as well, given his cardiac history.
NSTEMI: He was noted to have elevated enzymes and ECG changes.
Echo showed no new wall motion abnormalities.
There is a history of CAD s/p PCI in '[**72**].
