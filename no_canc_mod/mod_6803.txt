Admission Date:  [**2178-12-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2178-12-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2101-4-19**]       Sex:  F  Service:  ACOVE  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old female nursing home resident who reportedly developed acute onset of shortness of breath on the morning of admission.
In the Emergency Department, a head CT demonstrated a moderate sized subacute to chronic-appearing infarct of the left parietal lobe, fairly prominent supratentorial hydrocephalus, somewhat nodular-appearing LMCA, and considerable thickening within the anterior aspect of the left nasal cavity.
Atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
?, tachypneic and arousable but did not answer any questions.
No obstructing lesions in the left nasal cavity per report.
There was no cervical lymphadenopathy.
Her neck was soft and supple.
There was accessory muscle use, and there was jugular venous distention to 10 cm.
Heart:  Heart rate was irregular, and there were very distant heart sounds.
Chest:  She had minimal air movement bilaterally with coarse breath sounds, wheezes, and rhonchi.
Extremities:  She had 2+ bipedal edema, 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema from the ankle to mid shin and 2+ dorsalis pedal pulses.
She had no skin lesions.
Electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial fibrillation versus atrial flutter at 70 beats per minute, slight right axis, normal QRS and QT intervals, Q-waves in leads AVL and V1, and no ST segment or T-wave changes.
Although she appeared to have an element of pulmonary edema on her chest x-ray, she did not have a diuretic response to Furosemide, and she remained in respiratory distress.
Given her persistent respiratory distress, the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring and treatment.
On transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was found to be in hypercapnic respiratory failure, and a repeat chest x-ray demonstrated a left-sided infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
She was also started on BIPAP for her respiratory failure which was subsequently used as needed for respiratory distress.
On [**2178-12-22**], the patient had an episode of respiratory distress with decreased oxygen saturations and increased respiratory rate.
She was subsequently found to have E. coli resistant to Levofloxacin on a urine culture, so her Ceftriaxone was continued.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, and echocardiogram was done that demonstrated an ejection fraction of 70%, small left ventricle, RVHK, left ventricular hypertrophy, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Of note, she also ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.
Given her impaired neurologic status, a swallowing evaluation was done.
The Speech Pathology Department subsequently recommended a diet of very moist, ground, and pureed foods with thin liquids.
She should not be given any solids or mixed consistencies.
The patient also subsequently developed hypernatremia that was likely thought to be due to a partial central diabetes insipidus.
The thought was that the patient had an elevated respiratory rate most likely as a consequence of her recent subacute cerebrovascular accident.
Her blood pressure remained elevated ranging between 160-190 systolic throughout her time on the Medicine Floor; therefore, her blood pressure medications were titrated up as noted below.
From a pulmonary point of view, she continued to breath easily as her underlying pneumonia was treated.
Of note, the patient was found to have MRSA in her sputum from a sputum culture sent while she was in the Intensive Care Unit.
While this finding was though to most likely represent contamination and not true infection, and given that the patient was clinically improving with a combination of Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone, the decision was made to not treat the patient for her MRSA in her sputum; however, should the patient clinically decompensate in the future, treatment of her MRSA should clearly be considered.
Hypercapnic respiratory failure.
Urinary tract infection.
Subacute cerebrovascular accident.
Atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
