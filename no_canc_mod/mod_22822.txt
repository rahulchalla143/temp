CT of abd/pelvis on [**5-17**] revealed a large clot at the junction of D1 and D2 with resultant proximal gastric distension.
There was significant friability and oozing.
On [**5-21**] CTA showed increasing size of the duodenal hematoma and an area concerning for active extravasation at D1.
Abd/Pelvic CT demonstrated a small anterior abdominal hematoma and a R paracolic gutter hematoma.
Active bleeding could not be assessed given that this was not a CTA.
The patient appeared stable and was transferred to the floor in the afternoon; however, by the evening his hct had fallen from 31 to 24, and the patient was transferred back to the SICU of CT of abdomen/pelvis showed partially loculated hematomas in ant omentum and R paracolic gutter with no evidence of bowel leak.
Hct did not increase despite multiple transfusions (hct down to 23 from 31)  On [**5-25**], he was taken back to the OR by surgeons, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3742**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for an exlap evacuation hematoma, suture ligation bleeding varix behind the head of the pancreas, and then suture ligation of bleeding varix in the anterior abdominal wall.
No thrombus was seen.
Biopsy during surgery revealed Duodenal ulcer with mural necrosis, and acute and chronic inflammation, consistent with perforation.
On [**5-27**] an abdominal CT was done for bilious drain output and tense abdomen.
Increased complex ascites was noted.
Given lack of enteric contrast extravasation and bilious catheter drainage, this is concerning for bile leak from the duodenal stump.
Volume overload was also noted with small bilateral pleural effusions and body wall edema.
On [**5-26**] he was extubated in AM, however, he became more tachycardic and tachypneic requiring reintubation.
The patient had fevers to 101.7 on POD 1 and 101.3 on POD 3.
Blood Cultures have been sent on multiple occasions and all have returned with no growth.
Fluid sent from the JP drains grew enterococcus and staph coag negative.
Antibiotics were switched to Vanco and [**Last Name (un) **] and micafungin was continued for broadened coverage due to bile leak from the duodenal stump.
nystatin oral solution started for thrush on [**5-29**].
He was kept NPO secondary to the antrectomy, and was continued on TPN via PICC line.
The patient was slowly started on sips to clears and then to regular diet, however PO intake has been very poor and calorie counts reflect less than half of caloric need being met.
JP drains have remained in place and continue to have bilious appearing drainage, output typically up to 100 cc daily in recent days.
CT of abdomen on [**6-2**] showed continued hematoma and new concern for colonic wall thickening.
The patient was started on flagyl for a 2 week course, c diff samples x 3 were sent and are all negative.
His mental status has improved over the course of the hospitalization, however evaluation by physical therapy determined need for rehab placement, as well as need for continuing TPN and increased monitoring needs.
He ambulates with assistive device and has had return of bowel function.
