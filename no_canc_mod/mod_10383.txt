Admission Date:  [**2150-12-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-1-23**]   Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**] Chief Complaint: Asymptomatic with Aortic Aneurysm  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2150-12-30**] Endovascular Stenting of Ascending and Aortic Arch w/ Debranching and Re-anastomosis of Right Innominate and Left Carotid Arteries  History of Present Illness: 85 y/o male s/p thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair in [**2144**].
He was followed over the years with serial CT scans for known infrarenal AAA and dilated Asc.
Recent CT scan revealed an increasing aneurysm from 6.7 to 7.8 involving the distal ascending and aortic arch.
Past Medical History: - Hypertension - Aortic pathology - aneurysm ascending aorta, infrarenal AAA (3.9 X 4.5 cm), s/p thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair ([**8-/2144**]) - CRI : recent left ureteral stone with mild hydronephrosis - Prostate CA s/p radiation - Diverticulosis - Amputation R toe: several months ago secondary to infection - Bilateral Knee Replacement  Social History: The patient currently lives alone as his wife is in Rehab.
Family History: Denies any premature CAD  Physical Exam: VS: 55 12 R155/70 L161/70 6'1" 99.8kg General: Well-appearing man in NAD Skin: W/D and unremarkable HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, OP Benign Neck: Supple, FROM, -JVD, -Bruits Chest: CTAB -w/r/r Heart: RRR +3/6 systolic murmur Abd: Soft, Non-distended, Non-tender, +BS Ext: Warm, well-perfused, -edema, -varicosities, 2+ pulses throughout Neuro: Non-focal, MAE, A&O x 3  Pertinent Results: [**2151-1-4**] Chest MRI/MRA: 1.
Markedly suboptimal examination due to patient and technical factors.
Occluded left internal jugular vein.
Thoracic aortic endograft in situ.
There is cardiomegaly with LV predominance and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
There is widening of the superior mediastinum, unchanged since the prior film of [**2151-1-3**].
There is opacity at the left base medially obscuring the left hemidiaphragm likely due to atelectasis/consolidation in the left lower lobe and there is a probable small left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
[**2150-12-31**] Head CT: There are bilateral hypodensities in the cerebellar hemispheres and bilaterally in the occipital lobes.
These all to be of similar age, and are most suggestive of severe posterior circulation ischemia with infarction.
The cerebellar infarcts demonstrate minimal mass effect at this time, but should be followed for later swelling and posterior fossa mass effect.
There is a mass along the left optic nerve that appears focally expanded at the orbital apex.
There may be a continuation of this mass in the left cavernous sinus.
These findings are most suggestive of a meningioma, but other lesions, such as lymphoma, sarcoid, and optic nerve glioma, should be considered.
There is left posterior parietal and right anterior parietal and temporal scalp swelling.
[**2150-12-30**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic arch is markedly dilated with a maximum diameter of 6.2 cm..
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with an immobile non-coronary cusp.
There is aortic sclerosis with an aortic valve area of 1.8cm2 and Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Mild AI and TR.
Immedialtely post bypass, there is a mobile echodensity seen in the ascending aorta and arch giving an impression of double barrel aorta with flows in both lumens.
This is consistent with retrograde filling of aneurysm sac from left subclavian artery or an endoleak.
At the end of the surgery, following additional stent placement, this filling resolved completely with no residual endoleak visualized.
Small infrarenal AAA measuring 4.2 x 3.8 cm as described above.
No evidence of critical stenosis in the aorta or iliac arteries.
Single vessel runoff to the foot through the right posterior tibial artery which supplies a widely patent DP through a collateral and diminuitive plantar arteries.
On the following day he was brought to the operating room where he underwent Endovascular Stenting of Ascending and Aortic Arch w/ Debranching and Re-anastomosis of Right Innominate and Left Carotid Arteries.
CT revealed a severe posterior circulation infarction.
The consulting neurologist believed that there was a very low likelyhood of recovery of any significant neurologic function.
Due to the poor prognosis, and lack of improvement in neurologic function, the family requested that he be made a DNR, and that dialysis be stopped on [**2151-1-22**].
