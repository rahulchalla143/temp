No other interval change can be seen on the chest examination in comparison with the supine image of [**2167-8-1**].
Page was placed at 3:40 p.m.   KUB [**2167-8-2**]: There is scattered air within non-dilated loops of small and large bowel with no air-fluid levels on the semi-erect study to suggest bowel obstruction.
There are degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.A dynamic hip screw is partially visualized with in the right femoral neck and head.
If the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging should be considered.
CXR [**8-1**]: Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and asymmetrical perihilar and basilar opacities, left greater than right.
Although potentially due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema, infection is an additional consideration given clinical history of fever.
Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for more complete evaluation when the patient's condition allows.
There is retrocardiac/left lower lobe hazy opacity which may represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
Minimal patchy opacity also seen at the right lung base, but the assessment is limited due to relative [**Name (NI) 76419**]/technique.
CONCLUSION:  Possible bilateral lower lobe atelectasis/pneumonia.
CXR [**7-29**]:Vagal nerve stimulator projects over the left chest wall.
Severe scoliosis results in suboptimal evaluation of the chest due to rotated appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
There is no definite consolidation, large effusion, or pneumothorax.
No overt pulmonary edema.
CXR EKG: SR at ~80bpm with episodes of bigeminy on rhythm strip  EKG [**2167-8-1**] pm: afib w/ RVR to ~130bpm (converted to sinus)  TTE [**2167-8-4**]:The left atrium is normal in size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: []BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY: In brief this is a 61yoF with h/o developmental delay and epilepsy who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-29**] after falling.
She was found to have right femoral fracture and was taken to OR on [**7-30**].
On [**8-1**], patient went into atrial fibrillation with HRs in 130s.
Patient also noted to have poor access; however, 2 peripheral IVs (a 20 and a 22) were placed.
MICU course- In the MICU patient had poor IV access and received a PICC line for access and to receive treatment for her pneumonia.
She was transferred to the MICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and concern for hypoxia.
An echo performed on [**2167-8-4**] showed no evidence of valvular dysfunction or left atrial enlargement.
[]ACTIVE ISSUES: #Tachycardia with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate (Afib with RVR): On [**2167-8-1**], pt had afib with RVR at 145bpm and converted spontaneously to sinus rythm with bigeminy.
Pt had recurrent episodes of Afib with RVR on tele and converted to sinus spontaneously each time.
She maintained good blood pressures despite this tachycardia and had no chest pain.
She was monitored on telemetry and had no documented events during her stay on the medicine floor after being discharge from the MICU.
#Aspiration Pneumonia: Most likely pneumonia secondary to peri-extubation aspiration.
had evdience of opacities on chest xray.
While in the MICU she received IV vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl for hospital aquired pneumonia coverage and aspiration pneumonia coverage.
# Elevated Creatinine Kinase: This was thought to be secondary to her open reduction and internal fixation.
# Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of the right femur: Orthopedic surgery followed pt post-operatively for wound checks.
Her pain was well controlled, and no signs of infection were noted.
Ondansetron 4 mg PO Q8H:PRN nausea   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Academy Manor of [**Location (un) 7658**] - [**Location (un) 7658**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Femur fracture Secondary: Fever, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted because of a fracture of your femur bone.
You underwent surgery to repair this and the surgery was complicated by fevers and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
You were transferred to the medicine service for management of fever and you received antibiotics.
You were noted to have an irregular rhythm and were given medicine to slow your heart rate, which worked well.
