There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
[**2106-4-5**] Renal US: The right kidney measures 11.4 cm and the left kidney measures 12.2 cm.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or renal calculi bilaterally.
Both kidneys display diffusely increased echogenic renal parenchyma.
Limited evaluation of the urinary bladder is unremarkable.
Incidentally noted is a large left pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis or renal calculi bilaterally.
Diffusely increased echogenicity of the renal parenchyma is consistent with underlying medical renal disease.
Worsening left pleural effusion; moderate-to-severe with associated worsening left lower lobe atelectasis.
Prior lung intervention with an associated stable peripheral opacity in the right upper lung.
Cytology: [**4-6**] Pleural fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Mesothelial cells, histiocytes and abundant blood.
On admission, he had a chest xray with small left pleural effusion left lower lobe opacity concerning for pneumonia.
On [**3-14**] he had increasing shortness of breath, +accessory muscle use and tachypnea.
An ABG showed respiratory acidosis with a PCO2 of 65 and he was transferred to the ICU for further management of respiratory distress.
He was intubated after transfer to the ICU for progressive respiratory distress with improvement of his ABG.
He was started on a bicarbonate infusion [**3-15**] secondary to persistently low HC03 levels and given PO bicarb tabs.
Nephrology was consulted on [**3-16**] for increasing creatinine (BUN 83/Cr 4.0) and metabolic acidosis and he was felt to have acute on chronic renal failure.
His bicarb level improved, however he continued to have difficulty pressure support, with hypercarbia and acidosis after attempting to decrease vent settings.
He was also started on nephramine TPN for renal failure in addition to his tube feeds which were decreased for a total protein intake of 40-50g daily.
He continued to have agitation/delirium at night, haldol and xanax were tried for treamtent.
He was found to have an increased TSH level and his levothyroxine dose was increased.
On [**3-24**], he was found to be c. diff positive and was started on flagyl for a 14 day course.
His urine output trended down and he was making minimal urine at the time of discharge.
He was continued on pressure support with slow wean of pressure support attempted with continued failure due to hypercarbia.
On [**3-29**] he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
An echo was done [**4-1**] which showed a dilated left atrium, LVEF>55% and LVH.
Psychiatry was consulted on [**3-30**] for concerns of depression, suicidal gestures and night time agitation.
Blood cultures were no growth, however sputum cultures from [**3-30**] grew pseudomonas on [**4-1**].
Pulmonology was consulted on [**4-2**] at the request of the family, and it was felt that he had multi-focal respiratory failure secondary to pseudomonas VAP, muscle weakness and the left pleural effusion causing a restrictive ventilatory defect.
They recommended to do a thoracentesis of the left lung effusion, which was performed on [**4-6**] with 1.5L of bloodly pleural fluid drained.
Cultures were negative and cytology showed no malignant cells.
He continued to have periods of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus.
His nephramine was stopped on [**4-9**] secondary to increasing left effusion and concern for high fluid intake involvement in its reaccumulation.
His portable chest x-ray at time of discharge showed start of re-accumulation of his left sided effusion.
