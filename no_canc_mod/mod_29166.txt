This pregnancy was complicated by findings on ultrasound at 17 weeks of bilateral hydronephrosis with echogenic renal parenchyma, dilated ureters, 2-vessel umbilical cord and a distended bladder with ureterocele.
Cystic changes within the kidneys were also seen on some scans.
The patient was followed closely with serial ultrasounds and was also seen by antenatal fetal continuing care center at [**Hospital3 1810**] including Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 61096**], of urology and the genetic service.
Differential diagnosis included a primary kidney dysplastic disorder, reflux, obstruction from ureterocele and posterior ureteral valves.
Follow up ultrasound initially showed improvement of the hydronephrosis with normal amniotic fluid volume although the kidneys remained echogenic and the bladder dilated with persistent ureterocele.
More notable cystic changes of right kidney and inability to visualize the left kidney.
Moderate bleeding was noted due to position of the placenta.
The infant emerged with moderate tone and weak cry, initially very pale but responded quickly to stimulation and positive pressure ventilation.
Active premature infant in moderate respiratory distress at rest.
Chest moderately aerated.
Moderate grunting, flaring, retracting.
No murmur or gallops.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  RESPIRATORY:  Infant was admitted to the newborn intensive care unit and placed on CPAP with progressive respiratory distress.
He received a total of 2 doses of surfactant for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome and he currently is on SIMV of 20, PIP of 20, PEEP of 5, requiring anywhere from 21 to 30% oxygen.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Infant was evaluated by cardiology secondary to a murmur.
Cardiology was unable to assess the murmur as it was no longer audible.
GASTROINTESTINAL: The infant was noted on [**12-8**], around 9 p.m. to have a full distended abdomen.
KUB was obtained demonstrating dilated bowel loops.
[**Last Name (un) 37079**] was placed to air ventilation, otherwise no GI issues.
GENITOURINARY:  Prenatal diagnosis including cystic kidneys, distended bladder, dilated ureters, echogenic renal parenchyma, bilateral ureterocele.
Findings include bilateral renal cystic dysplasia, both kidneys containing numerous small cysts.
There is also dilated right ureter which appears to subtend the upper pole of the right kidney.
Left kidney measures 3.3 cm and has small cysts.
There is a large hydroureter, most likely comes from the left upper pole of the left kidney.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Premature male born at 33 and 6/7 weeks with respiratory distress syndrome.
Multiple renal anomalies including bilateral cystic renal dysplasia, bilateral dilated ureters, large left ureterocele.
Rule out sepsis with antibiotics.
