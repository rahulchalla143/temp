Between the time of the call and the arrival of EMS, the patient developed a left gaze preference and right hemipareis.
At the time of arrival in the ED, the patient's exam was consistent with an NIH stroke scale score of about 19 (2 for inability to answer loc questions, 2 for inability to follow loc commands, 1 for partial gaze palsy/left gaze preference, 1 for partial hemianopia, 2 for right facial palsy, 4 for left upper extremity plegia, 3 for no effort versus gravity in left lower extremity, 2 for severe aphasia, 2 for profound inattention to right side of space).
Past Medical History: - HTN - DM   Social History: - Ethiopian - widowed - lives with son   Family History: - negative for stroke, seizure  Physical Exam: General: Awake.
HEENT: Normocepahlic, atruamatic, no scleral icterus noted.
No carotid bruits appreciated.
Skin: no rashes or concerning lesions noted.

There is also hypodensity and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the left MCA territory.
There is no evidence of an intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or shift of normal midline structures.
There is no lytic or sclerotic bony lesion.
CT PERFUSION: There is increased mean transit time in the left MCA territory with a decreased blood volume as well as decreased blood flow consistent with acute infarction in the left MCA territory.
There is no evidence of significant penumbra.
CT brain [**2177-1-11**]: FINDINGS: Similar large left MCA territory infarct with significant mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and stable subfalcine herniation.
There are punctate foci of hyperdensity similar to prior, likely small foci of hemorrhage along the infarct.
There is no fracture.
Similar appearance of large left MCA territory infarct.
Similar subfalcine herniation and 11 mm rightward shift of midline structures.
Similar significant mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
Several similar punctate foci of hyperdensity likely foci of hemorrhage   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 71524**] was admitted as a transfer from [**Hospital6 2561**] for care after a CTA showed an occlusion of the left M1 MCA.
On examination she had a left gaze deviation, dense right hemiplegia and was globally aphasic.
On HD 2, follow-up CTs revealed increasing edema in the left hemisphere and she was initiated on hypertonic saline (w/ goal Na 150-155).
Telemetry revealed that the patient was in Atrial Fibrillation, which is the likely source of her ischemic stroke.
Successive CT brain scans showed increased edema of the left MCA infarct and increased subfalcine herniation to the right.
There was also left uncal herniation.
Neurosurgery was consulted for a possible left hemicraniectomy, but it felt that there was no surgical indication.
