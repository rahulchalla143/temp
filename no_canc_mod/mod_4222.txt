Admission Date:  [**2192-10-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2192-10-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2128-12-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 22591**] is a 63-year-old gentleman, with a history of rheumatic heart disease, who has had moderate known mitral stenosis which had become progressively worse with symptoms over the past several months.
He had a cardiac echo done on [**2192-6-13**] which showed a markedly dilated left atrium, ejection fraction of 55%, moderately dilated aortic root, and severely thickened and deformed aortic valve leaflets.
There was noted to be severe aortic valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets were moderately thickened with severe mitral annular calcification.
Also, in comparison to a previous study in [**2191-8-15**], there was noted to be worsened aortic stenosis with a peak aortic valve gradient of 79 mmHg, with a mean aortic valve gradient of 54 mmHg, and an aortic valve area of 0.7.
The patient noted that his dyspnea on exertion over the past 6-8 months had been getting worse, and he denies any episodes of syncope, presyncope, or chest pain.
He had recently prior to admission had a work-up for anemia, including a bone marrow biopsy, which revealed an anemia consistent with his HIV infection, and iron deficiency due to hemolysis from damaged cells across the aortic valve.
Aortic stenosis.
ALLERGIES:  He has No known drug allergies.
NECK:  Supple with mild JVD and no bruits.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm with a [**Known lastname 1105**]/VI systolic ejection murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly, and positive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Show no varicosities, and he has weak pulses bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2192-10-11**], the patient underwent coronary angiography which showed elevated right and left heart filling pressures with severe pulmonary hypertension, severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.7 cm2, and mitral stenosis with a mitral valve area of 1 cm2.
He had 1+ mitral regurgitation, and ejection fraction of approximately 50%.
His coronary arteries showed his left main to have mild disease, his left anterior descending artery with a 50% stenosis after the second diagonal, and the second diagonal had an ulcerated 70% stenosis.
His left circumflex had 90% stenosis in large OM1, and the right coronary has 70% stenosis at the ostial PDA.
Following the results of this catheterization, a consult was called to cardiothoracic surgery service for possible coronary artery bypass grafting with replacement of aortic and mitral valves.
He also had aortic valve replacement with a #19 mm bovine pericardial valve, and a mitral valve replacement with a #27 [**Company 1543**] mosaic porcine valve.
Upon arrival in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was noted to be hypoxic with respiratory acidosis requiring Ambu and 100% FIO2 in order to achieve an SPO2 of greater than 90%.
Consequently, he underwent a bedside bronchoscopy, for which he had minimal secretions, but a thick white plug was suctioned.
Following this, his respiratory acidosis did improve.
On the evening of postoperative day #5, he went into a rapid atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response rate in the 150s.
His extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
His discharge chest x-ray shows a very small sliver of a right apical pneumothorax which has been stable for several days.
