There is a small focus of hemorrhage in the anterior right frontal lobe and there is subarachnoid blood, most pronounced in the superior anterior aspect of the right frontal region.
There is also subarachnoid blood in the right quadrigeminal plate cistern and a trace amount of blood is present in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
Additional small areas of contusion are identified along the lateral surface of the posterior right temporal lobe.
At this time, there is no shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
A tiny focus of increased density is noted in the superior septum pellucidum, perhaps a hemorrhage in the corpus callosum.
No skull fractures are identified.
CT Cspine- No evidence of cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
No evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
Multiple hypodense liver lesions, the largest consistent with a cyst, the smaller of which are too small to characterize.
Multiple small hypodense left kidney lesions, too small to characterize, possibly representing cysts.
Rpt hd CT- Overall similar appearance of multiple foci of subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages in the brain, related to a recent trauma.
The right frontal lobe focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage, that is more inferior, slightly more prominent, and there are two tiny foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage adjacent to the falx which were not so apparent previously.
2nd Rpt Hd CT- Grossly unchanged multiple intracranial hemorrhages as described above.
No evidence of portal vein thrombosis.
Multiple thin-walled hepatic cysts as described above.
No evidence of focal hepatic mass or intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
XR L Hip- Healed left hip fracture, osteoarthritis of left hip, intact internal fixation hardware, osteopenia.
