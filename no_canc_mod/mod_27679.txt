Admission Date:  [**2171-11-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-11-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-8-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**] Chief Complaint: subdural hematoma/ subarachnoid hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 79F with a h/o hypercholesterolemia who presented to an OSH after an unwitnessed fall on [**11-18**] and was found to have a 7mm left sided SDH and SAH on CT. She does not remember the fall, and was found by a neighbor who reported she was unconscious at first but then arousable.
She denies any CP, SOB, dizziness, tongue biting, incontinence, weakness/ motor deficits, sensory deficits, and change in speech or vision before or after the time of fall.
The patient was very confused upon arousal and reports a severe throbbing HA and neck pain with flexion after the fall.
She denies any other recent falls.
The patient was transferred from the OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-18**] where CT showed a 5mm left-sided subdural hematoma (possibly acute on chronic) and a small L temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage with no evidence of acute infarct.
The patient was admitted to the trauma ICU for frequent neurochecks, where she was started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
Previous documentation notes word finding problems for the last 1 and [**1-22**] years that were attributed to Zoloft, but the patient's daughter notes that these symptoms are far more pronounced than usual.
Past Medical History: Hypercholesterolemia Depression Question early dementia - recent forgetfulness Hypothyroidism treated with Synthroid The patient also reports a cardiac catheterization at the [**Hospital1 112**] 6yrs ago which was normal.
She also had a normal carotid ultrasound about 2 yrs ago after her sister was diagnosed with a carotid stenosis.
Family History: father CAD, MI at age 66yrs, sister with carotid stenosis at age 76  Physical Exam: VS: Tc/m 101.4  BP 122/70 (118-136/60-72)  HR 86 (74-86)  RR 18 O2sat 97%RA (93-97%RA) Gen: pleasant elderly female sitting in chair in NAD.
Conjunctiva pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Very mild systolic [**1-26**] murmur best over RUSB.
No r/g/ thrills.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No suprapubic tenderness.
2+ distal pulses Skin: stasis dermatitis, no ulcers or scars.
Patient can name days of week and months of year backwards without difficulty.
+ occasional word finding difficulties.
[**11-18**] CT head: Left-sided suboccipital subdural hematoma about 5mm in greatest thickness.
Small L temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No evidence of acute infarct.
[**11-19**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Unchanged L convexity subdural hematoma and small subarachnoid hemorrhage .
The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there is some tortuosity of the aorta.
However, no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute pneumonia.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
No structural cardiac cause of syncope identified.
Unchanged subdural hematoma along the left convexity, left anterior falx and left tentorium.
Probable evolving contusion in the left posterior/inferior temporal lobe.
The planned brain MRI will be helpful for further evaluation.
Left temporal abnormality visualized on the recent CT consistent with hemorrhagic contusion and not with recent infarction.
Irregularity of the left posterior cerebral artery may be due to trauma from impact onto the nearby tentorium or alternatively could relate to intrinsic arterial disease such as atherosclerosis.
Given the lack of evident arterial disease elsewhere, in context, the former seems more likely.
Small multifocal subdural hematomas, probably unchanged, allowing for differences in technique between CT and MR. 4.
Old lacunar infarct in the left caudate.
No evidence of stenosis or occlusion seen.
[**11-24**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to intermittent bursts of focal slowing arising in the left temporal and left fronto-temporal regions suggesting a region of subcortical dysfunction in that area.
Vascular disease would be among the common causes for such a finding.
There were no epileptiform features.
No electrographic seizures were noted.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  79 yo with hypercholesterolemia and depression who presents after an unwitnessed fall possibly secondary to a syncopal episode with subsequent SDH/SAH.
The patient's daughter expressed concern that existing word-finding difficulties had worsened from her baseline, and during admission the patient complained of intermittent episodes of emesis and headaches.
An MRI was performed, with findings consistent with hemorrhagic concussion and surrounding edema.
Neurology was consulted and felt that symptoms were consistent with a post-concussive syndrome.
Dilantin was tapered off prior to discharge with no evidence of seizures during admission.
The patient denies any preceding symptoms consistent with mechanical fall, vasovagal event, or orthostatis; however, details are unclear.
The patient was ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes negative x 3 with no concerning EKG changes for ischemia.
The patient has a very mild systolic heart murmur on exam with no history of syncope, chest pain or dyspnea suggestive of severe valvular disease.
Echo showed normal heart function and no evidence of valvular stenosis.
Carotid US and MRA of the neck were without significant stenosis on both sides.
EEG was negative for epileptiform foci.
The patient was ambulating well with no symptoms of orthostasis during admission.
Circumstances surrounding fall still remain unclear, but syncope workup was negative with no further evidence of syncope.
# Fever: During the admission the patient spiked a temperature to 101.4 with no leukocytosis and no localizing symptoms.
Urinalysis was negative but cultures were positive for 10-100K enterococcus without urinary symptoms.
The possibility of drug fevers was entertained given new addition of dilantin, but this was felt to be unlikely per neurology.
The patient was started on a 7 day course of ampicillin for UTI and was afebrile by the time of discharge.
# Possible dementia: The patient was evaluated by neurology and was found to have evidence of word-finding difficulties intermittently during admission.
Symptoms were felt by the primary medical team and neurology consult service to be consistent with sundowning and/or post-concussive syndrome.
Patient also exhibited evidence of early mild-cognitive impairment, given word-finding difficulties and finger apraxia on exam which may be more pronounced after recent head trauma.
However, these symptoms could also be secondary to edema surrounding contusion in left temporal lobe on CT. Metabolic/ infectious workup was negative, with negative RPR and TSH, B12, and folate within normal limits.
# CVS/Hyperlipidemia: The patient has no cardiac history by recent cath.
During admission the patient was continued on Simvastatin and Zetia with ASA held, as above, for SDH/SAH.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] vna  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: L sided subdural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage, post-concussive syndrome Secondary: Hypercholesterolemia Depression Hypothyroidism treated with Synthroid   Discharge Condition: Neurologically stable with resolution of headaches.

Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after sustaining head trauma from a fall.
No clear cause for the fall was found.
You were found to have a small amount of bleeding called a subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage on admission.
You were also diagnosed with a urinary tract infection for which you should complete a course of ampicillin.
