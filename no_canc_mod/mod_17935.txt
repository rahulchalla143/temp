Admission Date:  [**2201-1-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2201-1-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2174-9-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**] Chief Complaint: Pyelonephritis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This 26 year old female with no known past medical history presents with 1 week history of left flank [**Last Name (un) 103**] pain as well as n&v.
She admits to dysuria symptoms and has been having fevers since saturday.
Patient also noted neck stiffness with headache but denies any photophobia.
On arrival to the ER patient had fever to 103.
Her urine was -ve for UTI but CT abdomen demonstrated multiple wedge-shaped/rounded areas of hypo-attenuation within a  mildly enlarged left kidney consistent with pyelonephritis/lobar nephronia.
Patient also underwent LP which was negative for meningitis.
pregnancy test negative, works as trainer at Clinique  Family History: Diabetes  Physical Exam: temp 97.4, 106/66, 63, 20, 95 General: NAD Neck: supple, no jvd, no nodes.
CVS: rrr, nl s1+s2, no m/r/g.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
CT CHEST: 1) Bilateral lower lobe predominant dependent areas of consolidation accompanied by ground glass attenuation and small centrilobular opacities.
Constellation of findings is most consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
Differential diagnosis includes dependent distribution of hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
2) Small dependent bilateral pleural effusions.
CT ABD: IMPRESSION: Multiple rounded or slightly wedge-shaped areas of mixed hypoattenuation within a slightly enlarged left kidney, in this context, strongly suggestive of acute focal bacteria nephritis (old term "acute lobar nephronia").
These lesions may represent an early stage of in situ abscess formation, and should be correlated with clinical and laboratory data.
Acute renal infarction would be another, more distant consideration   Brief Hospital Course: Pt placed on IV ciprofloxacin.
After arrival on the floor, patient became markedly ill, with fevers to 105.5, severe vomitting and hypoxia to the 80's.
Due to her hypoxia a chest x-ray was obtained which was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.
Given the suspicion of sepsis, this was concerning for ARDS or interstitial pneumonia from sepsis.
A repeat chest x-ray showed pulmonary effusions, so a non-contrast high-res CT was obtained to evaluate the lungs, which demonstrated a superimposed bilateral severe aspiration pneumonia.
On review of imaging there is some suspicion by GU that there may have been a stone signified by a filling defect on the original CT, likely passed.
