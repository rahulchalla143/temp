There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
A fractured uppermost sternal wire is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
CXR AP [**2139-7-17**] (S/p line placement: FINDINGS: There is a new right IJ line with the tip in the lower SVC.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
TTE [**2139-7-18**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-11-20**], no change.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 64M with numerous cardiac risk factors and known CAD presents with complaint of dyspnea with bradycardia and hypotension and is found to be in complete AV dissociation.
Active Issues: # RHYTHM: Patient has no known prior cardiac arrhythmias.
Cardiac enzymes were reassuring for no acute ischemia.
It was felt that block most likely occured [**1-14**] addition of verapamil to current regimen (although there was not evidence of CCB toxicity on admission.)
He was evaluated by EP felt AV dissociation did not represent true complete heart block.
On discharge EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with AV conduction delay.
# CAD:  Patient has known CAD with CABG x5 in [**11-18**].
EKG and cardiac enzymes showed no e/o active ischemia.
# Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive on presentation with minimal response to IVF resuscitation.
All anti-hypertensive meds were intially held due to hypotension and AV block.
On discharge, he was advised to continue to hold lisinopril due to elevated K+ (5.2) and to follow up with his PCP regarding BP control and monitoring of electolytes.
Transitional Issues: -Patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization -Avoid AV nodal blocking agents -Pt advised to hold lisinopril given elevated K+ (5.2) and f/u with PCP re BP control  Medications on Admission: 1.
AV dissociation and junctional tachycardia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath which was thought to be abnormal heart rhythm caused by a medication called VERAPAMIL that you started recently.
Your abnormal heart rhythm resolved over the course of your hospital stay.
FOLLOWING MEDICATION CHANGES WERE MADE TO YOUR MEDICATION REGIMEN STOP VERAPAMIL STOP METOPROLOL SUCCINATE 25 mg by mouth daily to prevent reoccurence of abnormal heart rhythm CONTINUE TO HOLD LISINOPRIL until you see your primary care physician as you have high potassium level which is likely a consequence of your chronic kidney disease and would benefit also from bicarbonate repletion  Followup Instructions: Please schedule an appointment with your primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 7 days .
