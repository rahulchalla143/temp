Admission Date:  [**2106-2-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-2-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2044-3-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Demerol / Ativan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**] Chief Complaint: Severe ischemia of lower extremities/ s/p R. ilio-femoral and femoral-femoral bypass graft.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thrombectomy of right iliofemoral graft, femoral-femoral graft, patch angioplasty of right femoral artery and left femoral artery with saphenous vein.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 60M with history of right sided stage III laryngeal cancer diagnosed in [**2099**] and treated with chemotherapy (adjuvant taxol and cisplatin followed by taxol, cisplatin and etoposide for three total cycles) and radiation (62g to right neck and vocal cords).
He was last admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2105-6-29**] with disabling claudication and rest pain in his bilateral lower extremities.
There is interval worsening of bilateral perihilar and basilar opacities, consistent with increasing congestive heart failure.
There are persistent opacities in the right and left upper lobe, consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.
Worsening congestive heart failure.
Unchanged right and left upper lobe pneumonia versus aspiration.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2106-2-15**] 4:20 PM  CHEST CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Emphysema is again noted, with multiple bullae in the middle and upper lobes.
There are confluent ground-glass opacities as well as interlobular septal thickening in both upper lobes, right middle lobe, lingula, and the superior and anterior portions of the lower lobes.
Small peripheral centrilobular ground-glass opacities are present throughout both lower lobes, similar in appearance to [**2104-7-16**].
While the centrilobular and confluent ground glass opacities are consistent with aspiration or pneumonia, presence of interstitial septal thickening also suggest pulmonary edema.
While there is some nodularity within the opacities, nodular opacities that were seen in the left upper and right lower lobes on [**2105-7-16**] are no longer present.
There is no evidence of an abscess.
The trachea, right and left main stem bronchi are mildly dilated.
Mild-to- moderate bronchiectasis is noted in the upper lobes, right middle lobe and lingula.
There are numerous enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, increased in number and size compared to [**2104-7-16**].
The largest right superior mediastinal node measures 12 mm in short axis diameter.
Numerous subcentimeter nodes are present in both hila.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Scattered atherosclerotic calcifications are present in the thoracic aorta.
Mural thrombus is noted in the proximal abdominal aorta.
There is an unchanged ill-defined hypodensity in the right lobe of the thyroid gland, measuring approximately 2 x 1 cm.
There is an approximately 4 cm hypodense lesion in the lower pole of the spleen, unchanged compared to the [**2106-2-13**] abdominal CT, which may represent a splenic infarction.
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, confluent in the upper and middle lobes, consistent with aspiration or pneumonia.
Recurrent interlobular septal thickening is consistent with superimposed pulmonary edema.
No evidence of an abscess.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Mild central tracheal dilatation.
Diffuse mild-to-moderate bronchiectasis in the upper and middle lobes.
However, metastatic disease cannot be excluded, and follow-up after treatment is recommended.
Hypodense splenic lesion, unchanged since [**2106-2-13**], compatible with an infarct.
Unchanged hypodense lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid.
Right bundle-branch block.
Compared to tracing #1, no diagnostic change.
[**2106-2-13**] 3:20 PM  CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: Hazy nodular opacities about the airways within the lower lungs have increased since the prior study consistent with small airways disease.
There is mild hazy opacity within the lung bases which could represent normal lung at expiration, however mild ground glass airspace disease cannot be excluded.
There is a hepatic granuloma within the dome of the liver.
No concerning hepatic lesions.
There are multiple small gallstones dependently within the gallbladder.
No gallbladder wall thickening.
No biliary ductal dilatation or choledocholithiasis evident.
Within the inferior aspect of the spleen, there is a large hypodense lesion, without enhancement measuring 4.4 x 4.3 x 3.9 cm that has significantly increased since the [**5-7**] study.
There is an adjacent smaller similar- appearing lesion lateral to this larger lesion.
There is no stranding around these lesions, however infection of the lesions cannot be excluded.
Small splenic hemangioma is also again noted unchanged.
The patient has undergone gastric bypass with a gastrojejunostomy.
No bowel wall thickening.
No evidence of bowel wall thickening or bowel obstruction.
No evidence for appendicitis.
Small amount of fluid within the right lower quadrant is nonspecific.
These areas have heterogeneous enhancement still on nephrographic phase.
There is no persistent staining on the delayed images, nor is there contrast within the kidneys on the pre- contrast CT remaining from [**2106-2-11**] angiogram.
These findings are nonspecific but considerations would include embolic phenomenon such as cholesterol or other emboli.
Of note, there is a large calcified plaque within the right renal artery just beyond its origin with at least moderate narrowing of the right renal artery.
There is also moderate narrowing of the left renal artery at its origin.
There are multiple cysts within the kidneys bilaterally.
There are multiple hypoattenuating lesions which are too small to characterize but likely cysts.
No lymphadenopathy or ascites.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder has a Foley catheter within it and is incompletely distended.
No definite urinary bladder abnormality.
There is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
There is a rectal tube with balloon inflated within the rectum.
Subsequent administration of rectal contrast shows no leakage of contrast and no other abnormality.
CT ARTERIOGRAM WITH IV CONTRAST: There is diffuse atherosclerotic plaque within the aorta with a large amount of plaque within the infrarenal aorta.
There is an ulcerated plaque within the infrarenal aorta with a small neck.
There is reconstitution of the left external iliac artery from retrograde flow and there is minimal flow within the left internal iliac artery.
The right common iliac artery is patent at its origin and then there is a bypass graft from the right common iliac artery to the right common femoral artery.
This is just superior to an excluded partially thrombosed old femoral- femoral bypass graft which contains gas within it, likely from recent surgery.
There are small fluid collections about bilateral common femoral arteries near the graft origin/insertions, both of which contain small amounts of gas, likely related to recent surgery.
Just distal to the insertion site of the femoral-femoral bypass graft on the left is a round fluid collection that on pre-contrast images is heterogeneous in density and post-contrast images shows a small amount of contrast outside the lumen of the adjacent arteries with progressive increased density dependently within the collection seen, making this highly suspicious for a pseudoaneurysm.
SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**], and celiac artery are all patent and without evidence of proximal stenoses.
As mentioned above, the right renal artery has a large calcified plaque just beyond its origin with at least moderate stenosis.
The left renal artery has moderate stenosis at its origin.
BONE WINDOWS: There is multilevel lumbar disc degeneration.
No suspicious bone lesions.
Aortic atherosclerosis with ulcerated plaque in the infrarenal aorta.
Occluded left common iliac artery with external iliac artery reconstitution from retrograde flow from fem-fem bypass graft.
Increased size of hypodense splenic lesions that could represent infarcts.
Patent SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] without evidence of bowel abnormality.
Bilateral patchy heterogeneous perfusion abnormalities within the kidneys suggesting recent bilateral renal insult, possibly from embolic phenomenon such as cholesterol emboli.
There is also bilateral renal artery stenosis, slightly worse on the right than the left, at least a moderate degree.

?re wound / incision site and this should be left in place for three (3) days.
?re wound / incision site and this should be left in place for three (3) days.
Limit strenuous activity  and or heavy lifting until the wound is well healed.
Activity may prevent the wound from healing.
Try to keep your affected limb elevated when not in use, This decreases swelling to the affected wound and helps in the healing process.
Be sure you take the full course even if the wound looks well healed.
