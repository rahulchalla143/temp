There is mixed high-density material within this region that could represent postoperative ethmoid hematoma.
There is bifrontal craniotomy and subsequent cranioplasty.
Due to artifact from the postoperative mesh it is unclear as to what amount of residual mass is present.
There are no acute major vascular territorial infarcts and the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter differentiation is well preserved.
There is no significant midline shift.
IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes from resection of the expansile lesion centered in the posterior ethmoid air cells with associated hematoma in the paranasal air sinuses and ethmoid air cell surgical fractures.
Due to artifacts from the frontoethmoid mesh it is unclear as to how much residual lesion is still present.
Diffusion-weighted imaging was also reviewed.
A surgical mesh is unchanged in location projecting over the frontoethmoidal recess.
There is no evidence of residual ethmoidal mucocele.
Extensive paranasal sinus disease is unchanged.
Small foci of hypointensity on gradient echo sequences are indicative of a small amount of intracranial blood.
There are no abnormal foci of enhancement.
Status post resection of ethmoidal mucocele with no evidence of residual mucocele.
Extensive unchanged paranasal sinus disease.
A surgical mesh underlying the frontal lobes bilaterally, and overlying the frontoethmoidal recess is unchanged in location.
A moderate amount of pneumocephalus is noted, decreased since [**2102-3-15**].
The brain parenchyma, ventricles and sulci are all unchanged in appearance, with no evidence of shift of normally midline structures or herniation.
Extensive paranasal sinus opacification is unchanged.
A moderate amount of fluid is seen layering posteriorly in the nasopharynx.
IMPRESSION: Postoperative change as detailed above, with slight interval resolution of pneumocephalus since [**3-15**].
There is no evidence of brain parenchymal herniation.
Bifrontal extraaxial hematoma adjacent to the central craniotomy site does appear slightly increased in size from most recent examination.
No significant midline shift or mass effect is noted.
Large region of postoperative packing/hemorrhage in the expected location of the ethmoid sinuses has likely been evacuated with a more simple-appearing low- attenuation fluid within this region identified.
A small amount of hemorrhage may still persist within the remaining anterior ethmoid air cells.
There has been interval increase in degree of pneumocephalus likely related to recent procedure.
Hyperdense secretions within the left sphenoid sinus persist with opacification of the right sphenoid sinus and scattered opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells appearing stable.
Discrete degree of soft tissue swelling especially along the orbital roof bilaterally appears slightly increased from [**3-17**].
IMPRESSION: No findings to suggest intracranial herniation.
Status post new right- sided EVD with interval increase in pneumocephalus due to interval procedure.
LENIS [**3-21**]: BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Color Doppler and grayscale imaging of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins demonstrate normal compression, augmentation, waveforms and flow.
There is no evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
No CSF leak was identified at this time.
Head CT was done immediately thereafter, and no hemorrhage was present.
On the morning of [**3-29**], he was again challenged at the bedside to assess for CSF leak and there was no drainage.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every twelve (12) hours as needed for constipation.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.

New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
