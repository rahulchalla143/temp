Admission Date:  [**2126-12-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2127-1-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2055-12-2**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 95676**] TEAM  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain, cough, fever, shortness of breath x 1 day.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old male, with a history of extensive CAD status post multiple interventions, CHF with an EF of 20%, status post ICD placement, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, who presented with pneumonia and non-ST elevation MI at [**Hospital3 **], diagnosed on transfer from [**12-29**], and transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for catheterization.
At approximately 5:00 pm on [**12-29**], he had an episode of hypertension, SBP in the 200s, a heart rate of 140s with shortness of breath and satting 80% on [**2-4**] liters of oxygen, treated with Nitropaste, 10 mg IV metoprolol, lasix 40 IV, and morphine with improvement.
Then again on [**12-30**] in the morning had shortness of breath and was treated with morphine x 4 mg, Nitropaste and IV lasix.
The patient presented to outside hospital on [**12-29**] with one day of chest pain, cough, fever, shortness of breath, progressive decreased exercise tolerance x 1 month, increasing lethargy.
The patient also reports having had a light cold, mild cough, and rhinorrhea for 2 days.
Positive shaking and shivering and a sore throat with fever to 101.3.
The patient denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with stable orthopnea.
Denies chest pain or pressure at the time on transfer, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis.
No dysuria, hematuria, or changes in frequency.
CAD status post multiple interventions.
Diabetes mellitus.
Status post ICD placement secondary to syncope and V-tach in setting of an MI.
Status post MI in [**2111**].
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5-2.4.
2+ carotid pulses.
A I/VI systolic murmur on the left upper sternal border.
Positive edema bilaterally to midcalves.
No pronator drift.
Given his acute renal failure, ACE inhibitor was held, and the patient was not maintained on a IIB/III inhibitor.
Supplemental oxygen requirement was weaned in conjunction with diuresis, but likely in large part due to percutaneous coronary flow restoration.
The patient was again maintained on aspirin, Plavix, beta blocker, statin, and ACE inhibitor was held pending improvement of his acute renal failure prior to discharge.
Cardiovascular :  The patient presented with decompensated systolic heart failure.
Given his ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 20%, [**State 531**] Heart Association III baseline, improving, the patient was diuresed to a dry weight of 208 pounds.
RHYTHM:  The patient was maintained on telemetry without any events during this hospitalization.
2) ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  The patient had an ultrasound at the outside hospital which was negative for a postobstructive process.
However, while being maintained on Natrecor, his creatinine bumped again to 2.3 up to 2.5, which was likely thought to be due to overaggressive diuresis, and we decreased his lasix dose at that time.
3) DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient had reasonable fingerstick blood sugar control.
4) THRUSH:  The patient had an episode of pooled blood in his oropharynx and white exudative thrush on oral mucosa.
The patient was evaluated by the ENT service on [**2127-1-4**] who felt that the patient likely had exudative oropharynx, and the patient was treated with Hurricaine spray as needed for tenderness.
The patient was maintained on a treatment of nystatin and fluconazole x 7 days with marked improvement.
5) PNEUMONIA:  The patient was initially transferred with Tequin, and was subsequently changed over to Levaquin with renal dosing, for a total 10-day course of Levaquin with marked improvement.
He had no further episodes of cough or fevers during this hospitalization stay.
Acute myocardial infarction, subendocardial, initial episode.
Congestive heart failure, systolic and diastolic.
RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:  Please confirm your appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 16148**], scheduled for [**2127-1-15**] for location/exact time.
