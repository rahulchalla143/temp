Colonoscopy on [**12-20**] showed a colitis.
The colitis was consistent with a CMV or ischemic colitis being most likely cause of her colitis.
This colitis manifested itself as ulcers, granularity, friability and erythema and is to be the cause of her OB positive stools over the past few days.
On exam the patient had a very constricted affect and was minimally interactive.
Celexa was started for depression and this is being continued.
The patient remained npo and she was being given tube feeds through her NG tube for nutrition.
On [**2143-12-21**] the patient continued to improve with increased mobility and exercise tolerance.
There were no significant events overnight.
On [**12-23**] a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed to exclude vegetations and rule out endocarditis after her sepsis from coag positive staph.
There were minimal findings including 1+ MR, TR and aortic insufficiency on the echocardiogram.
In addition, the patient had a swallowing evaluation.
This will continue to be evaluated in ongoing basis as the patient has no underlying reason for aspiration and should, as her oral lesions from herpes resolve and she regain strain, should be able to return to a regular diet.
On [**12-23**] after the negative TTE and swallowing evaluation, it was deemed that the patient was stable and ready for placement in a short term rehab facility.
