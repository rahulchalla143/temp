History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 109949**] is a 76 year old female with worsening shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance.
Echocardiogram in [**2106-8-11**] showed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with an LVEF of 40%.
There was evidence of pulmonary hypertension with a PASP aroung 40mmHg.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease and confirmed severe mitral regurgitation.
There was mild systolic ventricular dysfunction, with an LVEF around 42%.
Past Medical History: Congestive Heart Failure Peripheral Vascular Disease Bilateral Renal Artery Stenosis - s/p Bilateral Stenting Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia History of Seizure Anemia History of Atrial Fibrillation History of Lymphoma, s/p chemotherapy - no recurrence Migraine Headaches Hysterectomy Tonsillectomy History of Sciatica  Social History: Married.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild to moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis with somewhat worse hypokinesis of the apical segment.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
Given the degree of mitral regurgitation, intrinsic left ventricular function is likely more depressed.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis with more severe apical hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild prolapse of the anterior mitral valve leaflet tip and slight retraction of the posterior leaflet.
There is moderate to severe (3+), mostly central, mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The apical segment may still be mildly hypokinetic.
No obvious focal defects.
There is a bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position.
There is trace perivalvular mitral regurgitation.
[**9-10**] CXR: Small improvement in right apical pneumothorax.
Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.
She did have a mild to moderate right-sided pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
