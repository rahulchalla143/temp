Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 4669**] Admission Date: [**2167-8-11**] Discharge Date: [**2167-8-15**] Date of Birth:  [**2091-6-8**] Sex:  M Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76-year-old man with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (status post inferior myocardial infarction with ventricular fibrillation arrest in [**2156**]) who has done well with only six episodes of exertional angina until then.
Three days ago, the patient woke up at 3:00 a.m. with severe midsternal chest pain radiating to the left arm.
It was similar to the symptoms of his prior myocardial infarction.
It was not associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or shortness of breath.
The patient presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital within one half hour of the onset of the pain where he was treated with sublingual nitroglycerin, oxygen, morphine, and heparin.
The patient became pain free and remained so for the remainder of his hospitalization.
The patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a positive troponin level of 2.87 and a creatine kinase of 426.
Cardiac catheterization performed on the day prior to admission at [**Hospital **] Hospital demonstrated a small LIMA, total occlusion of the SVG to OM,  and diseased segments of the SVG to diagonal to obtuse marginal.
The patient experienced his typical anginal symptoms during the procedure and for approximately one hour status post procedure.
The patient denied a history of shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, or presyncope.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction    times two.
Neck revealed no jugular venous distention.
A [**1-1**] apical murmur.
There was a sternotomy scar.
No hematoma or ooze.
There were no edema.
There was a left lower extremity saphenous vein graft harvest scar.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia with a rate in the 50s.
There were small Q waves and ST-T wave sloping in III and aVF.
There was a 1-mm ST segment depressions in V2 through V4.
The patient complained of persistent chest pain where he had three stents placed.
Then the patient dropped his blood pressure significantly in the SVG to first diagonal to first obtuse marginal jump graft  90's with prominent ST depressions in V1, two hepicoat stents mid and distally, one cypher in the ostium.
Post procedure, the patient developed recurrent angina with more prominent ST depressions in V1 through V4, ST elevations in I and aVL, with a decrease in blood pressures to systolics in the 90s when the nitroglycerin drip was increased.
The patient did develop a moderate retroperitoneal hematoma requiring a transfusion of blood, though this was stable.
In addition, the patient had episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia for which he will follow up with Electrophysiology for further risk stratification.
Coronary artery disease; status post non-ST-elevation    myocardial infarction with subacute stent occlusion.
The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (his    cardiologist) who will arrange for signal-averaged EKG and    exercise T wave alternate study.
