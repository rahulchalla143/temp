Poor R wave progression.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
[**9-3**]:  Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
[**9-5**]:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Imaging: CXR ([**9-1**]):  IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the lung bases which may reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
The Doppler waveform at the left popliteal artery is still triphasic with monophasic waveform at the posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis.
IMPRESSION: Moderate outflow disease on the right at the level of superficial femoral artery and posterior tibial artery and mild outflow obstruction at the level of left posterior tibial artery.
Lower extremity ultrasound ([**9-10**]):   IMPRESSION: No DVT in the right lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: 61yo M with DM, ESRD on HD, AF, sCHF (EF 30%), and hyperthyroidism who presents from rehab with nausea and poor po intake found to be in AF with RVR.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Rates to 170s initially.
He had a transient hypotension to the 90s (SBP) in the setting of rate and dilt gtt, however his pressures improved with slowing his rate.
Had an admission 2 weeks ago where hyperthyroism / thyrotoxicosis was felt to be contributing to tachycardia.
His rate control improved with treatment of thyroid disease.
Patient's T4 was initially elevated at 15.9, but decreased over 6 days to 9.7.
# Chest pain: Initially complained of chest pain in the ED, resolved by the time of ICU transfer without recurrence.
His troponin is elevated chronically in the setting of renal failure.
No ST changes noted on ECG.
No further chest pain.
His home statin was discontinued out of concern for contribution to generalized muscular pain.
# Hypoglycemia: Hypoglycemic in the ED and during the first few days of his stay, likely in the setting of poor PO intake and lantus.
# HTN: On diltiazem and lisinopril.
The dose of lisinopril was reduced due to concerns of previous episodes of hyperkalemia.
# Myalgias: Improved with ambulation, likely related to position/deconditioning.
# Hyperlipidemia: Atorvastatin held as above, consider restart as outpatient.
#Foot pain: likely multifactorial, with component of neuropathy.
# Transitional Issues - F/U with endocrinology, vascular surgery - [**Hospital1 **] T/Th/Sat - Consider restarting atorvastatin based on LDL/improvement of myalgias  Medications on Admission: [**Hospital1 **] 325mg atorvastatin 20mg lisinopril 20mg cinacalcet 30mg Senna pantoprazole 40mg daily nephrocaps daily Neurontin 300mg daily methimazole 20mg tab daily dilt 30mg 5 tabs QID albuterol 2 puffs q6 PRN/albuterol nebs PRN sevelamer 4 tabs TIS with meals benadryl 25mg 1-2 tabs q8 PRN Lantus 16 units [**Hospital1 5910**] lispro sliding scale oxycodone-acetaminophen 5/325  Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 107485**],  It was our pleasure caring for you at [**Hospital1 18**]  You were admitted for a rapid and irregular heart rate, called atrial fibrillation.
You also had been experiencing nausea and had not been eating normally.
On admission, you were found to have high thyroid levels, a hormone that regulates the body's functions.
High thyroid levels can lead to a rapid heart rate among other symptoms.
Our Endocrinology team saw you and started treatment for your high thyroid levels.
We made the following changes to your medications: STOPPED: Benadryl Percocet Atorvastatin - This medication was stopped as you were having muscle pains which is a side effect of the medicine.
If your symptoms do not improve, then we would recommend restarting this medicine after discussions with your doctors.
CHANGED DOSES - lisinopril REDUCED to 10mg daily - diltiazem INCREASED to 360mg ER daily - Lantus INCREASED to 24 units each evening - insulin sliding scale INCREASED by 3 units per level at lunch and dinner - Cinacalcet INCREASED to 90mg daily - Sevelamer INCREASED to 3200mg TID with meals  STARTED: - Tylenol 325-650mg every 6 hours as needed for pain - docusate 100mg twice a day for stool softening - lidocaine 5% patch for leg pain.
Apply for 12 hours, then off for 12 hours - prednisone 20mg daily for thyroid - Bactrim SS 1 tablet daily to prevent infection while on prednisone - Methimazole 20mg daily for hyperthyroidism  Weigh yourself every morning, call your primary care physician if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
