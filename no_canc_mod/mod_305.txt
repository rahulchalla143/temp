According to the NH records, pt had an episode of desaturation to mid 80's on RA several days ago.
As patient continued to be hypotensive and hypoxic, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**].
Pt received empiric Vancomycin, Levaquin and FLagyl for possible aspiration PNA although CXR showed no clear consolidation.
Cardiology was called, ekg was faxed: assessment - CE leak likely demand, EKG with new anteroseptal q's from [**2133**] but no clear ischemic changes currently.
Serial EKG showed no change.
Past Medical History: Schizophrenia, per NH notes, baseline AAOx1, verbally abusive Depression HTN Dementia R eye cataract CAD, sternotomy present, ?
CABG, no documentation   Social History: Unable to obtain  Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS T 97.6 BP 88/49 HR 55 RR 20 O2Sat 98 RA, negative pulsus paradoxus Gen: NAD, non-verbal, opens eyes to voice, not following commands HEENT: NC/AT, PERRLA, arcus senilis, dry mm, evidence of thrush  NECK: no LAD, no JVD, no carotid bruit COR: S1S2, regular rhythm, mildly bradycardic, [**1-3**] holosystolic murmur over apex, radiating into axilla PULM: CTA b/l, no wheezing or rhonchi ABD: + bowel sounds, soft, nd, nt Skin: cool extremities, tenting of skin, ulcer over L malleolus with necrotic tissue and surrounding edema, Stage 2 Decubitus ulcer EXT: trace DP, no edema/c/c Neuro: moving all extremities, withdrawing to pain, PERRLA, reflexes 1+, downgoing Babinsky  On discharge, the patient was afebrile.
His sacral and trocanteric decubuti were stable.
However, since the last examination, a hiatal hernia with subsequent displacement of the part of the stomach into the thorax becomes manifest.
Otherwise, there are no major changes.
The right basal parts of the lungs are slightly denser than on the previous radiograph, but without evidence of focal parenchymal consolidations.
Q waves in leads V1-V2 suggestive of prior anterior myocardial infarction.
Low limb lead voltage.
The finding limits assessment for acute fracture or subtle cortical fragmentation.
No acute injury is identified.
Assessment for the presence and/or absence of subcutaneous emphysema is limited by overlying dressing material.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls and distal inferior wall.
The apex is mildly aneurysmal and dyskinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CTA Head and Neck: IMPRESSION: No acute infarcts and no CT perfusion abnormalities.
Occlusion of the origin and proximal portion of the right vertebral artery with reconstitution within the mid cervical portion.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old male admitted to the hospital after having desaturation to the mid-80's on room air, hypotension as well decreased oral intake.
On admission, the patient was hypotensive, hypoxic with an elevated white count.
His chest x-ray on admission was negative for acute infection.
The patient received intravenous fluids for his decreased hydration as well as for his hypotension.
He also received antibiotics initially given his diarrhea and recent antibiotics course while at the nursing home as well as given his elevated white count.
He also received one dose of fluconazole for oral thrush which did not resolve with oral Nystatin.
The patient had an x-ray of his ankle to evaluate for osteomyelitis underlying his ulcer.
The xray did not appear consistent with osteomyelitis.
He also had both an EKG and echocardiogram which showed evidence that the patient had a myocardial infarction prior to his admission to the hospital.
His ECHO demonstrated normal sized left and right atrium with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There was mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum, anterior walls and distal inferior wall.
The apex is mildly aneurysmal and dyskinetic.
During his hospital course, the patient appeared less responsive with dysarthria and right sided weakness.
He had a CT scan of his head and neck vasculature, which is reported above.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 537**]- [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Shock, likely cardiogenic vs septic Chronic decubiti ulcers Thrush Secondary: Schizophrenia Depression Hypertension Coronary Artery disease   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure and low oxygen levels.
While you were in the hospital you received antibiotics for a possible pneumonia and treatment for a possible gastrointestinal infection.
Both of your antibiotics were stopped as it does not appear that your stool or lungs are infected.
It appears you had a small stroke, or TIA while you were in the hospital.
You have no residual problems from your small stroke.
It appears you may have had a heart attack prior to coming to the hospital.
