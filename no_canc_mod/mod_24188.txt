She reports her symptoms have progressed to shortness of breath [**12-14**] block, inability to climb greater than 4 stairs without stopping due to shortness of breath, and worsening fatigue.
In addition, she now reports episodes of intermittent chest pain with activity.

PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2177-7-21**] Pre implant  A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
A small secundum atrial septal defect is present.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild perivalvular aortic insufficiency seen.
There is mitral mitral regurgitation present.
There continues to be severe cardiomegaly.
The amount of pulmonary vascular redistribution and perihilar haze has increased.
Bilateral pleural effusions have increased.
Volume loss/infiltrate is increased in both lower lobes.
HgA1c:[**2179-7-27**] 08:34PM BLOOD %HbA1c-6.8* eAG-148*  [**7-27**]: LE doppler: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Course complicated by difficulty extubating and respiratory disress.
# Severe Aortic Stenosis.
Initially had planned for an "open approach" however secondary to extensive aortic calcification decision made to intervene percutaneously.
Posteroperative course was complicated by difficulty extubating patient.
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions and sputum culture was notable for GNR so patient was started on an 8 day course for VAP with Vanc/Meropenem.
Ms. [**Known lastname 87579**] had a difficult intubation and a #7ETT was used.
It was thought that poor SBT trial results were secondary to resistentence of tube.
ETT was eventually pulled without complication and patient was transitioned to Bi-Pap for 2 days as o2 saturations remained low.
Her Respiratory distress was most likely multifactorial with underlying hx of COPD, CHF, and infection playing a role.
Pulmomology saw the patient and believed symptoms were most likely secondary to COPD and recommended the patient continue spiriva as an outpt.
#CHF (acute on chronic diastolic dysfunction: Pt has long standing CHF and had signs of fluid overload (b/l peripheral edema, cardiogenic pulm edema)over course of admission.Diuresis was conservative at first in setting of hypotension.
Ms. [**Known lastname 87579**] had no episodes of CP, lightheadedness, or dizziness throughout the admission.
Metoprolol and valsartan were orginally held in setting of hypotension and restarted as pt's bp tolerated.
Foot was notable warm and slightly erythemic and the pain was thought to be secondary to gout.
She was started on colchicine with moderate improvement.
#Hyperglycemia: Pt had no history of diabetes as an outpt.
Her post-op course was complicated by hyperglycemia and she was started on a insulin drip while in the CCU.
Hyperglycemia was most likely secondary to stress response and underlying pre-diabetes.
Chronic Issues Managed:  #Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient has a baseline cr in the 1.2-1.3 range most likely secondary to HTN.
Pt only had a slight increase to 1.4 while on pressors with decreased UO.
# Hx of HTN: Patient's bp meds were held post-op secondary to hypotension.
Metoprolol and valsartan were continued once bp tolerated and imdur was held for entire admission.
# Hx of Depression: Patient showed no signs of depression and home regimen of Paroxetin continued.
# Normocytic Anemia: Chronic anemia with baseline hct of 33-34.
Will consider redosing as oupt with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] 2.Pt's home lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] dose transitioned to toresimide 20mg daily 3.Pt will continue treatment of COPD with home regimen and spiriva added 4.
She is started on glypizide on discharge for elevated bs and will follow up with PCP for monitoring.

You came her for treatment for your severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
You noted your symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath to be worsening and increasing in frequency.
Your postoperative course was complicated by your COPD disease and a pulmonologist was consulted who made some changes in your inhalers.
