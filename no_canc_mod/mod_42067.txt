Admission Date:  [**2135-4-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-5-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-4-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: expressive aphasia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2135-4-14**]: cerebral angiogram with partial embolization of AVM [**2135-5-3**] Re-embolization of AVM [**2135-5-5**] Trachesotomy [**2135-5-5**] PEG placement   History of Present Illness: 72 yo M hx CAD s/p AAA repair [**2133**] on ASA 325mg daily who presented with 3 days of HA and onset today of difficulty with word finding according to his wife.
He denies numbness, weakness tingling.
No dysarthria.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Plegic in right upper extremity.
Mild adjacent sulcal effacement.
There is no shift of midline structures.
These findings may represent a bleed from a vascular malformation.
Left frontal arteriovenous malformation with enlarged hypertrophied arteries arising from the A2 segment of anterior cerebral artery on the left and enlarged draining veins with multiple high flow venous aneurysms, draining into the superior sagittal sinus.
Unchanged left frontal intraparenchymal hematoma with surrounding vasogenic edema and mild mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
[**4-14**] CT Head- In comparison to study obtained 14 hours prior, there is no significant change in size and distribution of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the left frontal lobe.
No new area of intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
[**4-15**] CT Head- FINDINGS: Evaluation of the left frontal region is limited by streak artifact from metallic coils after AVM coiling.
Surrounding vasogenic edema is unchanged with mild mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
Mild mucosal thickening is seen in the ethmoid air cells.
No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
Status post coiling of left frontal AVM with unchanged parenchymal hemorrhage and surrounding edema in the left frontal lobe.
No new edema or hemorrhage.
Large areas of confluent consolidation with volume loss in both lower lobes, sparing only portions of the superior and anterior basal segments is atelectasis.
There is no bronchiectasis in either lower lobe or any obstructing mass in the left hilus.
A small region of peribronchial infiltration in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe, 3:17-20 could be an early pneumonia, but the upper lungs are otherwise relatively clear.
The interstitial abnormality in the lungs on the preceding conventional radiograph, three hours earlier, was due to transient pulmonary edema, accompanied by small left pleural effusion, all of which has resolved.
Atherosclerotic calcification is found in the left main, anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries, and at the bifurcation of the innominate artery and in the left subclavian artery arch and descending portion of the thoracic aorta, but the heart is only minimally enlarged.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
Severe bibasilar atelectasis.
No pneumonia or diffuse lung disease.
No bronchial obstruction on the left.
Right perihilar atelectasis and retained secretions cannot be distinguised from a hilar mass compromising lower lobe superior segment and basal trunk bronchi.
Suggest continued followup, first with conventional radiographs--subsequent chest radiograph available at the time of this review already showed improvment in RLL atelectasis.
Again noted is a 3.1 cm focus intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema adjacent to embolized AVM in the left frontal lobe, unchanged in size compared with a preprocedural CT.
Otherwise, there are no new hemorrhagic foci, or areas of infarction.
There is some sulci effacement of the left frontal lobe, but the remaining sulci are within normal limits.
A lacune is noted in the posterior limb of the right internal capsule suggestinf chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no evidence of fracture.
There is concentric thickening of the maxillary, sigmoidal, sphenoidal and frontal sinuses, which appear new compared with [**2135-4-14**].
Status post embolization of the left frontal AVM with unchanged focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and surrounding edema.
Interval increase in thickening of the mucosal lining of the sinuses suggests acute versus subacute sinusitis.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2135-4-19**] No DVT in the right or left lower extremity  LENI's [**2135-4-28**]:IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
Transverse colon passes anterior to the gastric body with the stomach in its presently decompressed state, limiting window for PEG placement.
Indeterminate 2.8-cm right adrenal nodule and possible 8 mm left adrenal nodule, which could be further evaluated with MRI or contrast enhanced CT washout protocol on a non-urgent basis.
Mild increase in bibasilar pulmonary densities consistent with atelectasis with increased superimposed consolidation.
Pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded.
Stable-appearing bifurcated infrarenal abdominal aortic graft.
Distal sigmoid colonic narrowing is felt likely to represent peristaltic activity but correlation with screening colonoscopy results is recommended.
Heterogeneous opacification at the lung bases has increased since [**4-29**] and there is a small irregular opacity in the right mid lung projecting over the medial aspect of the lower scapula which is more apparent today than previously.
No appreciable pleural effusion or indication of pneumothorax.
[**2135-5-4**] CT FINDINGS:  Streak artifact from Onyx embolization material again limits the evaluation of the adjacent parenchyma.
Allowing for this, there is continued evolution of the left frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with slight interval decrease in size of the hemorrhage and extent of surrounding vasogenic edema.
No new hemorrhage is seen.
There is no evidence of acute territorial infarction.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is moderate mucosal thickening in the sphenoid more than the ethmoidal air cells and left maxillary sinus.
There is fluid-opacification of the mastoid air cells, bilaterally, progressive over the series of studies dating to [**2135-4-13**], which likely relates to prolonged intubation and supine positioning.
No fracture is seen.
IMPRESSION:  Status post re-embolization of left frontal AVM with continued evolution of the left frontal parenchymal hemorrhage, and no new blood.
He underwent a CTA Head which revealed a left frontal arteriovenous malformation with enlarged hypertrophied arteries arising from the A2 segment of anterior cerebral artery on the left and enlarged draining veins with multiple high flow venous aneurysms, draining into the superior sagittal sinus.
It was noted post procedure that he had decreased movmement in the right UE/LE.
Overnight he developed respiratory distress requiring reintubation.
A CXR was performed which confirmed severe pulmonary edema bilaterally.
The patient continued to have a moderate amount of respiratory secretions.
Chest PT and frequent suctioning and repositing of the patient occured to maximize his respiratory status.
The patient had a weak cough and trouble independently raising secretions.
The white blood count was slightly elevated at 13.
The BUN was noted to be elevated at 43 and the White Blood Count was improved at 11.6.
The patient continued on Cefeipime for Mssa pneumonia and UTI.
[**Last Name (un) **] has been involved for elevated blood sugars.
On [**4-27**], patient became tachypnic and O2sats were dropping.
On [**4-28**], his EO to voice and he was spontaneous with L side, but no movement on the R side, no commands.
Follow up CT on [**5-4**] did not show and infacrt or acute changes.
LENS were done and there was no evidence of DVT.

Acetaminophen Extra Strength 500 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
