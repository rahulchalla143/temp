Patient became hypotensive during the case requiring vasopressin and levophed for pressure support.
Per wife, he has had no complaints and has been feeling well.

Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old male with complex medical history including CAD s/p remote MI, s/p CABG and PCI, ischemic CMP, s/p dual chamber pacemaker implant/ICD for high grade AV block who presented for elective BiV/ICD complicated by acidosis and hypotension.
# Pacemaker/ICD Placement:  Patient presented for elective BiV/ICD, while in the OR patient became hypotensive requiring levophed and vasopressin in the setting of large volume blood loss.
# Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive during OR case requiring use of levophed and vasopressin.
Patient reportedly had large blood loss during procedure and received total of 4 units of pRBC.
Other etiologies including cardiogenic, septic and adrenal insufficency were evaluated and ruled out as cause.
# RTA: On admission, patient appeared to have combined non-gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis in setting of ventilatory support.
Patient had persistant hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis post-extubation with an elevated urine pH and urine anion gap suggesting a distal renal tubular acidosis.
# Chronic systolic CHF: He just received replacement BiV pacemaker and his EF improved from 30-35% on admisison to LVEF 35-45% post-procedurely.
It was felt that this was a dilutional effect in the setting of recieving 4 units of pRBC with no additional platelets.
Hemolysis labs were negative, and there were no signs of bleeding.
# CAD: He has h/o CABG in the [**2112**] but no reported recent CP.
# HTN:  Patient's metoprolol and losartan were held initially due to hypotension, but were restarted at his home dose when he was hemodynamically stable.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pacemaker revision complicated by bleeding Acute blood loss anemia Chronic acidosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Additionally, you were found to have a kidney disorder that causes your blood to become very acidic, and you were started on medications to treat this.
