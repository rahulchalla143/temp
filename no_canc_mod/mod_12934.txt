Admission Date:  [**2200-7-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2200-7-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2139-10-8**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Transplant Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 60-year-old gentleman (status post orthotopic liver transplant on [**2200-6-16**] for end-stage renal disease secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis).
A couple of days ago, while undergoing a laboratory workup, he was noted to have increased liver function tests, and the patient was scheduled to have a liver biopsy done yesterday (on [**2200-7-16**]) by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].
His hematocrit upon presentation to the Emergency Department was 25, but he was also found to have a potassium level of 5.8 and a questionable ST elevation on electrocardiogram.
Acute renal failure.
Diabetes mellitus.
Grade II esophageal varices.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, the patient denied any chest pain, dyspnea, or any pain.
No nausea or vomiting.
There was 1 cm of jugular venous distention.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the bases.
There were no crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi.
The wound was well healed with staples in place.
The right groin had an area of ecchymosis where a prior line was removed and a pseudoaneurysm was resected.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An ultrasound was performed which revealed a 2.8 hematoma at the biopsy site.
The patient was initially thought to have a drop in his hematocrit, status post a biopsy, but his hematocrit was back to baseline at 25.
Cardiology evaluated the patient and felt that the anemia likely led to this small troponin leak, revealing underlying coronary artery disease.
However, the patient was entirely asymptomatic and with the correction of anemia he felt that a cardiac workup stress test was not urgent.
On hospital day two, on [**7-19**], the patient was noted to have a very stable hematocrit at 28.4 and a potassium level of 4.7.
Diabetes mellitus.
Underlying coronary artery disease.
Grade II esophageal varices.
The patient was currently to return to [**Hospital3 6373**] Center where he will undergo a cardiac stress test next week to further evaluate any underlying cardiac disease.
