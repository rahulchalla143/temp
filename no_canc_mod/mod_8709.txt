Bilateral peribronchial wall thickening.
Differential diagnosis includes atypical mycobacterium infection versus bronchopneumonia.
Hypodense lesion within segment IV of the liver is incompletely characterized on this examination.
Tubular soft tissue density in the region of the left adrenal gland possibly representing adrenal hyperplasia.
Heterogeneous lesion within the left thyroid gland which may be further evaluated with ultrasound.

CXR [**2185-3-29**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute pneumonia.
No pleural effusions or acute skeletal abnormalities are identified.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia@120BPM,L atrial abnormality, RBBB (new relative to EKG [**2184-6-15**]) 1mm ST depressions V2-V3, frequent PVC's.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 83yo M with DM and CAD, in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] 1 day for respiratory distress due to pneumonia who was stable and discharged from the floor.
# Pneumonia: SOB, cough have improved, but are still present.
He has been afebrile since transfer from to the floor but his WBC was still elevated until [**3-30**] when it was normal.
Opacity on chest CT c/w atypical pna.
Also could represent viral pneumonitis and aspiration.
Speech and swallow team evaluated and cleared for eating as pt has no apparent aspiration risk.
# Wheezing: pt w/ 25y h/o pipe smoking, stopped in [**2157**]'s.
Evidence of COPD on CT. Nebs improve breathing according to pt.
# Skin lesion: the dry, scaly, mildly erythematous yellow/brown skin on L ankle is less likely to be cellulitis as it is not hot, tender or swollen.
# Hypertension: pt w/ h/o HTN on amlodipine, lopressor, and lisinopril, furosamide at home, hypertensive in ED to SBP 200.
# Tachycardia: Tachy resolved on night of [**3-28**] w/ 500cc NS, lopressor PM dose, 0.5 mg ativan.
No evidence of PE on CTAngio.
On night of [**3-29**] episode of tachy with PVC resolved with lopressor.
Additional episode of tachy on night of [**3-31**] prompted increase of lopressor from 100mg to 150mg [**Hospital1 **] as above.
# H/o CAD: Other than SOB, no symptoms of ischemia.
s/p coated stent x 2 in [**2181**], and 60% non-stented LAD lesion [**2181**].
CK elevated (274, 397), but MB fraction <2.5% and minimally elevated Tn (0.02) make ACS unlikely.
[**Month (only) 116**] be small enzyme leak related to tachycardia (demand ischemia.
A repeat EKG ([**3-30**]) showed persistence of RBBB, but with negative enzymes, did not mandate further work-up.
# Frequent PVC's.
# Diabetes: NIDDM, on glyburide at home, currently blood sugars are controlled.
