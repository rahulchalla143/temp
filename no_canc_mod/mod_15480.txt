She ahd an ultrasound, which confirmed small stones and sludge, but a small gallbladder.
Because of her cardiac condition and because of the impending sepsis, it was thought perhaps percutaneous cholecystostomy would be appropriate, however, interventional radiology refused to do that, because of the size of the gallbladder.
She had multiple small stones, however, and it is speculated that perhaps one of these small stones had passed and actually managed to occlude the common duct.
Subsequently, the laboratory came back revealing that her liver enzymes were all normal preop, but nonetheless, the common bile duct size was clearly abnormal and therefore the cholangiograms were necessary.
Intra-operative cultures from the gall bladder later grew pansensitive E. Coli and she remained on Levoquin.
# Peri-operative myocardial infarction: Prior to surgery she was evaluated by cardiology given her significant cardiac history.
She was considered high risk for for a peri-op event, but little could be done to decrease her risk.
The acute myocardial infarction was thought to be demand ischemia.
A Swan cathether was placed on [**2103-12-10**] for improved monitoring especially given her rising cardiac enzymes and her oliguria.
An Echo was obtained on [**2103-12-11**] showing Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
# Acute Renal Failure: [**2103-12-10**] The patient became oliguric with an acutely rising creatinine.
Upon discharge she was tolerating a regular diet, had good pain control with PO pain medications, was ambulating with assistance, and her renal function was normal.
