HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure and transient ischemic attacks who had a cardiac catheterization on [**2163-12-20**], after developing dyspnea.
The cardiac catheterization was significant for diffuse disease in the small obtuse marginal 2 and 90% stenosis of the mid and distal right coronary artery and moderate aortic stenosis.
On [**2164-1-26**], she had an echocardiogram which showed left ventricular hypertrophy, inferior basal hypokinesis and ejection fraction of 55%, mild mitral stenosis and mitral valve orifice of 2 by 2 cm, moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 45 and an aortic valve of .9 cm by 2 cm and [**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement.
Over the past year she has been treated for progressive shortness of breath with no exertion.
She does not even feel she would be capable of climbing stairs due to the severity of her dyspnea.
She does not have any chest pain.
Cardiac risk factors include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes.
On [**2165-2-6**] she underwent a cardiac catheterization and was found to have two vessel disease.
The left main coronary artery had a 10% distal lesion.
The left anterior descending had a 70-80% lesion in the mid portion.
Following this cardiac catheterization the patient was evaluated by the Cardiothoracic Service and now she presents to [**Hospital6 1760**] for definitive therapy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure and transient ischemic attacks (ten years ago), arthritis, neuropathy, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is an obese female in no acute distress.
Abdomen is soft and nontender.
There is no peripheral edema.
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 59 with first degree atrioventricular block.
There is left axis deviation and left ventricular hypertrophy.
The chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusions, no pulmonary vascular congestions to suggest heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient went to the Operating Room on the day of admission and underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm pericardial valve and a coronary artery bypass graft with an left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending anastomosis.
She transferred to the Surgery Intensive Care Unit with mean arterial pressure of 65, CP of 12, being A-V paced and on Neosynephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg/min.
She was given colloid Hespan for low urine output which showed no improvement.
She remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile and on postoperative day #2 she was transferred to the floor for the remainder of her recovery.
On postoperative day #3 the patient had an episode of shortness of breath and was found to be in atrial fibrillation on the monitor.
On postoperative day #5 she had another episode of atrial flutter with a rate of 70 and blood pressure of 153/82.
Pulmonary consultation was obtained and working with them the patient received chest x-ray which showed large left pleural effusion.
The patient was able to participate in physical therapy, ambulate and denied any shortness of breath.
For the episodes of atrial fibrillation the patient was also anticoagulated with heparin and started on Coumadin.
Aortic valve stenosis, status post aortic valve replacement with 21 ml pericardial valve 3.
Atrial fibrillation 4.
Diabetes mellitus 5.
Hypertension 6.

Transient ischemic attacks  MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1.
