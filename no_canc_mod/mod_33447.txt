CTA Head and Neck: CT OF THE HEAD: No edema, mass, mass effect, hemorrhage or infarction is detected.
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent consistent with involutional changes.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are noted.
The visualized part of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
CTA OF THE HEAD AND THE NECK: The vertebral and carotid arteries and their branches are patent with no significant mural irregularity or flow-limiting stenosis.
No aneurysm is detected.
Incidental note is made of fenestration at the origin and proximal portion of the A2 segment of the right ACA, as well as fetal PCAs, bilaterally.
The distal cervical portion of the right carotid artery measures 6.2 mm on the right, and 5.6 mm on the left.
CT PERFUSION: No abnormality of cerebral blood flow, blood volume or the mean transit time within the middle cerebral artery vascular territory.
No acute intracranial process, including no hemorrhage and no evidence of acute infarction (perfusion assessment largely limited to the MCA territory).
MRI/A Head: FINDINGS: Abnormal slow diffusion consistent with acute infarct is seen in the right parasagittal frontal lobe, in the distal right MCA distribution.
Additionally, there is apparent bilateral cortical parietal parasagittal swelling, without corresponding abnormal diffusion signal (series 12, image 20).
There is no acute hemorrhage, shift of midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
Large bilateral PComs also identified.
Findings consistent with infarct in the distal right ACA territory, not visualized on prior CT perfusion study.
Relative attenuation of the left A1 segment compared to right, possibly representing embolus or spasm.
Bilateral parasagittal cortical swelling the parietal lobe, without corresponding diffusion abnormality.
TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There was few bubbles late ([**4-9**] heart beats) with cough manuever.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with low normal systolic function.
No definitive PFO identified.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 55 yo RHM who presented with an acute onset left hemiparesis (leg > arm, no facial weakness, and slightly slower production of speech, but no aphasia).
Given his history of A fib it was felt to most likely be a cardioembolic stroke, and he was subtherapeutic on his Coumadin on presentation (INR 1.3 at OSH prior to tPA).
He received IV tPA at 3 am and was admitted to ICU initially where he remained stable with improving L sided weakness and no hemorrhagic transformation confirmed with repeat CT the next day.
MRI showed L ACA distribution stroke likely embolic in nature given Afib and subtherapeutic INR.
[**Last Name (STitle) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 3078**] L [**Telephone/Fax (1) 65542**]   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: R ACA Cerebral infarct likely embolic Atrial fibrillation  Discharge Condition: Stable - L leg weakness more than arm but no issues with speech or swallowing.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after acute L sided weakness after IV tPA in the ED with hx of atrial fibrillation but subtherapeutic INR.
You were initially admitted to the ICU where you were monitored and treated including follow-up CT of head which did not show hemorrhagic transformation.
You remained stable with improving L sided weakness hence you were transferred to the floor on [**1-25**] and you were restarted on Coumadin with Lovenox bridging.
Please call your PCP or go to the nearest ED if you have new/worsening weakness or numbness, speech issues or vision problems.
