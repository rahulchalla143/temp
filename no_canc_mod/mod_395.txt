Admission Date:  [**2103-3-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-3-11**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Augmentin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Mixed respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation CVL  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old female with a PMH significant for HTN, asthma, and chronic mixed respiratory failure followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] now admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
At that time, she was disoriented and looked short of breath with a "glassy look in her eyes."
Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 4256**] for hypoxemia of unclear etiology with hospital course complicated by aspiration pneumonia.
She has since followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Pulmonary with suspicion for chronic mixed respiratory failure, possibly from neuromuscular disease, pulmonary hypertension from dCHF and elevated left-sided pressures, and kyphoscoliosis.
She was then noted to be persistently hypoxemic and then became hypotensive, and so was intubated.
Cardiology was consulted for question of NSTEMI given a TnT of 0.04, who felt that the patient was not in over cardiogenic shock or having a plaque rupture.
Past Medical History: - Hypoxemia, chronic hypercarbia felt to be secondary to restrictive physiology from possible neuromuscular deficit.
- History of asthma, but has not been treated with any medications.
- Hypertension.
- Osteoporosis.
- History of uterine cancer resected in [**2077**] without recurrence.
- History of kidney stones.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild global biventricular systolic dysfunction, most c/w diffuse process (toxic, metabolic, etc).
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old female with a PMH significant for HTN, asthma, and chronic mixed respiratory failure followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure with hospital course complicated by fevers, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and inability to clear secretions upon extubation.
Mixed respiratory failure/Goals of care: A-a gradient of 145 on admission in setting of likely dynamic hyperinflation with NIPPV.
Patient has a chronic element of CO2 retention with a HCO3 in the 30-40s since [**2081**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] concerned about a neuromuscular disorder.
In addition, she has K-S on CXR and signs of elevated filling pressures with an estimated TRG 45 in 1/[**2102**].
