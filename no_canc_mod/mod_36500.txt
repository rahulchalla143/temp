Of note, pt discharged 2 weeks ago after a COPD exacerbation and has been on 3L home oxygen.
No fever, chills, CP or cough.
CXR showed no infiltrate.
She was admitted to the ICU for further treatment of her presumed COPD flare.
Currently unemployed, lives with boyfriend x 12 years  Family History: No lung disease  Physical Exam: T: 98.7 BP: 190/96 -> 154/96 HR: 92 RR: 35 -> 21 O2 94% 3L Gen: NAD but accessory muscle use, speaking in full sentences HEENT: No conjunctival pallor.
NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD.
CXR in ED: Again is noted bilateral oligemia with relative hyperlucency in both upper lung zones consistent with patient's known history of emphysema.
No focal opacities or infiltrates are noted.
There is no pleural effusion.
Mild mediastinal asymmetry is likely due to rotational factors.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process or pneumonia.
Unchanged appearance of emphysematous changes.
EKG: ST at 111, normal axis, no significant changes from prior.
Chest CT [**4-8**]: As compared to the previous examination of [**2106-11-17**], there is no relevant change.
Very extensive panlobular emphysema that is slightly more predominant in the lung apices than in the lung bases.
A 4-5 mm partly calcified nodule located adjacent to the bronchus supplying the lateral segment of the middle lobe is unchanged in size.
Coexisting chronic airways disease.
No evidence of pleural effusions.
The size of the left-sided adrenal adenoma is unchanged.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Small left lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary embolism.
Please note poor opacification of distal smaller subsegmental vessels.
No large lobar, segmental, or large subsegmental emboli are evident.
Unchanged panlobular emphysematous changes with chronic bronchial wall thickening.
Brief Hospital Course: 46 year old female with a PMH of asthma/COPD on home O2 at 3LNC, current smoker and HCV who is being admitted with COPD flare.
# COPD exacerbation: Severe COPD, continues to smoke.
afebrile but with leukocytosis.
Initial ABG showed hypercarbia with pCO2 85 and elevated bicarb suggestive of acute on chronic resp.
SOB likely [**2-12**] COPD flair with PE as possible contributing factor (see below).
Given extensive psychiatric history Chanitix is likely not an optimal medication for her, Zyban may be a possibility.
# PE:  Dyspnea was largely due to COPD exacerbation, as above.
However, given her hypoxia and tachycardia, CTA was done which showed a small subsegmental PE.
# GAD/depression/agoraphobia: On multiple meds as outpatient including citalopram, clonazepam, clonidine, risperdal, divalproex, mirtazepine.
# HTN: Hypertensive on admission to 190s, however the patient does not carry this diagnosis.
Likely at least partly due to anxiety & steroids.
Clonidine 0.1 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO TID PRN () as needed for anxiety.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism Secondary Diagnoses: tobacco abuse, depression, generalized anxiety disorder   Discharge Condition: At baseline home oxygen level.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized with an exacerbation of COPD as well as a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in your lung).
