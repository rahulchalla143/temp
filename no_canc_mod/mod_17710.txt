Patient had been relatively symptom free since her CABG until she eas evaluated as an outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32772**] for chest pain.
At that time, patient refused stress testing or further evaluation.
On presentation she described a left sided chest pain lasting 10 minutes that was associated with L-arm tingling, rating [**7-2**].
Patient took ASA 325mg at home, and then presented to [**Hospital3 **] after pain returned.
She described no SOB, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, back pain, or abdominal pain.
On presentation to the ED, patient was pain free, VSS.
EKG demonstrated 1mm ST elevations in III, aVF, and ST depressions in I and aVL.
In total she received 1.5L of fluid prior to arrival in CCU and was defibrillated x1.
ROS at OSH notable for unsteady gait w/ involuntary movement of her R-arm and R-leg.
LIMA had low flow and was not used.
- Hypothyroidism - Hypertension - Dyslipidemia - Previous TIA - s/p Appendectomy - s/p Mastectomy  Social History: 25 pack year history of tobacco.
No alcohol or illegal drug abuse.
Does not follow commands, but occasionally grimaces and moves extremities.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pale, no cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Chest: No scoliosis or kyphosis.
+wheezes, no rales or ronchi.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Generalized increased interstitial markings are noted, grossly unchanged as well as there is no significant change in small bilateral pleural effusions, findings consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
Stent in bypass graft most likely going to the RCA or PDA is again noted in unchanged location on both PA and lateral views.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of mild pulmonary edema accompanied by small pleural effusion.
LENI [**2134-10-6**]: FINDINGS: Grayscale, color, and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins demonstrate normal compression, color flow, waveforms, and augmentation.
There is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
[**2134-10-4**] TTE Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall, distal septum and apex.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction suggestive of multivessel CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterolateral wall and basal inferior wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Impression on arrival was for a vagal episode in the setting of groin pressure for bleeding from the femoral sheath site, leading to atropine and then V. Fib arrest.
In CCU, patient had bleeding from her groin site requiring firm pressure for 30 minutes, and in this setting became transiently hypotensive and bradycardic.
She had no recurrence of NSVT, VT, or V.Fib while in the CCU.
Beta-blocker/ACE were held in setting of cardiogenic shock requiring pressor support.
She continued to have SOB however, requiring diuresis with lasix 20mg IV over 3 days with good UOP.
On the day of discharge patient was able to ambulate 50 yards w/o difficulty and w/o oxygen (O2 Sat 93%RA w/ exertion).
#Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Patient had a significant 11 point hematocrit drop during her CCU stay.
CT scan of the chest and abdomen demonstrated a small hematoma at the site of her left-femoral sheath, a small hematoma in the rectus abdominus muscle, and a small hematoma at the site of her central line placement (R-IJ).
Here HIT antibody was negative and platelets stabilized and heparin was restarted prior to discharge with stable hematocrit, platelets and no evidence of bleeding.
As part of her work-up, the patient was noted to have trace guaiac positive stools, and was recommended for outpatient follow-up with colonoscopy.
Coronary Artery Disease s/p Bare Metal Stents x3 Hypertension Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Stable, 93% on room air with exertion (walking on flat ground).
It was determined that you had decreased blood supply to your heart and would benefit from a reopening of the blood vessels to your heart.
Should you have any chest pain, sudden or new shortness of breath, or any other symptom concerning to you please call your PCP or return to the Emergency Department.
It is recommended that you discuss with your PCP having [**Name Initial (PRE) **] colonoscopy as you have evidence of mild bleeding in your stools.
Please discuss having a colonoscopy with your PCP as you have mild evidence of bleeding in your stools.
