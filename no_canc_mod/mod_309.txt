Admission Date:  [**2107-7-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2107-7-26**]   Service:  ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Status post cardiac arrest  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 89 year old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed with chronic anemia, chronic renal insufficiency who had been complaining at home of lower back pain.
On the morning of admission her daughter was helping her to the bathroom when the patient collapsed without breathing, without pulse.
Emergency Medical Services arrived and placed an automated external defibrillator which determined a shockable rhythm.
She was given Atropine and a second shock and went into an atrial fibrillation rhythm with a rapid ventricular response.
The patient arrived to the Emergency Room in rapid atrial fibrillation with a blood pressure in the 80s and was started on intravenous fluids.
Initial electrocardiograms showed no significant ST or T wave changes.
At this time it is felt likely that she had suffered a primary arrhythmia leading to her arrest.
She has a history of a congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in [**2107-1-31**] showing concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 50%.
She had biatrial enlargement, moderate mitral regurgitation and severe pulmonary hypertension.
She also had a history of chronic anemia.
She has a history of a gastrointestinal bleed in [**2107-3-31**] which was felt to be due to a gastric arteriovenous malformation.
She also has chronic thrombocytopenia with a baseline platelet count of about 80,000.
She also has chronic renal insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination showed her to be normocephalic, atraumatic with bilateral surgical pupils.
Neck examination was supple with no jugulovenous distension appreciated.
There was no lymphadenopathy noted.
Cardiac examination showed a right ventricular heave.
Her abdomen was soft and distended but nontender.
Her extremities showed trace peripheral edema.
There was no spontaneous movement noted.
Urinalysis revealed no red cells, no white cells and no casts.
Electrocardiogram showed an atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and infrequent ectopy.
She received a chest and abdominal computerized tomography scan showing no aortic aneurysm.
There was no dissection but there was a small right pleural effusion.
Head computerized tomography scan showed periventricular white matter changes but no acute bleed.
The patient had her potassium repleted by both p.o.
and intravenous replacement with a rapid rise in potassium to 3.5 on the first day of admission.
The patient underwent bedside electroencephalogram to evaluate for neural activity as well as potential seizure activity.
She did continue to have episodes of epileptiform activity on her bedside electroencephalogram and so Valproate was added to her regimen at that point.
With therapeutic levels of Valproate and Phenobarbital she was felt to have control of her epileptic activity.
In addition to the epileptiform activity the bedside electroencephalogram revealed significant anoxic encephalopathy.
As a result the plan was made for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and tracheostomy which initially was held up due to elevated INRs which corrected slowly with the addition of Vitamin K.  The patient was started on tube feeds which she tolerated well.
On [**7-25**], showing no further epileptiform activity and with a corrected INR the patient had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and tracheostomy tube placed.
She has had no further significant ectopic activity.
Cardiovascular - A.  Arrhythmia, the patient was felt to have a primary arrhythmia due to hypokalemia in the setting of pre-existing structural heart disease.
It is not felt that this was an ischemic event and with the corrected potassium she has had no further ectopic activity.
It was elected to defer any further electrophysiologic study at this time given the approximate cause of a low potassium.
B.  Coronary artery disease, patient with a history of coronary artery disease but does not seem to have had an acute coronary spasm.
The patient has had no difficulty with her oxygenation, however, after trials of pressure support mode, the patient developed apnea and required to be placed back on assist control mode of ventilation.
Renal - The patient with stable renal function throughout her stay here with no elevation in BUN and creatinine.
The patient has had some progressive peripheral edema, though no respiratory compromise.
Gastrointestinal - The patient is getting feedings through her percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, is tolerating it well with low residuals.
There has been no evidence of gastrointestinal bleed though she was initially guaiac positive from below.
Infectious disease - The patient with no acute infectious problems.
The patient did, during her hospital stay have one out of four bottles positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis.
Although the patient has continued to have a mildly elevated white count, she has had no other focal signs of infection and she has not been treated with antibiotics.
There is no indication for adrenal compromise as well.
DISPOSITION:  The patient is to be sent for longterm care.
