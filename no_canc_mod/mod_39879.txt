The largest fracture fragment involves the medial tibial plateau with 4 mm lateral displacement of the distal tibia.
A large anterior fracture fragment arising from the lateral tibial plateau also demonstrates slight displacement.
Finally, there is a comminuted fracture of the lateral aspect of the proximal fibula.
There is no evidence of femoral or patellar fracture.
There is a large lipohemarthrosis in the suprapatellar region and a small [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.
There is soft tissue edema.
IMPRESSION: Comminuted tibial and fibular fractures as above.
TTE [**2160-5-19**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>65%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is severe [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and normal regional excellent global systolic function.
At least moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dilated ascending aorta.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.
The LAD had 80% mid-vessel stenosis and there was 70% stenosis at the origin of a large diagonal.
The LCx had no significant disease.
The RCA had 50% mid-vessel stenosis in a non-dominant vessel.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Moderate (2+) [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2).
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Calcium chunks were also seen on the atrial aspect of the P2 scallop of anterior mitral leaflelt probably leading to increased transmitral gradient and mod mitral stenosis.
Postoperatively, Orthopeadics followed up on her left tibial plateau fracture immobilization brace.
Coumadin was resumed for atrial fibrillation.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
She remained non-weight bearing on the left lower extremity per ortho recommendations.
