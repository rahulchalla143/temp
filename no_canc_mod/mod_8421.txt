Left common iliac artery and external iliac artery recanalization with balloon angioplasty and stenting.
History of Present Illness: 71F with PVD and multiple revascularization procedures due to infected bypass grafts who presented with recurrent infected L. fem-BK-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass graft with bacteremia due to pseudomonas, proteus and MRSA.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p PTCA/drug eluting stent of RCA ([**2-18**]), CHF, EF 60% ([**2143-10-19**]), HTN, ^chol, GIB [**1-17**] ASA, DM2, MRSA, VRE, carotid stenoses (R 40-59%, L 60-69%)  PSH: Ao-bifem ([**2128**]), B fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] ([**2127**]), fem-fem w/ R SFA endart ([**2127**]), removal fem-fem ([**2128**]), re-do left CFA-bk [**Doctor Last Name **] w/PTFE and thrombectomy of L CFA ([**11-16**]), L temporal artery Bx ([**3-19**]), R jumpgraft f/ R fem-ak [**Doctor Last Name **] w/ PTFE to BK [**Doctor Last Name **], [**Doctor Last Name **] a. endart [**2-17**], exc.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A small hyperdense fluid collection is identified starting just inferior to the left renal lower pole in the retroperitoneum and extending down to the pelvic brim just superior to where the iliacus muscle begins.
This likely represents a small hematoma, likely related to recent left retroperitoneal surgical dissection.
The liver displays no focal masses.
There is a grossly unchanged appearance to a slightly prominent common bile duct and very minimal intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
No ductal stones are identified and the pancreatic duct is also mildly prominent.
Again identified is prominence of the adrenal glands bilaterally, the left adrenal gland lesion appears to be a benign adenoma and the right adrenal lesion is indeterminate, but likely benign.
The patient is status post removal of previous left aortofemoral bypass graft and left femoral popliteal bypass graft.
Since prior examination, there has been interval placement of a left common iliac and external iliac artery stent.
The right aortofemoral bypass graft appears patent and again displays areas of focal thickening as noted on prior CT examination.
There is no free air or pathologically enlarged abdominal lymphadenopathy identified.
There are diffuse coronary and aortic calcifications.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is marked stranding of the subcutaneous tissues, likely from prior surgery as well as multiple hyperattenuating soft tissue lesions, likely related to subcutaneous injections.
Superior to the left external iliac artery prior to its formation of the left common femoral artery, there is an ill-defined 2.3 x 2.5 cm pocket of fluid collection with multiple pockets of air bubbles.
This was not noted on prior examination and may represent a normal post-surgical fluid collection, surgi-seal, or an early abscess.
Other small pockets of fluid collection are noted more distally within the left thigh.
The distal arteries are difficult to evaluate in terms of patency due to the limits of this study, however, the left common femoral and profunda branches appear patent and the left SFA appears diffusely diseased with no gross contrast noted within the vessel.
Note is made of a slightly enlarged left inguinal lymph node measuring approximately 1.8 x 1.4 cm, likely reactive.
No pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph nodes are identified.
There is trace free fluid noted within the pelvic cavity.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious blastic or lytic lesions are identified.
Again identified are changes likely related to a prior right inferior pubic ramus fracture.
There are degenerative changes of the spine.
Small left-sided retroperitoneal hyperdense fluid collection/hematoma.
Likely related to recent surgical dissection within this area.
Bilateral pleural effusions and compression atelectasis.
Small focal fluid collection anterior to the left external iliac artery with air bubbles.
Left adrenal adenoma with indeterminant right adrenal lesion.
Status post removal of left aortofemoral bypass graft and left femoral popliteal bypass graft with interval placement of left common and external iliac stents, unable to definitively assess patency of distal vessels on this non- angiographic CT.   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **]  presented to us complaining of fevers from recurrent infected L. fem-BK-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass graft with bacteremia due to pseudomonas, proteus and MRSA.
She was evaluated by the Vascular surgery department and found to have infected L aorto femoral limb and left fem-bk [**Doctor Last Name **] bypass grafts.
She tolerated the procedure well without any difficulty or complication.
On the floor, she remained hemodynamically stable with her pain controlled.
She continues to make steady progress without any incidents.
Please call our office nurse if you have any questions.
ACTIVITY:  There are no specific restrictions on activity.
Resume driving when you are comfortable without the need for pain medication.
PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:  Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s).
New pain, numbness or discoloration of your foot or toes.
Watch for signs and symptoms of infection.
These are: a fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus draining from the incision site.
If you experience any of these or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.
A clear dressing may cover your leg incision and this should be left in place for three (3) days.
You will be given a new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary.
Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet.
(Check with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.)
Eat small balanced meals throughout the day.
CAUTIONS:  NO SMOKING!
DIET :  There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively.
For people with vascular problems we would recommend a cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile in your blood.
