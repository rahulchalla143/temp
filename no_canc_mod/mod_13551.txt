Closed reduction right carpal dislocation, release of     carpal tunnel, anterior capsular repair and placement of     external fixator.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 28 year old man with no known medical history who is s/p fall from approximately 25 feet with no LOC but does have left facial abrasions, who was transferred from an OSH after 2 reported seizures requiring intubation.
Per the OSH records, the patient fell 20-25 feet from a 6 foot ladder onto a deck, with reportedly negative LOC but he had multiple abrasions to his left face and head and bilateral open wrist fractures.
He complained of moderate aching neck pain, and bilateral wrist pain.
He also had frontal pain.
CT C-spine showed no fracture.
Right wrist films showed scaphoid fracture and perilunate dislocation.
Left wrist films showed perilunate dislocation and displaced scaphoid fracture.
There is no recorded description of the event or indication of its duration.
VS: temp 99.7, bp 134/75, HR 104, RR 16, SaO2 96% on ventilator Genl: Intubated, off sedation HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, + bilateral conjunctival injection, large left facial laceration with oozing blood, hard C-collar in place.
CV: Regular rate, Nl S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriorly and laterally, no wheezes, rhonchi, rales Abd: +BS, soft, NTND abdomen Ext: Bilateral wrist splints in place for fractures.
No obvious facial asymmetry.
No observed myoclonus or tremor.
2-3 beats of ankle clonus bilaterally.
No evidence of acute intrathoracic, abdominal or pelvic trauma.
Minimal bullous changes in the right apex.
Left carpal deformity - correlate with radiograph.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Ill-defined 1 cm area of hypodensity in the subcortical white matter of right frontal lobe is likely chronic.
MRI of the brain on a non-emergent basis may be obtained to further assess given the recent seizure activity.
[**2187-12-5**] CT C Spine : No acute fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine  [**2187-12-5**] Xray Bilat upper ext : 1.
Extensive T2 and STIR hyperintensities involving the cervical spine and in the visualized portions of the thoracic spine, which in conjunction with the [**Month/Day/Year 4493**] in the brain is most concerning for a demyelinating process such as ADEM or multiple sclerosis.
Interspinous soft tissue edema raises concern for mild interspinous ligamentous injury.
Extensive pericallosal, periventricular, subcortical and deep white matter foci as well as abnormal signal in the posterior fossa, the corpus callosum, the optic nerves, and at least one focus of cortical involvement.
The [**Month/Day/Year 4493**] are highly concerning for a demyelinating process such as ADEM or multiple sclerosis.
Other differential diagnoses would include toxic metabolic processes and infection, although these are considered much less likely, given the callosal, optic nerve, posterior fossa and cervical spine involvement.

Oligoclonal bands (4 or more CSF-specific bands) and/or an elevated CSF IgG index are detected in up to 90% of patients with MS.

The [**Known lastname 4493**] were specific for some type of demyelinating process (ie Multiple Sclerosis) and were not related to trauma.
He improved dramatically over the next 24 hours except for a temperature spike to 101.
He was pan cultured and also underwent LP to rule out HSV encephalitis as well as oligoclonal band testing to rule out multiple sclerosis.
He did have oligoclonal bands in his CSF which could aid in the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.
From the standpoint of his traumatic accident he remained free of any seizure activity, his mental status was improving daily and he was coping well with his bilateral wrist injuries.
His weight bearing status for his upper extremities was non weight bearing for his hands but full weight bearing for his forearms.
Prior to discharge he underwent an EEG to rule out any seizure activity.
He had some intermittent delta wave slowing in the right temporal region and will continue on dilantin until his appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] and then be re evaluated.

* No weight bearing of your hands but OK to bear weight on your forearms.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
