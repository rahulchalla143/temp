Initial Head CT [**8-31**]: CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: The obtained images demonstrate an intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving the inferior aspect of the right temporal lobe measuring approximately 4.2 x 3.2 cm.
Surrounding vasogenic edema is seen.
There is no hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of infarction elsewhere.
1.9 cm hypodense sellar and suprasella cystic lesion is present causing smooth osseous sellar expansion.
Intracranial vascular calcifications are noted.
Right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema.
Further evaluation with contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended to rule out underlying vascular lesion or mass.
1.9 cm suprasellar/sellar cyst likely represents an arachnoid or epidermoid cyst.
Repeat Head CT [**9-1**]: unchanged from admission CT  MRI not obtained  Brief Hospital Course: The event at home was felt to be a partial complex seizure with secondary generalization.
Head CT in the ED showed some evidence of hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe, around the area where he was known to have a cavernoma.

He was initially started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
Repeat Head CT the next morning showed no change in the hemorrhage, and his exam was again normal except for the NLF flattening.
He had no evidence of further seizures in house.
He was asked to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with Neuro-Surgery to discuss treatment options for the cavernoma (including surgery, Cyberknife, or observation), and with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in our stroke service.
