Admission Date:  [**2112-12-3**]       Discharge Date: [**2112-12-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2054-10-16**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 58-year-old male with CHF, CAD, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, COPD, diabetes with severe autonomic dysfunction originally admitted on the [**11-29**] with fevers, shortness of breath, fatigue, and bilateral perfusions.
Patient had been admitted for pneumonia and subsequently developed sepsis, respiratory failure and was briefly intubated and started on sepsis protocol.
Patient underwent thoracentesis with fluid showing transudative effusion in the ICU.
Initially started on amiodarone status post cortisone stim test status post hydrocortisone, coagulopathy secondary to malnutrition.
No multivessel disease.
Most recent stress test in [**2112-10-22**] negative for reversible defects.
Peripheral vascular disease status post CVA in [**2104**].
Diabetes with complicated by end-stage renal disease, retinopathy/neuropathy.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Bilateral cataracts.
Severe autonomic dysfunction.
Reglan - nausea and vomiting.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical exam is significant, in general significant for cachexia and evidence of malnourishment.
Cardiovascular shows a regular, rate, and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
Lungs showed decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Abdominal examination was nontender and nondistended.
Cardiovascular: A. Coronary artery disease:  Patient had been admitted to the MICU with a mild troponin leak and flat enzymes possibly thought secondary to CHF and end-stage renal disease.
B. CHF:  Patient with known CHF, ejection fraction of 30-35%.
Patient was generally felt to be in consistent volume overload, although well compensated.
His volume overload was believed to be manifested in recurrent pleural effusions.
He remains quite challenging from a ......... standpoint and CHF standpoint as secondary to his autonomic dysfunction and difficulty taking fluid off without developing hypotension.
He was maintained on midodrine pre-hemodialysis and also on Florinef for severe orthostatic hypotension.
As eluded to above, it was difficult titrating up his ACE inhibitor and beta blockade secondary to labile and orthostatic hypotension.
C. Hemodynamics:  As mentioned above, patient with labile blood pressure secondary to orthostasis, autonomic dysfunction.
D. Rhythm:  During hospital course on the floor, the patient had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
It was felt by the primary team that patient would not be a good anticoagulation candidate secondary to his propensity for falling.
Pulmonary: A. Pneumonia/sepsis:  Patient was transferred from the ICU after respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions:  Patient underwent re-thoracentesis of recurrent pleural effusions on both left and right side.
C. COPD:  Patient came in with COPD and being intubated initially for his pneumonia and respiratory failure.
He has a history of severe gastroparesis and has severe anorexia.
He was not anticoagulated for his episodes of AFib as he was thought to be a fall risk secondary to his orthostasis.
Renal:  Patient has end-stage renal disease now on hemodialysis.
He was going to followup closely by the renal team for management of his CHF/recurrent pleural effusions as mentioned above.
He was also continued on midodrine for hypertension associated with hemodialysis and was continued on Florinef also for presumed orthostasis.
He will likely need rehabilitation given his severe cardiopulmonary disease, his diabetes, and autonomic dysfunction as well as his knee for dialysis.
Congestive heart failure/bilateral pleural effusions.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
