high pressures within fistula per renal team.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please eval fistula INDICATION OF EXAM: This is a left AV fistulogram for a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease.
Using palpatory technique and after injection of 1 cc of 1% lidocaine, the AV fistula was accessed with a 21 gauge needle pointing towards the venous outflow.
The inner dilator and the wire were removed, and hand injection of contrast demonstrates good positioning of the micropuncture sheath within the left cephalic vein.
Serial venograms were performed at the level of the arm, shoulder and chest, for possible venous outflow stenosis.
Based on these diagnostic findings, it was decided that the patient would benefit from balloon dilation of these lesions.
A roadmap venogram was obtained, and a 6 mm balloon was advanced over the wire up to the level of the narrowings, and several balloon dilations were performed at dilations up to 15 ATM.
Followup venogram demonstrated partial angiographic improvement of venous outflow after dilation.
Films were also obtained for evaluation of the arterial anastomosis without any significant stenosis seen.
Left AV fistulogram demonstrates two areas of venous narrowing at the level of the proximal cephalic vein near the fistula and near the junction of the cephalic vein with the axillary vein.
US EXTREMITY NONVASCULAR RIGHT  [**2154-11-4**] 12:12 PM  US EXTREMITY NONVASCULAR RIGHT  Reason: R/O DVT, SWELLING  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 58 year old man with right arm swelling REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please rule out upper extremity DVT INDICATION: Right upper extremity swelling.
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color and spectral Doppler ultrasound images of right upper extremity veins were obtained.
Flow and compressibility is demonstrated within both internal jugular veins.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
Brief Hospital Course: #GI BLEED: Patient was intially admitted to the ICU for management of his GI Bleed.
Patient was seen by GI who felt that given the patients extensive history of GI bleeds and multitude of studies that have been done, there was no acute need for intervention.
The previous workups have included at least six endoscopies, three colonoscopies, one enteroscopy, and a capsule camera study, and all have been negative, except for small AVM's in the duodenum seen and cauterized on one study and minor jejunal erosions noted  on the capsule camera study.
He received HD on first 2 days of admission given extensive volume overload and then resumed on his regular outpatient schedule.
An AV fistulogram was done which showed stenosis at the venous anastomosis and angioplasty was done x4 with partial resolution.
ASA was initially held given GI bleed but resumed on hospital day #4.
He remained chest pain free during remaining stay.
He was restarted on his Lisinopril on the day of discharge given his slightly elevated BP.
He had positive cocaine urine tox screen while in the hospital.
In addition, the patient has a known history of depression.
Patient was seen by psychiatry during his stay for agitation and delirium  which occured during his initial ICU stay.
It was felt that the patients delirium was secondary to not being dialyzed for over a week.
The patient remained depressed but had no suicidal ideation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: GI Bleed   Discharge Condition: Improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for bloody stools and fatigue.
In addition, you had some blood tests to rule out any evidence of ischemia to your heart.
We stopped 2 medications that you had previously been taking for blood pressure.
You will not take your Isosorbide Mononitrate or your Amlodipine.
You should return to the ED with fatigue, dizziness, black or bloody stools, recurrent chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or for any other problems that concern you.
