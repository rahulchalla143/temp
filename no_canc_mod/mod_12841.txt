Neurological:  The patient presented with a blind right eye and continued throughout the hospital course with a blind right eye.
The patient's pain was controlled well with Oxycodone; however, the patient did begin complaining of some hallucinations on postoperative day #8, which seemed to improve once the patient was taken off Oxycodone and other opiates.

In addition, the patient did have some signs of acute renal failure with an increasing creatinine which reached its peak of 1.7 on postoperative day #8 and dropped back down to 1.3 which was very close to his baseline of 1.1 by the time of discharge.
