Admission Date: [**2114-3-21**]        Discharge Date: [**2114-3-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-1-8**]        Sex:  M  Service:  MED   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post ablation at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2114-3-19**] followed by a prednisone taper started by the Electrophysiology Team for PV stenosis who presents status post ablation with shortness of breath.
Per the patient, he had an uneventful postablation course until noon of [**2114-3-20**], when he noted an acute onset of shortness of breath, wheezing and extreme dyspnea on exertion.
The patient's family took him to [**Hospital **] Hospital for workup where vitals showed a temperature 101.3 degrees, heart rate 122, blood pressure 237/137, respiratory rate 48 and oxygen saturation 81 percent on room air.
At this hospital, EKG showed sinus tachycardia with a rate of [**Street Address(2) 33115**] depression in V5 through V6.
CT scan was reported as negative for PE or effusion.
However, chest x-ray showed extensive bilateral infiltrates.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 83 and no ST-T wave changes.
The patient has had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for 15-20 years and has been in persistent a-fib for approximately 7 months.
C5-C7 bilateral fracture status post cervical fusion.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Bilateral shoulder surgery.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities:  1 to 2 plus pitting edema with dopplerable distal pulses bilaterally.
Chest x-ray:  Findings could be consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema secondary to CHF superimposed on emphysema.
Alternately, could represent aspiration pneumonia.
There are bilateral patchy lower lobe opacities, predominantly in the right lower lobe.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Pulmonary:  On admission, severe flare of pneumonia in this patient with the elevated white count, fever and findings on chest x-ray.
This further could be consistent with a community-acquired pneumonia, aspiration, or ventilator-associated/nosocomial process.
They felt that he had not had an infectious etiology, but his pulmonary decompensation was most likely multifactorial with the main factors including congestive heart failure and severe underlying COPD.
Throughout the admission, the patient was treated for symptoms of congestive heart failure.
In addition, it was felt by Pulmonary that the patient had much more severe underlying COPD than previously recognized.
Atrial fibrillation status post ablation:  The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the admission.
His Coumadin was adjusted throughout the admission in light of alteration and metabolism by the antibiotics to maintain him within the therapeutic range.
Cardiac:  The patient was ruled out for MI on admission.
His troponins were elevated secondary to the recent ablation but had been trending down.
The left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated but regional ventricular wall motion was normal.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
No pericardial effusion.
Late in the admission, the patient developed chest pain radiating from his sternum to the back.
A CTA was obtained to rule out for PE, which was negative for pulmonary embolism on [**2114-3-25**].
They felt that the patient's symptoms were consistent with pericarditis, which is often seen following ablation.
The patient was incredibly reluctant to take nonsteroidals for his pain as he had an increase in his creatinine while on these medications in the past.
However, it became elevated following his CTA on [**2114-3-25**].
The patient was maintained in a soft collar while in bed and in a hard collar while ambulating.
Anemia:  The patient had intermittent anemia during the admission and was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells on [**2114-3-28**].
However, results of these would be more accurate when he was not in the midst of an acute illness.
His anemia and need for an outpatient colonoscopy will be followed up by his primary care physician.
Atrial fibrillation status post ablation.
Congestive heart failure.
