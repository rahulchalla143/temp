CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2122-5-3**] 9:11 PM IMPRESSION: A mild congestive failure with stable marked cardiomegaly.
Right Upper Ext ultrasound [**5-8**]: No DVT in the right upper extremity.
haziness of the perihilar regions is new consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
There is no pneumothorax.
If any, there is a small left pleural effusion.
TTE [**2122-5-21**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-40 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is partial mitral leaflet flail (anterior leaflet).
At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
At least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The heart remains markedly enlarged but failure is not currently seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 56F with chronic systolic CHF (EF 15%) from non-ischemic cardiomyopathy thought to be due to cocaine abuse, HTN, and morbid obesity admitted with decompensated heart failure and acute renal failure.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Patient triggered for hypotension on day of admission with SBP 80 requiring ICU stay, during which time PICC line was placed for access and pt was initiated on furosemide drip at 10mg/hr.
We repleted lytes aggressively, and pt was maintained on 1.5L fluid restriction as well as a low sodium diet.
In addition, no afterload reducing agents could be given as patient's BP would not tolerate it; thus isordil and hydralazine were held.
Her lisinopril and spirinolactone were being held in the setting of relatively low blood pressures; these agents will likely need to be restarted as an outpatient.
# h/o AVNRT & NSVT: Remained in NSR during admission with rare episodes of significant NSVT.
Patient had been evaluated by EP for ICD/PM placement, but she was not considered a candidate for pacemaker given her comorbidities & non compliance with medications and [**Hospital1 4314**].
Although her carvedilol has been held in the setting of hypotension and acute heart failure, it was restarted during CCU course.
# Acute renal failure: Likely hemodynamic due to poor forward flow given her depressed ejection fraction and continued diuresis.
Whe renal was consulted, it was recommended that she undergo CVVH for continued volume removal.
She did have a hypontensive episode into the 70s and there was concern that she may have ATN [**1-17**] hypotension; however urine sediment did not show muddy brown casts.
On the day of discharge, she complained of "gastritis" pain that improved with pepto bismol.
# Depression/anxiety: continued home regimen Celexa  # Hyponatremia: Patient had hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of significant diuresis.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Maalox 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Ten (10) ml PO three times a day as needed for heartburn.

Information regarding heart failure management and low sodium diet was reviewed and discussed with you.
Fluid Restriction: 1.5 liters  You were admitted with congestive heart failure with fluid overload.
Please call your primary doctor or come to the ED if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath or any other worrisome symptoms.
