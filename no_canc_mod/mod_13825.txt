There is a probable tiny additional area of restricted diffusion in the left parietal subcortical white matter.
[**Month/Day/Year **] are probably representative of acute brain ischemia.
The larger lesion correlates with the MR [**First Name (Titles) 56928**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4493**] of occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery approximately 1 cm from its origin.
Supposedly, there is a history of prior vertebral artery dissection, which might correlate with this finding.
As there are no preceding neural imaging studies available at this time for comparison, perhaps this was the site of the vertebral artery dissection stated in the history.
Lastly, there is a 1cm area of susceptibility noted within the region of the vallecula of the cerebellum.
Apparently, after discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the neurologist caring for the patient, there is a history of prior hemorrhage in this locale.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] consistent with acute brain ischemia involving the left temporal lobe anteriorly, left insula, and basal ganglia regions, with occlusion of the proximal left middle cerebral artery.
The selective injection of the left internal carotid artery demonstrated an occluded M2 segment.
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures.
There are areas of hypoattenuation within the anterior left temporal lobe and left basal ganglia including the left putamen, caudate and corona radiata consistent with subacute infarction.
IMPRESSION: Evolving infarction within the left middle cerebral artery distribution.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage after tPA infusion.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall  motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet  excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
6.The mitral valve appears structurally  normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt is a 66 year-old right-handed male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, history of vertebral artery dissection complicated by hemorrhage in setting of elevated INR, who presented with  acute brain ischemia involving the left temporal lobe anteriorly, left insula, and basal ganglia regions, with occlusion of the proximal left middle cerebral artery.
Given the pt's history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, this event was most certainly cardioembolic in origin.
Pt's initial deficits included a right flaccid hemiplegia and expressive aphasia.
He was started on warfarin as stroke was most certainly cardioembolic in origin due to underlying atrial fibrillation.
Follow-up CT scan one day after intra-arterial tPA showed no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct.
was able to tolerate both solids and liquids without restriction.
He was afebrile and had no symptoms suggestive of infection.
It is recommended that the pt undergo work-up for possible infection should the elevated white count persist or he develop symptoms.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: -ischemic stroke in left middle cerebral artery distribution -s/p intraarterial thrombolysis -atrial fibrillation  Discharge Condition: The pt.
was able to form and repeat [**3-9**] word sentences (transcortical motor aphasia), had resultant right-sided flaccid hemiplegia.
If you experience worsening of symptoms or new concerning symptoms, please call your primary care doctor, your neurologist, or come to the emergency department for evaluation.
