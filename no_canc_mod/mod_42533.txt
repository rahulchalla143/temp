Today he noticed increasing shortness of breath and activated EMS.
He was complaining of shortness of breath and left chest pain.
General:  Mild respiratory distress, able to speak in sentence fragments.
Facial bones were stable, no deformities.
Pulmonary: Trachea shifted to the right, no breath sounds on the left, crepitus laterally, good air entry on right, no crackles.
Abdomen:  No tenderness, no distention, soft.
The patient's cervical spine was intact, with no deformities.
The thoracic, lumbar and sacral spines were also without deformity.
Posterolateral ribs, approximately III to VIII showed no abrasions but ecchymoses.
X-ray on admission:  Large left pneumothorax, no visible rib fractures.
Repeat chest x-ray after chest tube:  No pneumothorax, lung up.
Urinalysis showed moderate blood.
Urine toxicology screen positive for opiates.
Blood toxicology screen was positive for aspirin.
The patient's abdominal examination remained unremarkable, and the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Serial chest x-rays on postoperative day number five showed a left lower lobe collapse with an effusion which had improved from admission.
The following hospital day, cultures grew out 4+ gram-positive cocci and 3+ gram-negative rods, at which time he was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin.
At that time, his white count came up to 13.3, and he was noted to have low-grade fevers at around 101.0.
On [**2157-11-5**], the Thoracic Surgery service was consulted in order to assist with the management of this patient's undrained effusions, which by chest x-ray had shown a persistent effusion that did not layer, which is consistent with loculated fluid collection.
The ultrasound done on the 14th was consistent with a moderate left effusion with blood and fibrin, again consistent with loculations.
The chest tube over the previous two days had had minimal drainage.
Based on the history and hospital course, Thoracic Surgery thought that the concern is for a blood collection in the left chest which would require thoracoscopy and decortication for evacuation and lung re-expansion.
There was an associated left lower lobe collapse and a consolidation.
There was a moderate left pleural effusion with probable areas of loculation superiorly.
Following this scan, it was thought by the Thoracic Surgery team that this study was consistent with a left hydropneumothorax with likely hemothorax.
The thinking was that a VATS with removal of all of the pleural debris would be a definitive clinical option.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2157-11-7**], where a VATS and decortication and a placement of a chest tube was completed.
His temperature subsequently decreased, and then x-ray done on [**2157-11-11**] showed that there was no evidence of pneumothorax, and there was a left lower lobe atelectasis and effusion, for which the patient was on continued incentive spirometry and chest physical therapy.
Status post pneumothorax complicated by loculated effusion 2.
Percocet one to two tablets by mouth every four to six hours as needed for severe pain  FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in two weeks.
