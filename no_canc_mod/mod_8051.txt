No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
2.No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No left ventricular aneurysm is seen.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with global hypokinesis especially of the anterior and inferoseptal walls.. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
5.There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is bileaflet retraction with moderate MAC.

There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
The mediastinal contours appear improved, but with a persistent postoperative appearance.
No region of consolidation is seen.
Pulmonary vascularity appears improved since the prior study.
