A few superficial ulcers ranging in size from 8mm to 5mm were found in the antrum and pre-pyloric region.
They had no stigmata suggestive of likely rebleeding.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 year old female with a remote history of breast cancer admitted [**2168-5-21**] with coffee ground emesis/melena.
EGD [**2168-5-22**] showed Barrett's esophagus and multiple non-bleeding gastric ulcers.
This drop was due to UGI bleed from gastric ulcers.
Leukocytosis: The patient had a leukocytosis (wbc 14) on admission, which likely represented an acute stress reaction in the setting of GI bleed, given that it resolved rapidly over the course of her hospital stay.
