History of Present Illness: 57 yo female w h/o known bicuspid aortic valve (x2yrs) presented to outside hospital following syncopal episode while walking to work.
Echo revealed critical aortic stenosis with AVA0.7cm2.
Cardiac cath confirmed critical AS and ruled out significant coronary disease.
She denies shortness of breath- but admittedly does not partake in a lot of physical activity.

A small secundum atrial septal defect is present.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Post second bypass there is a jet seen extending from the aortic root to the left atrium.
Despite third bypass run the jet extending from the aortic root to the left atrium persists.
Trivial mitral regurgitation persists.

She went into a rapid atrial fibrillation and was loaded with Amiodarone in the CVICU.
Coumadin was started for atrial fibrillation and mechanical AVR.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Upon discharge Zaroxyln was stopped and Lasix was changed to 40 mg po BID due to slight rise in BUN and creatinine.
By the time of discharge on POD 9 the patient was ambulating with assistance, she was tolerating a full oral diet, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with Ultram.
4. magnesium hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
5. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
