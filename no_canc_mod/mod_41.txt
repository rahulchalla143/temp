Patient reports that since discharge from the hospital on Saturday [**11-21**], she has had persistent increased sputum which she has difficulty coughing up.
She denies fever or chills.
She denies worsening dyspnea, but has only ambulated in her house as she hasn't been feeling well.
She endorses mild orthopnea.
She denies worsening lower extremity edema.
Of note, patient was recently admitted for hypoxia with CXR findings of a LUL.
She had presented to her cardiologist one week prior to initial admission with complaints of worsening dyspnea and increased sputum production, without fever or leukocytosis.
At that time, cardiologist felt that patient was having an acute flare of her chronic bronchitis, and placed her on a one week course of levofloxacin.
A CXR was performed at the time to rule out pneumonia which was negative for consolidation.
She continued to be afebrile without leukocytosis but reported no improvement in sputum production or dyspnea.
She was sent to the ER where a repeat CXR showed bilateral upper lobe opacities concerning for pneumonia.
Antibiotics were not continued as patient was afebrile, without cough or leukocytosis.
Right lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT.

Worsening multifocal opacification.
Recommend clinical correlation for infection, and in the absence of concern for infection, CT of the chest is recommended to exclude the possibility of malignancy.
Pulmonary artery enlargement compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Cardiomegaly and enlargement of the pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
No pulmonary edema.
Three discrete new irregularly-shaped focal opacities demonstrated within the left upper lobe that, given multiplicity and configuration, are likely related to an active infectious or inflammatory proces, much less likely to be synchronous bronchogenic carcinoma.
Differential also includes organizing pneumonia or pseudolymphoma.
Recommend followup to resolution with conventional radiographs in six weeks.
Moderate cardiomegaly and severe pulmonary hypertension have progressed since [**2135**].

Hospital course notable for acute renal failure.
#Hypoxia/Atypical Pneumonia/Pulmonary hypertension/Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease/Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure/Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Patient was initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with hypercarbic respiratory which was felt to be due to over oxygenation, and most likely worsening pulmonary hypertension from volume overload and atypical pneumonia.
She was also seen by the Pulmonary service for evaluation of her pulmonary hypertension and episodes of apnea and they recommended an outpatient sleep study.
Given that over-ventilation and over-oxygenation was felt to contribute to the patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence, the patient should have oxygen for a target oxygen saturation of 89-93%.
#Pulmonary nodules: Patient had sputum production and a chest CT which showed 3 left uppe lobe lung nodules that were most likely felt to be infectious.
Hospital course was notable for improvement in symptoms with diuresis, but complicated by acute renal failure (see below).
#Acute on Chronic renal Failure: During diuresis for acute heart failure, patient developed acute renal failure with probable contraction alkalosis.
# Hypertension: Blood pressure was well controlled on home regimen.
# Diabetes mellitus:  HgbA1c 6.5 in 7/[**2138**].
# Transitional issues: AFB cultures will need to be followed-up She will need close pulmonary follow-up for repeat imaging in several weeks (fu of pulmonary nodules as well as follow up of her likely COPD, severe pulmonary hypertension, and probable sleep apnea .

During your stay you received treatment for congestive heart failure and continued treatment for a possible pneumonia.
You will need to continue to restrict your salt intake in order to prevent exacerbations of your heart failure.
Additionally, there was significant concern that you have obstructive sleep apnea.
The following changes were made to your medication regimen: 1) START guaifenesin  100 mg/5 mL Syrup  Sig:  Ten (10) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sputum production/cough 2) START albuterol 0.083% neb solution, 1 nebulizer every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing 3) You may use saline nasal spray as needed for nasal dryness.
