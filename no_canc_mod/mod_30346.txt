Likely not sepsis, given HR 55 and no localizing source.
No evidence of PNA or UTI.
Hypotension, as well as cardiogenic shock, are listed as adverse reactions to mexilitine overdose.
The acuity of onset of her symptoms would suggest ingestion and not sepsis.
Could be addisonian crisis given slightly elevated eos, hyperkalemia and mild hyponatremia, already received 10mg dexamethasone.
Given degree of bradycardia at time of ED presentation, could consider nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] ingestion but could also have been vagal episode if post-ictal.
#Altered mental status: Likely secondary to high clonazepam dosing in light of liver failure, exacerbated by hypotension and drug side effect of mexilitine.
# UTox (+) Amphetamine: Can be a false positive due to klonipin, or other unreported OTC medication.
Hyperkalemia, along with mild hyponatremia.
Possible hypoadrenalism considered in ICU, but random cotrisol level within normal limits, and no other probable association.
No evidence of acute liver failure as INR and bilirubin normal.

You understand that you have liver toxicity very likely related to you medications and low blood pressure component on hospital arrival (also medication induced), and that this requires cessation of particular meds, adjustment of dosage of other meds, and that blood work needs to be followed up this week by your physicians.
