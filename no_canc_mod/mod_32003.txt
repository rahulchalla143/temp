Admitted to the OSH on [**3-5**] with shortness of breath, he was initially treated with Levaquin and Cetriaxone along with steroids for COPD as this was felt to be most consistent with a COPD exacerbation.
Given CT findings consistent with pulmonary fibrosis, thoracic surgery was consulted and on [**3-14**] a bronchoscopy with washings, RVATS RUL lung biopsy was performed.
Per the OSH notes, he appeared to have respiratory failure on [**3-15**] with a PaO2 of 58.
Worsening was felt to be due to CHF and hebwas diuresed with IV lasix.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2198-4-1**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2198-4-4**]):    NO GROWTH.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2198-3-28**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Retrocardiac opacity may represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
Small left pleural effusion.
Limited study due to respiratory motion.
There is an increase of the retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms, suggestive of atelectasis.
No pneumothorax.
[**2198-3-29**] Peritoneal fluid cytology:  	NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right-sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 16 mmHg, mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 35/19 mmHg, and elevated left ventricular filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 20 mmHg.
Oximetry run did not demonstrate any evidence of left-to-right shunting.
This would suggest mild right-to-left intracardiac shunting.
However, inability to directly measure a PV saturation and the clinical suspicion for intrapulmonary shunting challenges these calculations.
High-output state suggestive of sepsis or systemic vasodilation of another etiology.
Biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
No evidence of left-to-right shunt.
Possible mild right-to-left intracardiac shunting.
[**2198-3-29**] CT head w/o contrast - CONCLUSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.
No abnormal enhancement.
No central pulmonary embolism.
If clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism is high, a V/Q scan should be obtained.
Bibasilar consolidation, mostly on the left, could be due to multifocal pneumonia or aspiration.
Heterogeneous attenuation, could be due to air trapping.
Cirrhosis and ascites.
No evidence for retroperitoneal or other hematoma.
Moderate simple abdominal and pelvic ascites.
Nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.
Diffuse pancreatic calcifications with atrophy suggestive of chronic pancreatitis.
Bilateral avascular necrosis of the femoral heads without collapse.
Bibasilar consolidations concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
Nonobstructive renal calculi with bilateral renal cysts.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
[**2198-3-31**] CXR - FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube terminates 6.4 cm above carina and could be advanced slightly for standard positioning.
Persistent mild fluid overload.
Slight improvement in airspace consolidation in left lower lobe, possibly due to an infectious pneumonia.
Persistent small left pleural effusion.
[**2198-3-31**] CXR - Widespread pulmonary opacification developed in both lungs in addition to the previous consolidation in the left lower.
Findings consistent with edema or hemorrhage in addition superimposed on left lower lobe pneumonia.
Azygos engorgement and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette suggest a component of cardiac decompensation or volume overload but that may not explain all the new findings.
Left jugular and right PIC lines both end in the mid SVC.
No pneumothorax.
[**2198-4-1**] CXR - Generalized pulmonary opacification probably combination of edema and pneumonia, particularly in the left lower lobe has worsened since [**3-31**].
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
Component of pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
No pneumothorax.
[**2198-4-1**] CXR - Sequence of pulmonary abnormalities on chest radiographs since [**3-28**], suggests the development of pneumonia, particularly in left lower lobe, followed by evidence of volume overload and most recently worsening generalized pulmonary opacification which could be due to a combination of edema and hemorrhage, showing particular worsening over the past five hours.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 80664**] is a 65 year old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD admitted to an OSH with SOB who was transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia.
Hypoxia / Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated shortly after arrival due to hypoxia, altered mental status, and the need to safely perform multiple studies and procedures.
Initially many possible explanations for hypoxia were entertained and likely several of them contributed to his presentation.
CTA showed no central large PE, but was a limited study.
There was concern raised at the OSH for intrinsic lung disease and history of IPF, however, the patient's CXR did not show evidence of significant IPF.
Biopsies from the OSH were unobtainable as they had been sent to [**State **] for further evaluation.
The patient subsequently became hypotensive and died shortly thereafter despite aggressive support with pressors and maximum ventilatory support.
Hypotension: The patient initially required levophed for blood pressure support and to help maintain O2 sats following admission and intubation.
He became bradycardic and had a cardiac arrest.
They recommended continued platelet transfusion with ABO-matched platelets.
They felt that some underlying consumptive process was responsible.
The patient was already on steroids for COPD and hematology felt that ITP was unlikely.
On [**3-30**] vancomycin was stopped, on [**3-31**] zosyn was stopped, and on [**3-31**] his PPI was changed to ranitidine in the event that the patient had thrombocytopenia as a result of a drug reaction.
Cirrhosis: Per the OSH notes, the patient had alcoholic cirrhosis.
He had a low albumin and somewhat elevated INR as well as splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia.
Given the patient's altered mental status, he was treated with lactulose and rifaximin for possible hepatic encephalopathy.
The patient also underwent a diagnostic paracentesis without evidence of SBP.
His anemia was likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH), GIB (guaiac + at the OSH).
Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status was most likely multifactorial with hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, hypoxia, and infection all contributing.
He had a head CT that was negative for any acute process.
This problem resolved quickly following admission with fluid resuscitation.
Renal failure: The patient had a baseline creatinine at the OSH of ~1.0.
The transient elevationwas likely secondary to a pre-renal state and GI bleeding.
His diarrhea was most likely secondary to lactulose.
