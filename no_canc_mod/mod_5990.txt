Admission Date:  [**2102-9-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-9-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-11-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Clindamycin / Ceftazidime  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4219**] Chief Complaint: Increased secretions and SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Rigid bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness:  54 y/o female with PMH sig for tracheal stenosis s/p multiple dilations, recent [**Hospital1 18**] admission [**2102-6-16**] during which a T-Tube was placed.
She had a flexible bronchoscopy in [**Month (only) 216**] [**2101**] showing a significant amount of granulation tissue build-up.
On advancing to the distal limb of the T-tube, it was noted that the patient had a significant amount of granulation tissue build-up but leaving an approximately 6-mm airway.
It was noted that distal to this build-up of granulation tissue, the patient had patent distal airways.
Pt presented on this admission with increased tracheal secretions and DOE over prior 2 days.
No SOB @ rest.
Pt admitted to MICU where flex bronch revealed severe tracheal narrowing (4mm) at the distal end of the T-tube.
No hemoptysis.
Pt underwent rigid bronch with placement of tracheal stent and was started on Levaquin for tracheitis.
Pt now with no complaints and states that she feels much better.
Still has productive cough which is near baseline.
Past Medical History: 1.  tracheal stenosis - pt is s/p multiple dilatations 2.  tracheal bronchitis 3.  depression - no meds currently 4.  h/o anxiety 5.
Type 2 DM - diagnosed 3-5 years ago, reports glucose usually 130s 6.  hypertension - diagnosed 3-5 years ago 7.  hypothyroidism - on Synthroid 8.  anemia 9.
GERD 10.  hypercholesterolemia   Social History: Lives with care provider and her family, since [**2101-7-17**].
Neck JVP flat; white secrections coming from trach tube, minimal erythema around trach.
Chest: CTAB, no stridor.
CVS: tachycardic, regular without mrg Abd: soft, NABS, NT/ND Extrem: No edema, ecchymosis on RLE.
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
It is uncertain whether this is due to granulation tissue and/or retained secretions.
Disruption of the posterior wall of the tracheal stent in its inferior portion.
Patchy ground-glass opacities within the right apex and superior segment of the left lower lobe, most likely due to infection or aspiration.
Although the observed findings are most likely due to granulation tissue, tumor involvement cannot be fully excluded and direct correlation with findings at bronchoscopy is therefore suggested.
Bronchoscopy: High grade fibrosis beneath the inferior part of tracheostomy tube.
Squamous metaplasia with regenerative epithelial change.
Acute and chronic inflammation with ulceration.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 26280**] is a 54 y/o female with h/o tracheal stenosis s/p T-tube placement, Type 2 DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, who presented with increasing stridor and bronchoscopy showing 4 mm luminal narrowing distal to T-tube.
Tracheal Narrowing: Shortness of breath was likely due to granulation tissue and inflammation seen at old tracheal stent site, as well as increased secretions.
Increased tracheal secretions: This was believed to be secondary to tracheitis, given the elevated white count and left shift on admission.
Sputum culture revealed strep pneumonia.
The pt was continued on her inhaled steroids and nebulizers with good effect and dyspnea resolved.
Anemia: The pt has a history of anemia per records, but no clear work up.
Iron studies ewre drawn and are likely consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1)  Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Diagnosis: tracheal stenosis tracheobronchitis   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Please take all of your usual medications.
Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 14680**] office for fever, shortness of breath, chest pain or questions.
Call Interventional Pulmonology if problems arise.
