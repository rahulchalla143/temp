On [**2140-4-16**], she was at dialysis when her groin wound spontaneously started oozing blood.
The bleeding was successfully stopped with lidocaine with epi and surgifoam.
Her wound was examined by ACS who repacked the wound and recommended admission for further evaluation.
A duplex ultrasound demonstrated a small 1.4 x 1.2 cm pseudoaneurysm likely originating from an epigastric arterial branch.
Over the course of the  next week, she developed recurrent bleeding into her right thigh with associated anemia and hypotension.
A CT was performed confirming  a the fistula emanating from the femoral profunda and possibly from branches off the common femoral with distended femoral vein and multiple dilated venous branches extending into her pannus and into her vulvar region consistent with her presentation of bleeding episodes from her groin wounds.
She therefore underwent a right groin exploration with take down of right common femoral and right profunda artery arteriovenous fistulas on [**2140-4-26**].
The procedure was without complications although she did have a 4500cc blood loss requiring 6 liters crystalloid, 6 units packed red blood cells, 2 units FFP, 1150 cc Cell [**Doctor Last Name **].
On POD 6, she developed erythema and drainage from her groin incision.
The wound culture eventually grew klebsiella and proteus.
The wound was assessed daily and debided as needed.
As she no longer needs debridement, and the wound has started to granulate, she is ready for discharge.
