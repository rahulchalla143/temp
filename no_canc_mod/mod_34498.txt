PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST: Left chest tube has been removed with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Lungs are grossly clear without focal consolidation.
No large pleural effusions are identified.
No pneumothorax identified.
INDICATION: 49-year-old man status post ascending aorta repair with post- operative CVA.
There is no prior MRI for comparison.
There is a large area of abnormal signal intensity representing high signal on FLAIR imaging in the right PCA distribution, representing subacute right PCA infarct.
On diffusion-weighted images, there are evidence of restricted diffusion in the right PCA territory including right occipital lobe as well as the right superior cerebellar territory.
The area of slow effusion now also seen in the right thalamus, mid brain and cerebral peduncle as well as pulvinar of the thalamus.
There are small foci of restricted diffusion in the left occipital lobe as well as left cerebral hemisphere.
The involvement of the contralateral side suggests embolic event.
There is slight enhancement in the involved area of right PCA distribution which could represent luxury perfusion.
Right posterior cerebral artery is not visualized representing occlusion or thrombosis, causing stroke.
Right superior cerebellar artery is not clearly identified either.
Large area of subacute infarct with slow diffusion involving right PCA and right superior cerebellar territory.
Small foci of slow diffusion in the left occipital lobe and cerebellum, suggestive of embolic events.
Slow diffusion also involves mid brain and thalamus.
Aortic valve disease.

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly depressed LVEF.
Conclusions No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %) with mild global hypokinesis.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The ascending aorta and aortic arch show no evidence of thrombus or dissection.
The left subclavian artery ostium is visualized, which also shows no evidence of thrombus.
The innominate artery and left common carotid artery ostium is not visualized.
There is a new aortic valve prosthesis in place on the current study.
IMPRESSION: Mild global LV hypokinesis with a properly functioning mechanical aortic valve prosthesis.
No evidence of dissection or thrombus in the aortic graft or descending aorta.
He was given 48 hours of peroperative vancomycin as he was in house for greater than 24 hours preop and he is allergic to penicillin.
He was found to be agitated, with left sided weakness the night after surgery, CT head revealed a right PCA stroke.
A left chest tube was placed on [**11-29**] for pneumothorax.
