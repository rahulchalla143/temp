In brief this a 56 year old female h/o ESRD on HD (MWF), DM2, who was admitted with acute respiratory failure, s/p 2 PEA arrests in the ED and with acute MI s/p DES X2.

There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall and septum and distal inferior dyskinesis.
There is mild-moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 30 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive regional and global systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis and mid to distal anteroseptal hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-10-18**], left ventricular systolic function is now improved (particularly anteroseptal and apical motion).
New moderately severe pulmonary edema.
[**10-18**] ECG: Probable sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contractions.
Anterolateral ST segment depressions which may be due to ischemia.
Possible ST segment elevation, one millimeter in leads III and aVF.
Cannot exclude ongoing inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Q wave in lead III and non-diagnostic Q wave in leads aVF which may be due to prior inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2156-8-27**] ST segment elevations in lead III and aVF are new.
Lateral ST segment depressions are also new.
[**2156-10-24**]: Left Upper Extremity Doppler U/S Occlusive thrombus within the caudal portion of the left internal jugular vein, as seen previously.
There is no extension of thrombus into the deep veins of the left upper extremity.
No contrast flow noted from the AV graft into the venous outflow tract.
Unsuccessful attempts of thrombolysis at the right upper extremity AV graft.
Uncomplicated placement of a new 12 French 16 cm temporary hemodialysis catheter with VIP port through the right internal jugular vein.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 96136**] is a 56 year old woman with h/o ESRD on HD (MWF), DM2, who was admitted with acute respiratory failure and who had 2 PEA arrests in the ED.
s/p cardiac arrest/NSTEMI: There was concern for ACS, given EKG changes and elevated troponin, despite her end-stage renal disease.
Echo showed new anterior hypokinesis and global worsening of systolic function.
Prior to discharge she reported a history of myalgias with multiple different statins (not listed on medication allergies).
Upon review of atrius records there was a mild elevation of CPK in [**2149**] the setting of myalgias however no evidence of rhabdomyolysis.
In addition the patient's PCP should trend CPK regularly and d/c the medication if concerning elevation or symptoms.
Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient with acute hypoxic respiratory failure morning of admission while on her way to dialysis.
Exam, CXR, and history all consistent with fluid overload.
This was almost definitely triggered by ACS with worsening systolic function.
Her dialysis fistula had no thrill and seemed clotted (similar to [**2-/2156**]), so a temporary HD line was placed on arrival to the MICU.
After cardiac cath, she was extubated without difficulty.
She will follow-up outpatient in approximately 6 weeks for consideration of surgical thrombectomy once she has stabilized from a cardiac standpoint.
Abdominal pain: Patient had abdominal pain on the evening prior to admission with radiation to lower back.
Given that patient is asymptomatic, the decision was made not to anticoagulate for the time being, as the patient is already on Aspirin and Plavix and therefore high bleeding risk.
Acute Systolic Heart Failure (EF 30% on admission, later improved to 45%): likely caused by acute MI.
These were discontinued and she was started on metoprolol succinate and lisinopril to optimize heart failure management .
# LUE erythema in antecubital fossa: This developed after admission and is most likely cellulitis related to previous IV placement.
U/S was negative for abscess.
CHRONIC ISSUES =============== #.
- Patient with history of myalgias on statins in the past but with strong indication for statin therapy given recent MI.
PCP should trend CPK regularly and d/c medication if concerning elevation or symptoms.
- Abdominal Pain may be patient's anginal equivalent as she never had chest pain with her MI.

You were admitted to the hospital because you were feeling short of breath.
It appears what happened was that you had a heart attack on Sunday night prior to your admission.
These blockages were likely what caused your heart attack.
There are many things that you can do to reduce your risk of having another heart attack.
You also developed a skin infection (cellulitis) in your left arm.
If you have fever or your arm does not improve you should call your primary care doctor.
