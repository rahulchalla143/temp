Imaging: CXR [**2184-9-25**]: mild bibasilar atelectasis .
MR of head, MRA of head and neck,  [**2184-9-28**] FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of infarct or hemorrhage.
There are scattered T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which are nonspecific but could be seen as the sequelae of chronic microangiopathy.
There is no mass, midline shift, or hydrocephalus.
A small amount of fluid is visualized in the mastoid air cells.
MRA BRAIN:  There is irregularity of the cavernous internal carotid arteries due to atheromatous disease.
The left M1 and bilateral M2 segments exhibit narrowing and irregularity likely atheromatous disease.
There is no evidence of aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation.
There is mild narrowing of the proximal right internal carotid artery.
The diameter of the proximal carotid arteries is larger than the distal diameter, therefore, there is no stenosis by NASCET criteria.
No evidence of infarction or hemorrhage.
Mild narrowing of the cavernous carotid arteries, likely related to atherosclerotic disease.
No aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the inferior wall, basal to mid inferolateral wall, distal septal wall, and apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 8 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
Focal regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel CAD.
Right ventricular dilation and dysfunction.
Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-7-19**], more extensive regional dysfunction is present with a decline in ejection fraction.
There is a gradient across the mitral valve consistent with functional mitral stenosis.
Severe diffuse three vessel coronary artery disease with subtotal occlusion of heavily calcified diffusely diseased RCA 2.
Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension with severe right ventricular diastolic heart failure on pressor.
Moderate left ventricular diastolic heart failure.
Cardiogenic shock with SBP ranging from 60 mm Hg off pressor to 180 mm Hg (with excellent cardiac index) on pressor(norepinephrine) 5.
As this is [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 26900**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] NOT advanced to PCW position or inflate balloon without fluoroscopic guidance.
CCU team to evaluate the benefits and risks of RCA rotational atherectomy and stenting given echocardiographic and hemodynamic evidence of RV failure, but heavily calcified and diffusely diseased RCA.
Findings consistent with bilateral abnormal renal arterial circulation.
No evidence of venous thrombosis.
No stones or hydronephrosis.
Right pleural effusion.
2.75 mm balloons.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and 30% residual ostial stent recoil in the RCA and 30% residual stenosis in the mid vessel RCA.
The distal RCA had diffuse unchanged disease.
VENOUS DUPLEX UPPER EXTREMITY [**2184-10-6**] Duplex evaluation was performed of both upper extremities.
Brief Hospital Course: 78F PMH of type I DM (complicated by nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy), CKD (baseline Cr 2.0) and recent inferior NSTEMI in [**6-/2184**] who presentd with recurrent syncope [**1-29**] to short episdoes of asystole.
Acute issues: # Bradycardia/Asystole/Syncope: Patient admitted following multiple syncopal episodes preceded by nausea and retching.
After admission to CCU, continued to have episodes of bradycardia to the 30s-40s with associated hypotension.
These were often but not exclusively related to nausea and vomiting.
Concern for recurrent inferior MI but troponins and CK-MB initially stable.
Initially thought to be most likely secondary to elevated vagal tone, but patient had progressive hypotension and bradycardia as hospitalization progressed (see below NSTEMI).
Episodes of syncope resolved later in hospitalization, with no events of significant symptomatic pauses noted on tele.
She did have several episodes of bradycardia to the 30s but was asymptomatic during these events.
# Hypotention/Shock: Shock appeared cardiogenic in nature on cath study but sepsis was highly considered given low SVR.
On day 2 of admission, patient became hypotensive to the 60s-80s systolic, associated with bradycardia.
Patient also developed intermittant fevers, so concern for sepsis.
[**12-31**] blood cultures grew gram positive cocci on [**8-26**].
Lactate 3.1 on [**9-27**], likely due to hypoperfusion with low blood pressures, and eventually normalized below 2 on repeat measurements.
Patient with low temperature and restarted on zosyn.
Patient was on lasix gtt to decrease preload for cardiogenic shock and this was discontinued when CVP goal of [**10-8**] was reached.
# Mental status changes: Patient with intermittant episodes of unresponsiveness associated with hypotension, concerning for seizure vs hypoperfusion.
The first of these occurred following dose of Phenergan and was associated with muscle rigidity, attributed to medication reaction.
Also had periods of hallucinations, picking at bedclothes, confusion more consistent with acute delirium.
MRI and MRA of head/neck showed no infarct, just atherosclerotic disease in cavernous carotid arteries.
EEG showed no seizure activity.
Concern for encephalitis given low grade fevers, so LP done which was unremarkable and viral PCR negative.
# Anuric Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Urine output decreased to <10cc/hr on second day of admission.
FENa <1%, but no improvement in UOP with fluid boluses or initiation of pressors.
Pt also with anion gap metabolic acidosis which was most likely related to uremia and lactic acidosis.
In addition, delta/delta revealed underlying non gap metabolic acidosis which could be related to RTA secondary to diabetes.
Renal consult suggested renal U/S, urine lytes and urine eosinophils.
Renal u/s showed R renal artery parvus tardus suggestive of renal artery stenosis and poor diastolic flow bilaterally.
Cath study on [**10-3**] did not show impressive stenosis of renal arteries and no interventions were done.
Urine lytes were consistent with ATN and urine eosinophils were negative and thus made interstitial nephritis related to cephalosporins (history of allergy) less likely.
# CAD: Initially inferior wall STD + TWI similar to ECG changes at the time of NSTEMI 2 months ago, but cardiac enzymes stable, no chest pain.
Pt had troponinemia on [**9-29**] that peaked at 3.89 and cath study showed 3VD - this was concluded to be demand NSTEMI presentation.
# Nausea/Vomiting: most likely [**1-29**] to her chronic diabetic gastroparesis but could also be manifestation of inferior myocardial ischemia.
Obstructive biliary issue is also on the ddx given RUQ US showed cholelithiasis.
The patient continued to have nausea and emesis intermitently throughout course.
Low dose ativan was used to control nausea given reactions to other medications as above.
# Nutrition: Patient with poor PO intake on admission.
Tube feeds were initiated on [**10-2**] but rate could not be advanced given high residual volume due to gastroparesis.
# ischemic cardiomyopathy: post NSTEMI echo in [**6-/2184**] showed inf wall hypokinesis and LVEF 45%.
NYHA class I-II.
ECHO on this admission showed decreased LVEF to 35-40% likely secondary to additional cardiac insult this admission.
Diuretics were stopped on [**10-11**] secondary to low BPs and dry volume status.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated on presentation but with normal FT4.
Transitional issues: # Dialysis follow-up # Cardiology follow-up # Renal follow-up # Patient's goal hematcrit should be >30% given her NSTEMI during this admission.
