For his pneumonia, for which he began treatment on his previous admission, an endotracheal sputum (stain/cx) sample was found to be had positive for h. influenza.
Because he was also found to have a pleural effusion, and collapse of his right lower lobe, part of the differential was pulmonary embolus.
Upper extremity ultrasound of his left arm showed an extensive, canalized clot.
On [**2154-9-19**], he had a fever spike which was attributed to his pneumovax and flu vaccines given [**9-18**].
He was afebrile for 36 hrs, and again spiked a fever to 103.
Chest x-ray at the time was clear and pan-culture (blood/urine/sputum as well as a wound culture) were sent.
By [**2154-9-17**], he was tolerating extended periods of pressure support ventilation with short periods on trach collar.
For his quadraplegia, during a previous admission (on [**2154-8-26**]) the patient had a vertebral fusion of C1-C7 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] of Neurosurgery.
Despite being in an air bed, Mr. [**Known lastname 56636**] was found to stage II decubitus ulcers on his buttox which were dressed with duoderm.
He did not tolerate lying on his side and it was felt being out of bed in the chair would worsen the ulcers.
His bed was changed to a more advanced [**Doctor First Name **]-air bed that could also perform chest pt and repositioning.
While patient has a distant history of oxycodone dependence, the methadone is not for opiate withdrawal but for his chronic lower back and now neck pain.
Iron studies showed a mixed picture but his hematocrit remained stable 27-30% throughout his course here.
Speech and swallow evaluation determined he could swallow however, a PO diet was not given due to the amount of mechanical ventilation.
Once he uses pressure support or trach collar more regularly, he will likely tolerate some of a PO diet.
For decubitus ulcer prevention, the patient was kept in an air bed.
Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for secretions.
Diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for insomnia .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory failure Pneumonia quadriplegia   Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Please seek medical attention for fevers>101 or anything else medically concerning.
