[**2127-7-1**]: Dynamic flexible bronchoscopy.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old gentleman with a history of COPD who was found to have severe tracheobronchomalacia.
Unfortunately, he did suffer a stent-related infection and this needed to be removed.
We spoke at length at the utility of moving on to a surgical correction of his malacia with posterior splinting with Marlex mesh.
We talked about the risks of this procedure including injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, tracheal injury, esophageal injury, vessel, heart, or diaphragmatic injury.
We talked about the risks of pneumonia or other infection as a result of this, as well as the possibility of postoperative pain from the thoracotomy.
We also talked about the possibility that the cervical trachea may develop or may present with symptomatic malacia which would not be corrected by this intrathoracic procedure.
Finally, we discussed the possibility of improvement of the malacia without betterment of his symptoms despite the stent trial findings, if his underlying lung disease were to take precedence.
