On presentation he complained of vision loss in the right eye.
He underwent an emergent lateral canthotomy of his right eye for elevated intraocular pressures and concern for retrobulbar hematoma (IOP 50-90 pre-procedure, 38-41 after).
He went to the OR for emergent tracheostomy and soft tissue wash-out/exploration and completion of right eye lateral canthotomy by plastic surgery.

CT facial ([**2116-4-13**]) - Complex extensive facial fractures with combination Le [**Location 59383**] on the right and Le Fort I on the left with additional comminuted fractures of the maxillary sinus walls and lateral left orbital wall.
Abnormal contour of the right globe with apparent tethering/attenuation of the optic nerve and proptosis in the setting of retrobulbar hematoma.
Given the history of blindness from the right eye, this is concerning for optic nerve injury.
Extensive soft tissue swelling and foreign bodies in the premandibular and periorbital region as detailed.
CT Head ([**2116-4-13**]) - Foci of pneumocephalus in the right frontotemporal region, adjacent to the right orbital fractures.
Small extra-axial hemorrhage in the right frontal region.
No significant mass effect.
Right globe deformity and multiple facial fractures, better detailed on CT facial bones from the same day.
CT Cspine ([**2116-4-13**]) - No acute fracture or malalignment.
Foci of air within the spinal canal at the level of C2, likely inferior tracking of pneumocephalus.
CT A/P ([**2116-4-13**]) - No acute abdominal or pelvic process.
No fracture or malalignment of the thoracolumbar spine.

We kept the head of his bed elevated and used an ice pack to help with this.
Plastics: His facial fractures were assessed by the plastic surgery service.
He was given one dose of 20mg IV lasix on [**4-15**] in an attempt to decrease his facial swelling.
Pulm: He underwent an awake tracheostomy on [**4-13**] due to his severe facial swelling and for airway protection.
Any enteral access via a dophoff tube or a NGT was felt to be contraindicated secondary to his facial fractures.
He was treated with subcutaneous heparin and a prophylactic dose.
