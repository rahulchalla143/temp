She reports that she was taking furosemide and spirinolactone for her CHF but this was making her feel weak.
She couldn't sleep last night with worsening shortness of breath when lying down.
She came in because she couldn't get an appoinment with her PCP fast enough and felt that her shortness of breath was worsening.
She becomes short of breath just walking from the bed to the bathroom with her cane.
She denies any cough, sore throat, fevers, or chills, and does not complain of chest pain or palpitations.
Currently, she has no acute complaints.
She feels somewhat short of breath at rest adn tired but says that is similar to her usual state.

Imaging: [**2197-3-21**] Trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE):         No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
There are three, moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets with no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with mild mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No SEC or thrombus in the atria.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
[**2197-3-20**] V/Q Scan IMPRESSION: Matched decreased counts in the left lower lung likely due to cardiomegaly.
Low likelihood ratio for acute pulmonary embolism.
[**2197-3-19**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
[**2197-3-16**] Trans-thoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.
No significant valvular abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 15352**] is an 81 yo F with h/o diastolic congestive heart failure presents with one day of fatigue, dypnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.
# Chronic Heart Failure Exacerbation: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea (on CPAP) who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion despite Lasix titration as an outpatient.
On admission, she was found to have evidence of volume overload with an elevated JVP, bilateral crackles on lung exam, lower extremity edema, and new atrial flutter.
TTE showed EF 60%, RV dilatation with hypokinesis, indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
She was diuresed with IV Lasix with improvement of her dyspnea, lower extremity edema, pulmonary crackles, and elevated JVP.
She continues to be slightly volume overloaded and was discharged on an increased dose of Lasix 160 mg daily (from prior dose of 120 mg daily) for continued diuresis.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  The patient has a history of obesity-hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea (on CPAP at home) who reported progressive somnolence over the past several weeks prior to presentation.
She was likely becoming progressively hypercarbic as an outpatient due to progressive retention, as she was dozing off without cpap during the day and was also being diuresed with increasing levels of serum bicarb from contraction alkalosis, which may have further decreased her repiratory drive.
Also contributing was the fact that the patient was placed on supplemental oxygen in the ED, which further led to a decrease in her respiratory drive.
She did well until [**3-18**] when she developed somnolence after dozing off without bipap during the day and in the setting of continued diuresis.
The following morning ([**3-19**]), the patient was still drowsy and somnolent, and another ABG showed worsening of her hypercarbia (7.33/94/88 on 2L nc) so she was transferred back to the MICU for further management.
She was placed on Bipap with improvement, and had her settings adjusted to the following with good results:      Inspiratory pressure 9, Expiratory pressure 6, supplemental oxygen 1-4L titrated to goal PO2 88-92% She remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint without recurrence of somnolence on these bipap settings overnight, and was discharged with Bipap and pulmonary follow-up.
# Atrial flutter:  The patient presented with new atrial flutter in 4:1-3:1 block, likely secondary to her acute diastolic heart failure exacerbation.
After multiple days of diuresis on IV Lasix, it was thought that her fluid status would improve if she was in sinus rhythm so a flutter ablation was performed.
TEE did not show signs of any thrombus.
The patient underwent an ablation while in the MICU and was also cardioverted during the procedure for progressive pulmonary edema during the ablation.
Chest pain:  The patient developed chest pain at rest on the floor of similar nature as episodes she had experienced as an outpatient.
Troponin levels were slighlty elevated (0.17) but CK and MB (5) were normal.
While in the ICU, a V/Q scan did not reveal PE and cardiology was consulted for her atrial flutter.
Elevated troponins were likely due to volume overload and chronic heart failure in the setting of acute renal failure.
# Hypertension:  She was initially on Atenolol, spirinolactone, and furosemide as an outpatient.
Her SBP was persistently elevated in-house in 150s-160s and she was started on losartan for additional blood pressure control and potential heart failure benefits.
As stated above, her Atenolol was switched to Metoprolol while she was in atrial flutter.
Her blood pressures subsequently were improved but still mildly elevated (130's-150's).
She will need to have electrolytes checked for monitoring of her K+ and Mg2+, as well serum bicarb, as a progressively increasing bicarb may lead to compensatory respiratory alkalosis and cause hypercarbia.
# Acute renal failure: Initial Cr was elevated (1.4) likely in the setting of poor forward flow and renal hypoperfusion secondary to CHF exacerbation.
Patient had flank pain and hematuria briefly in the MICU that cleared subsequently.
She was transiently on Atorvastatin during her episode of chest pain, which was switched back to her home Simvastatin prior to discharge.
# Osteoarthritis: Pain control with tylenol PRN as needed.
14. potassium chloride 10 mEq Capsule, Extended Release Sig: [**1-2**] Capsule, Extended Releases PO as directed as needed for hypokalemia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 537**]- [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure Exacerbation Atrial Flutter Obstructive Sleep Apnea Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and weakness.
You were found to have an acute heart failure exacerbation with excess fluid in your body, which was removed with IV Lasix.
Your respiratory symptoms improved, and you will be discharged on a higher dose of Lasix for continued fluid regulation at home.
You were also found to be in an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial flutter.
