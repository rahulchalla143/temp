CT [**Last Name (un) **]/PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2159-6-19**]): Diffuse mucosal thickening of the [**Month/Day/Year 499**] is consistent with C. diff colitis.
There are no findings of obstruction or perforation.
Trace free fluid in the pelvis and at the dome of the liver.
KUB ([**2159-6-20**]): Colonic mural contour suggestive of wall edema, as seen on recent CT, consistent with patient's diagnosis of colitis, without evidence for megacolon.
KUB ([**2159-6-25**]): Stable colonic wall thickening consistent with the given history of c. diff colitis.
FLEXIBLE SIGMOIDOSCOPY ([**2159-6-29**]): -Mucosa: Diffuse erythema and congestion were noted in the rectum, sigmoid [**Month/Day/Year 499**] and descending [**Month/Day/Year 499**].
Diffuse continuous ulceration, friability, erythema, congestion, hemorrhages and pseudomembrane with contact bleeding were noted in the transverse [**Month/Day/Year 499**].
These findings are compatible with Severe colitis.
-Impression: Erythema and congestion in the rectum, sigmoid [**Month/Day/Year 499**] and descending [**Month/Day/Year 499**].
Ulceration, friability, erythema, congestion, hemorrhages and pseudomembrane in the transverse [**Month/Day/Year 499**] compatible with Severe colitis (biopsy).
[**Month/Day/Year **] BIOPSIES: pathology pending on discharge  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 87472**] is a 56 yo woman with h/o recurrent C. diff s/p fecal transplant ([**7-/2158**]), IBS and GERD who presented with diarrhea, abdominal pain and sinus tachycardia found to have severe C diff pancolitis.
# C. DIFF PANCOLITIS: Initial labs showed leukocytosis 28.3 with bandemia, CT [**Last Name (un) 103**] showed diffuse colonic mucosal thickening without e/o megacolon, C. diff assay positive.
In the MICU, patient was started on high-dose Vanco 500mg PO q6 hrs and Flagyl 500mg IV q8 hrs in light of her severe recurrent C diff.
She required high doses of IV narcotis for pain control, and received aggressive IV fluid due to severe diarrhea and resultant tachycardia.
Her abdominal pain and leukocytosis improved moderately, at which point she was transferred to medical floor.
On the floor, she had ongoing pain requiring frequent narcotics and was still having 8 stools per day.
On discharge, patient's stool frequency had decreased to 4 per day and her abdominal pain was continuing to improve.
# HEMATOCHEZIA: Patient's HCT drifted down over the course of hospitalization, from 43 on admission to 26 on discharge.
However, she also c/o BRBPR when on the floor.
To rule out possibility of co-existing infectious, inflammatory or ischemic colitis, flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed on [**6-29**].
It showed diffuse continuous ulceration, friability, erythema, hemorrhages and pseudomembranes with contact bleeding, c/w severe C diff colitis.
Findings explained likely etiology of her BRBPR.
BRBPR resolved without intervention and HCT stabilized.
# SINUS TACHYCARDIA: In the MICU, patient was tachycardic to >150 secondary to hypovolemia, pain and anxiety, improved to 140s with IVF and lorazepam PRN.
HR slowly trended down over the course of hospitalization with volume repletion and pain management, 90-100 on discharge.
# DELIRIUM: On HD#2 while in MICU, patient became acutely delirious with worsening sinus tachycardia.
# LE EDEMA: pt developed 2+ BLE pitting edema to thighs over first week of hospitalization, likely [**3-8**] large volume IVF received.
Gradually improved with autodiuresis, compression stockings and leg elevation and had completely resolved by discharge.
Considered DC'ing given increased risk of C diff but given pt's h/o significant GERD felt best to continue these.
Pseudomembranous pancolitis secondary to recurrent C. difficile CHRONIC ISSUES: 1.
Recurrent C. difficile colitis, s/p fecal transplant 2.
You were admitted to the hospital with diarrhea and abdominal pain.
You were found to have recurrent C. difficile infection causing pancolitis (inflammation of your entire large intestine).
You also had blood in your stool so Flexible Sigmoidoscopy was performed, with findings consistent with C diff pan-colitis.
STARTED oxycodone 5mg by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain 4.
