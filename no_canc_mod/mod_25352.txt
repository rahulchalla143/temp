Pt was eating dinner/drinking ETOH and began having nausea and vomting.
Hours later he vomited a 3rd time and "passed out" for "1 minute" injuring his head in the process.

# Gastrointestinal bleed: On admission to the outside hospital, an NG lavage was positive which cleared after 500 cc Normal Saline.
An emergent EGD was done which showed a Dieulafoy vs. gastric varix without active signs of bleeding.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], his hematocrit was monitored in the MICU and found to be stable at 30, requiring no further transfusions.
His INR was found to be elevated to 1.6, and he was given 3 days of Vitamin K with minimal improvement in INR but no further bleeding.
The liver team was consulted, and they initially planned an EGD on [**4-28**], but then deferred until after the weekend because of altered mental status.
On [**5-1**], he was noted to have a bloody stool which cleared by his next stool.
According to his outside records, he received a flexible sigmoidoscopy to the proximal transverse colon on [**2158-3-10**] at [**Hospital **] Hospital by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 67282**] which showed large red and injected appearing external hemorrhoids with noninflamed internal hemorrhoids, but otherwise normal.
No further workup was pursued, and he had no further rectal bleeding.
His EGD showed 3 cords of grade II varices at the lower third of the esophagus and middle third of the esophagus, to which 3 bands were successfully placed, as well as granularity, friability and petechiae in the whole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy with multiple petechiae.
Mental status - The patient was noted to have transient change in mental status in the MICU which was thought to be secondary to encephalopathy due to liver failure vs. alcohol withdrawl vs. medication sedation from his CIWA scale.
He was started on lactulose TID which was discontinued at discharge because he had developed diarrhea and his mental status had cleared.
Cirrhosis - The patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound on [**4-28**] which showed changes consistent with a cirrhotic liver, patent portal veins with normal hepatopetal directional flow, and RUQ ascites not amenable to drainage.
He was also started on lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy that was discontinued when his mental status cleared and also secondary to diarrhea.
Diarrhea - As a result of starting the lactulose, the patient developed diarrhea.
He had drops in his potassium and magnesium secondary to the diarrhea, so his lactulose was discontinued.
EtOH abuse - The patient is an active drinker despite being in AA and other support groups.
Thrombocytopenia - The patient was noted to be thrombocytopenic on this admission.
His initial platelet count of 31 was felt to be secondary to a consumptive component with his active bleeding and also likely secondary to cirrhosis.
Recent fall - This was felt likely to be secondary to hypovolemia from GI bleeding.
There was no evidence of ICH at OSH.
Please seek medical attention if you develop nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stools, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, change in your mental status, alcohol use or have any other concerning symptoms.
