PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Interstitial opacities predominantly within the lung bases appear similar compared to prior examination and correspond with known bronchiectasis.
Mild prominence of the upper lung vasculature suggests new superimposed vascular congestion; however, there is no overt edema or large effusions.
No confluent consolidation is identified.
No pneumothorax is evident.
Healed right-sided rib fractures are unchanged from prior.
Stable basilar interstitial markings consistent with known bronchiectasis.
No superimposed confluent consolidation.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion though no overt edema or large effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 year old female with a history of severe asthma requiring intubation in the past who was admitted to the intensive care unit with hyoxemic asthma exacerbation.
ACTIVE PROBLEMS BY ISSUE: # Asthma exacerbation:  In the ED, she had already been started on nebulizers, methylprednisolone, and magnesium.
Her asthma triggers are allergic, including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) although it doesn't look like she has been treated with omeluzamab as an outpatient.
There was no evidence on her CXR to suggest a focal pneumonia and she did not have a leukocytosis, thus antibiotics were not started.
CHRONIC PROBLEMS BY ISSUE: # Hypothyroid: Continued home levothyroxine.
# Hepatitis C viral infection (HCV): Last viral load 1,690,000 in [**2103-2-3**].
Miralax 17 gram Powder in Packet Sig: One (1) packet PO once a day as needed for constipation.
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having difficulty breathing.
We believe that this was because of an asthma exacerbation due to allergies.
