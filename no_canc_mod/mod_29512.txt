Admission Date:  [**2130-5-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2130-5-25**]   Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient presented for aortic valvuloplasty.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89 year old female with a history of aortic stenosis, who presented recently with complaints consistent with congestive heart failure, which included shortness of breath and increasing lower extremity edema.
Cardiac catheterization revealed an aortic valve peak gradient of 80 with estimated valve surface area of 0.5 cm2 and severely elevated filling pressures with prominent V waves.
Cardiac catheterization showed 30% ostial left circumflex lesion with mild left anterior descending artery and right coronary artery luminal irregularities.
A new left bundle branch block was noted on a post intervention electrocardiogram with a heart rate of 75.
The patient was then taken back to the catheterization laboratory for placement of a temporary ventricular pacing wire.
A repeat electrocardiogram after this procedure showed atrial fibrillation without left bundle branch block.
The atrial fibrillation is chronic.
There were no pacer spikes on this tracing.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Severe aortic stenosis.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
Family history of coronary artery disease.
Polymyalgia rheumatica.
Bleeding colonic polyps.
History of gastrointestinal bleed, polyps versus aspirin induced.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Neurologic examination:  No focal neurological deficits, alert and oriented times three.
Cardiovascular:  Irregular heart rate, IV/VI harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur, mild pitting pretibial edema.
Pulmonary:  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally with bibasilar crackles.
Several times she had brief bursts of a rapid atrial fibrillation, which spontaneously resolved on their own.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
The patient was to be discharged on [**2130-5-24**], but had a low grade temperature of 100.1 in the morning and stated that she did not feel well, more specifically that she was a little bit dizzy.
Blood cultures were obtained, a chest x-ray was obtained and the patient was held for a further 24 hours for observation.
On the morning of discharge, her symptoms of dizziness had resolved.
She had no further temperature spikes, with blood cultures showing no growth at the time of discharge and a chest x-ray showing mild congestive heart failure.
Since she was having bursts of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on her current Lopressor dose, she may need an increase in the dose of this medication.
Because of problems with bradycardia in the past, she may require a pacer in order for this to happen.
Critical aortic stenosis, status post valvuloplasty.
Atrial fibrillation.
