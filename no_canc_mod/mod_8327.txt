History of Present Illness: The patient is 78 year old man with history of CAD, dementia who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2139-11-20**] following treatment for pneumonia in the LLL.
During that admission he was evaluated by speech and swallow for risk of continued aspiration.
At that time it was felt that his mental status was the most limiting with regard to his ability to safely take oral nutrition and was recommended to remain completely NPO.
He was found by wife at the rehab facility earlier today with decreased responsiveness and worsening cough.
no difficulty passing urine.
no nausea or vomiting.

Microbiology: UA - negative Urine Cx - No growth Blood Cx - NGTD Sputum Cx - contaminated Influenza DFA - negative Stool C.diff toxin - negative .
Left basilar discoid atelectasis has cleared.
Osseous structures again demonstrate mild widening of the left acromioclavicular joint without change.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
ECG ([**2139-11-22**]) - Sinus tachycardia @ 114bpm.
Left anterior fascicular block.
No major change.
Patchy and linear bibasilar opacities are present, with configuration favoring atelectasis over an infectious pneumonia.
Non-contrast Head CT ([**2139-11-23**]) - No hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
Extent of periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity is stable and consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain normally aerated.
Atherosclerotic calcification is seen within the cavernous carotids.
IMPRESSION: 1.Compared to prior exam from [**10-24**], [**2138**], there is resolution of subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular blood.
AXR ([**2139-11-23**]) - There is a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.
Moderate amount of stool is seen within the colon and rectum.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
A slightly more coalescent opacification medially could possibly represent a developing pneumonia, though this still could well represent merely atelectatic change.
Lung volumes are low with atelectasis of the left lung base.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
If any, small left pleural effusion.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 78 year old man with a past medical history of multi-factorial dementia, h/o [**2139**] with diffuse SAH and intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus, CAD, hypertension, hypothyroidism, BPH, and a recent admission for pneumonia, who presented from rehab with worsening fever, cough, and tachycardia.
Fevers - The patient presented from rehab with worsening fevers while on levofloxacin for treatment of pneumonia.
The patient was noted to have unclear abdominal discomfort, but liver function tests and an abdominal X-ray were also unrevealing.
Given the patient's history of recent exposures to many health-care settings and failure of improvement while on levofloxacin, it was believed that his fevers were likely due to a nosocomially-acquired pneumonia.
The patient became afebrile and his leukocytosis normalized, with improvement in his mental status, while on the Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Tachycardia - The patient presented from rehab with a tachycardia in the 120s-140s.
Although he does have a history of SVT, his ECG showed sinus tachycardia.
h/o SAH - The patient was scheduled to have an outpatient non-contrast Head CT done with follow-up by neurosurgery.
The study was done as an inpatient during this admission, which showed resolution of the sub-arachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular blood, but persistent ventriculomegaly which was likely secondary to a combination of hydrocephalus and age.
The Neurosurgery team was notified that the Head CT was done, and their recommendations included a Neurology consult to rule-out NPH vs. post-SAH malresorption.
The Neurology consult team felt that NPH was unlikely but difficult to assess at this time, and recommended outpatient follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6817**] in [**1-10**] months for reassessment at that time.
The patient's prophylactic phenytoin was discontinued per Neurosurgery recommendations, given that the SAH and intraventricular blood were resolved on the repeat non-contrast head CT. .
Altered mental status - The patient has an unclear baseline mental status, but per the MICU team, the patient was not at baseline per his wife.
This was likely due to delirium from his infection superimposed on his multi-factorial dementia (Alzheimer's, vascular, [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body), as well as the confounding effect of the sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and hydrocephalus noted above.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia - The patient has a history of BPH s/p TURP.
Given his abdominal discomfort, a bladder scan was done which showed 400cc urine, but he was noted to be urinating spontaneously with good urine output into the condom catheter.
Hypothyroidism - The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and was found to have an elevated TSH to 30 and low free T4 of 0.5 on this admission, while in the MICU.
Given that these labs were drawn as an inpatient, and specifically while the patient was in intensive care, the free T4 level is unreliable, and therefore, the TSH may also be elevated beyond the actual current level.
The patient was continued on his dose of 50mcg daily, and should have outpatient follow-up of his thyroid function tests once he is over his acute illness and no longer an inpatient.
Coronary artery disease - The patient has a history of CAD s/p CABG.
He had no evidence of active ischemia on this admission, so he was continued on his aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker.
Nosocomially-acquired pneumonia 2.
Sinus tachycardia 3.
Altered mental status 4. h/o Sub-arachnoid hemorrhage Secondary Diagnosis: - Hypothyroidism - Coronary artery disease - Benign prostatic hyperplasia   Discharge Condition: afebrile, vital signs stable, symptomatically improved.
On the floor, these treatments were again continued, and you did well with improvement in your cough, fevers, and mental status.
You also underwent your follow-up Head CT for your bleeding after your fall, which showed resolution of the bleeding but persistently enlarged ventricles.
You should return to the hospital if you have any worsening fevers, cough, shortness of breath, or confusion.
