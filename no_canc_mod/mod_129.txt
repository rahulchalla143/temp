[**2195-11-24**]: TTE: Suboptimal image quality.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-9-25**], a left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now identified.
[**2195-11-25**]: Chest xray: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
On the lateral view, there is substantial bilateral pleural effusion.
No evidence of vascular congestion.
Cortical irregularity at the base of the first proximal phalanx and of the first metatarsal head is seen.
There is a lot of soft tissue swelling.
[**2195-11-30**] Foot XR - There appears to have been resection of the distal first metatarsal and base of the first proximal phalanx.
There is an overlying skin defect and associated subcutaneous emphysema.
Direct comparison to the [**2195-11-25**] films is limited due to overlying bandage, but the bone resection is new compared with [**2195-11-23**].
No other areas of focal osteolysis are identified at this time.
Sesamoid, left foot (A): -  Trabecular bone fragments with marrow fibrosis, acute osteomyelitis and osteonecrosis.
- Hyaline cartilage with focal acute inflammation.
Bone, left first metatarsal head (B-C): -  Trabecular bone with marrow fibrosis, acute osteomyelitis and osteonecrosis.
-  Hyaline cartilage with focal acute inflammation.
-  Hyaline cartilage with focal acute inflammation.
[**2195-11-30**] Left foot, proximal phalanx, excision (A): - Markedly reactive bone with acute inflammation.
[**2195-11-30**] Left foot, clearing fragment, excision (B): -   Bone with marked reactive changes.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo man with type 2 diabetes melitus, atrial fibrilation, and chronic left foot osteomyelitis with cellulitis was admitted with hypoglycemia and bradycardia.
Hypoglycemia: He was initially admitted to the ICU given persistent hypoglycemia in the setting of recent bactrim use with glipizide, which was thought to prolong the effects of the glipizide.
Bradycardia: Noted on admission, thought secondary to elevated digoxin level and interaction with bactrim.
Benign hypertension: The patient has chronic hypertension with poor blood pressure control.
The patient's home verapamil was continued, but his lisinopril was discontinued due to hyperkalemia.
Lasix was used as needed for volume overload and his lisinopril was restarted with improved blood pressure control.
Volume overload: The patient developed increased work of breathing and volume overload in the setting of his D10 drip.
Type II Diabetes melitus, uncontrolled with complications: His oral agents were held in house as above and glycemic control achieved with sliding scale of insulin.
He had no bleeding.
Chronic diastolic heart failure: He was treated with intermittent diuresis for volume overload.
Anemia: He was noted to have anemia of chronic disease, with stable hct.
Medications on Admission: Simvastatin 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY Warfarin 3 mg Tablet q TThSat Warfarin 2 mg Tablet qWMFSun Omeprazole 20 mg Capsule PO DAILY Trazodone 100 mg Tablet PO HS as needed for insomnia.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Secondary: Type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation.
Discharge Condition: Stable vital signs   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with low blood sugar and low heart rates thought due to a medication interaction with an antibiotic and your usual medications.
