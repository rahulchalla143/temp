Findings are consistent with right upper lobe collapse and possibly aspiration pneumonia.
No pneumothorax is seen.
A trace right pleural effusion may be present.
No evidence of acute intracranial process.
EKG: regular rhythm at 81bpm with difficult to detect p-waves, borderlin prolonged QTc of 438   Brief Hospital Course: 55yo man with long EtOH history here after an aspiration event with respiratory failure.
# Respiratory failure: Found with a GCS of 3, which improved with intubation and ventilation on the scene.
He had initial suctioning of food contents on arrival to the emergency room, then had a CXR which showed collapse of the R upper lobe.
He was at risk afterwards for a reactive pneumonitis versus aspiration pneumonia as a result of this aspiration, but he did not have fevers.
We recommended further observation for signs of aspiration pneumonitis and possible antibiotics, but he insisted on leaving against medical advice.
# Ingestion: His clinical picture appeared consistent with Listerine ingestion alone.
His serum osms were consistent with his hypernatremia and serum ethanol of 396.
We discussed his case with our toxicology team, who agreed that he was not at significant risk from other ingredients from Listerine, and he did not appear to have another concomitant ingestion.
# Alcoholism: At risk for withdrawal from both alcohol and chronic benzos.
He did not have signs of withdrawal and was able to discuss the risks of leaving against medical advice, including clinically significant withdrawal that could result in seizures or death.
# Chronic pain/anxiety: patient has chronic anxiety for which he takes multiple medications and self medicates with marijuana.
He did not show signs of delirium.
# Hypokalemia and hypernatremia: Improved with D5W and 40mEq of potassium.
