The patient has also been diagnosed with idiopathic cardiomyopathy.
The patient had been experiencing dyspnea on exertion for several years.
The patient had been managed medically until he began experiencing worsening shortness of breath.
The patient was referred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for cardiac catheterization which showed no coronary artery disease, critical aortic stenosis with an ejection fraction of 30-40%.
It was also noted at the time of cardiac catheterization that the patient had significant bilateral peripheral vascular disease.
It was also noted on echocardiogram that the patient had a moderately dilated ascending aorta.
The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for aortic valve replacement and repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm.
Aortic stenosis.
Peripheral vascular disease with an occluded left superficial femoral artery.
History of retinal hemorrhage in [**2140**].
Status post thyroid surgery.
Coumadin (the patient had been placed on Coumadin for his peripheral vascular disease).
During the procedure, there was concern for debris traveling into the patient's head from the endarterectomy.
The patient was taken immediately postoperatively to the Interventional Neuroradiology Suite where the patient underwent a cerebral angiogram which was negative for any evidence of intracerebral ischemia.
It was noted that the patient had a significant right carotid artery stenosis.
On the morning of postoperative day number one, the patient was woken up and extubated from mechanical ventilation without difficulty.
The patient was noted to be in complete heart block with a very slow ventricular response in the 20s-30s.
The Neurology attending felt that the patient was intact and did not have any neurologic complications.
It was decided on postoperative day number two that the patient should undergo a swallowing evaluation to fully rule out any neurologic problems.
The patient had no difficulties.
On postoperative day number three, it was noted by the Electrophysiology Service that the patient continued to be in complete heart block with underlying atrial flutter.
The patient continued to require pacing via his epicardial wires for his complete heart block with slow ventricular response.
Upon return from the procedure, the patient had multiple episodes of nausea and vomiting.
It was decided that the patient's nausea and vomiting were due to constipation.
The patient received laxatives and subsequently had a bowel movement and the nausea and vomiting subsided.
Heart:  Irregular with a sharp valve click, no murmur.
No wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.
The sternal incision was clean, dry, without erythema or drainage.
The left pacer pocket was without erythema or drainage.
The patient had trace pitting edema of his lower extremities.
He is to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for evaluation of his carotid stenosis on [**2144-12-1**] at 3:30 p.m.
