subdural hematoma  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old man s/p fall REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ?
subdural hematoma CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
No new foci of hyperdensity are identified.
There is no evidence of mass effect, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or infarction.
Hypodensity in the periventricular cerebral white matter is consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
IMPRESSION: Stable hyperdensity along the falx and tentorium, which could represent a small amount of subdural blood.
No new hemorrhage or mass effect identified.
MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST  Reason: Assess cord compression, disc disease  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old man s/p fall, ?
cord compression on CT. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Assess cord compression, disc disease The issue of potential false negativity of MRI in detecting ligamentous injury, as well as the other findings revealed by this study, were discussed by telephone with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11753**], trauma resident, at 11:55 AM on [**2141-2-14**].
Within these limitations, there does appear to be confirmation of a small posterior disc protrusion at the C3-4 level, which does cause some deformation of the ventral aspect of the spinal cord.
The CT scan shows with much greater clarity the moderate left and milder right-sided neural foraminal stenosis likely due to uncovertebral spurring and facet joint degeneration.
Also, the CT scan shows the prominent disc space narrowing far more dramatically than the MR study.
There is type 2 degenerative endplate change on either side of the C3-4 disc, although the CT scan again shows that this area also has sclerotic reaction, representing type 3 degenerative endplate change.
At the C4-5 level, there is a question of a 5-mm linear area of elevated T2 signal, slightly posterior to the midline axis of the spinal cord.
The finding could represent an artifact or a tiny syrinx cavity.
There is redemonstration of prominent disc space narrowing at the C5-6 and C6-7 levels with generally moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing due to uncovertebral spurring at each level.
There is a small right-sided posterior spondylytic ridge also seen at C5-6.
No other overt cervical spinal or paraspinal pathology is seen.
Confirmation of the presence of a C3-4 disc protrusion indenting the spinal cord to a moderate degree, with other degenerative findings as details above.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
ECG Ectopic atrial rhythm.
There are slight ST segment depressions in leads I, aVL and V5-V6.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
He was immediately taken to interventional radiology for pelvic angiography because of active bleeding noted on abdominal CT imaging; transcatheter embolization was performed.
Neurosurgery was consulted because of a small subdural hematoma noted along the tentorium; this injury was nonoperative.
He is to remain TDWB both lower extremities; may stand to pivot for bed to chair transfers only, but no ambulation.
Orthopedic Spine Surgery was consulted because of a C3-C4 disc protrusion with mild compression of the spinal cord.
