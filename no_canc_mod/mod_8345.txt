The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior,  inferolateral and inferoseptal akinesis.
The aortic  valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No  aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR ([**2116-12-29**]):  Mild CHF may be improved compared to [**2116-12-26**].
Nonocclusive thrombus is seen within the left internal jugular vein and left subclavian vein.
TEE ([**2117-1-7**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic.
The left ventricular systolic function is moderately to severely depressed.There is significant calcification in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no vegetations or abscess.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no vegetations or abscess.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a graft in the descending thoracic aorta.
No abscess is seen around the graft, however CT scan or MRI would be a more accurate test to rule out the diagnosis.
No TEE evidence of endocarditis.
CT abdomen ([**2117-1-8**]):   1) Small left inguinal fluid collection with surrounding fat stranding.
2) Extensive vascular calcification with the endograft in the thoracic aorta.
3) Simple bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
There were no procedural complications.
His aortic stent was observed to be in the proper position by serial CXRs during his admission, w/ no signs or symptoms of bleeding.
He does not require further anticoagulation for his vascular grafts after d/c, but must continue coumadin for treatment of DVT as below.
MRSA bacteremia: approximately 1 week after surgery, the pt became febrile.
The patient's left IJ central line was d/c on the 1st day of fever, and was noted to contain purulent fluid; the catheter tip was cultured and grew MRSA, making infected line the most likely source of bacteremia.
Surveillance cultures on [**12-14**], and [**1-5**] grew MRSA despite continuing vancomycin treatment, raising concern for possible bacterial seeding of cardiac valves or vascular graft.
He was evaluated w/ TEE, which showed no evidence of endocarditis, and w/ abdominal CT, which showed no evidence of vascular graft infection.
ID service was consulted, and believed that positive surveillance cultures were most likely [**1-20**] infected left IJ thrombus w/ intermittent bacterial showering.
At d/c, there are no signs of active infection.
The pt has been afebrile for nearly 2 weeks, and surveillance cultures from [**2117-1-5**] to [**2117-1-8**] show no growth.
He was loaded w/ IV amiodarone, and then transitioned to oral amiodarone, w/ no further episodes of NSVT observed during his admission.
Cardiology has recommended a PMIBI to evaluate for ischemic disease, to be performed as an outpt when the pt's acute issues are resolved.
At d/c, there is no evidence of cardiac arrhythmia.
He will need close f/u w/ his Cardiologist to monitor for arrhythmia and schedule PMIBI.
C. diff colitis:  he developed diarrhea after surgery, and stool studies were  positive for C diff toxin.
He was treated w/ a 14 day course of flagyl, and diarrhea resolved by the time of d/c.
At d/c, there is no diarrhea and no evidence of active infection.
He will need to closely for return of diarrhea or fever, which could represent return of C diff colitis in the setting of ongoing antibiotic therapy.
He was noted to have elevated troponin after surgery, most likely [**1-20**] demand ischemia from V tach.
He was treated w/ his outpt regimen of lopressor, ASA, simvastatin, and losartan during his admission, w/ no signs or symptoms of active ischemia.
He will require PMIBI when active issues resolved to evaluate for ischemic disease.
CHF: he has ischemic heart failure w/ severely depressed LVEF of 25% by ECHO.
Following surgery w/ aggressive fluid resuscitation, he had evidence of increased pulm congestion and LE edema on exam, together w/ O2 requirement of 4L/minute.
However, after a brief period of holding diuretic meds, renal function returned to baseline and lasix was reinstituted, achieving consistent diuresis w/ resolution of pulm crackles and improvement in LE edema by the time of d/c.
At d/c, the pt is maintaining good O2 sat on room air, and has no objective evidence of pulm edema.
He will need to continue diuretic therapy after d/c to treat persistent fluid overload and peripheral edema.
During his admission, treatment was continued w/ his usual outpt regimen, and he was covered for hyperglycemia w/ RISS.
At d/c, he will need to continue NPH and regular insulin for glucose control.
Creatinine was elevated above baseline after surgery, likely [**1-20**] prerenal azotemia and worsening CHF, as supported by his low FEUrea of 14%.
DVT:  after pulling left IJ central line, the pt was observed to have increased edema of the LUE, without pain or tenderness.
This thrombus had developed in the setting of heparin therapy after surgery, and was suspected to be the source of bacterial showering and positive surveillance cultures during this admission.
At d/c, the pt has persistent LUE edema, but no signs of inflammation in the LUE.
Pneumonia:  given the pt's persistent O2 requirement and exam indicating LLL consolidation despite treatment for CHF, CXR was obtained and demonstrated LLL infiltrate concerning for PNA.
The pt received 8 days of levaquin therapy before sputum cx was finalized, at which time it was thought that MRSA in sputum would be adequately covered by vanco and rifampin.
By d/c, the pt's PNA was clinically resolved, w/ no O2 requirement and no persistent evidence of pulmonary consolidation on exam.

Discharge Instructions: You are being discharged after treatment for aortic aneurysm, NSVT, MRSA infection, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure.
If you have increased diarrhea or fever after discharge, present to your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2742**] as you may have return of infectious diarrhea.
Present to the ED or your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2742**] if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, repeated back pain, dizziness, fever, palpitations, or other concerning symptoms.
