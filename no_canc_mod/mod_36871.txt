Over the past four month she reports progressive angina with pain and pressure radiating to her left arm, shoulder, neck, left jaw, and cheek.
Only with exertion and resolving with rest and/or sublingual nitroglycerin.
A stress test in [**2117-11-24**] showed posterolateral ischemia and an ejection fraction of 72 percent.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2118-1-31**] revealed an ejection fraction of 66 percent, LAD stenosis of 70 percent, left circumflex stenosis of 70 percent, and OM1 stenosis of 80 percent.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, elevated lipids, cerebrovascular accident in [**2109**], osteoarthritis, bursitis of the hips, renal calculi, and status post lithotripsy in [**2116**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient was lying flat in bed in no acute distress.
Positive carotid bruits bilaterally.
A positive [**1-30**] blowing systolic murmur.
Gastrointestinal examination revealed soft, round, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
No edema or varicosities with good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  Carotid ultrasounds from [**2117-11-9**] showed a left stenosis of 41 to 59 percent; no hemodynamically significant.
On the evening of her operative day, weaning of her endotracheal tube was unsuccessful with poor atrial blood gas improving when returned to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation.
On postoperative day two, she continued uneventfully with discontinuation of her cardiac pacing wires, increase of her beta blockade for a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure.
Coronary artery disease.
Elevated lipids.
