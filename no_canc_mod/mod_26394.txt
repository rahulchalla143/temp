The pt reports he was getting coffee this AM when he felt lightheaded, and dizzy but no overt chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, syncope.
He subsequently sat down and finished his coffee but appeared pale to his wife who checked his pulse and noted it to be irregular and bradycardic with a heart rate of 26.
The pt was BIBA to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] where an EKG demonstrated complete heart block with junctional escape in the 20s to 30s.
Otherwise his ECG was significant for LBBB with LAD.
He was afebrile with HR of 30 and BP of 160/82, with RR of 10 and SaO2 of 100%.
ROS: The pt denies any chest pain, palpitations, sob, abd pain, n/v/d, URI, sick contact, insect bites - specifically tick bites, arthritis symptoms, black stools, melana, back pain.
CAD: NSTEMI in '[**53**] when he presented with chest pain (positive top but neg CK) s/p cardiac catheterization with POBA of LCx.
Hypertension 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
Increased intraocular pressure  Social History: The pt is a retired realtor who lives in [**State **] with his wife.
NAD HEENT: EOMI, anicteric, op clear, mmm NECK: No JVD, no [**Doctor Last Name **] a waves.
No focal consolidations or pleural effusions identified.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis  is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a partially echo filled space anterior to the distal right ventricular free wall which most likely represents a fat pad.
No definite pericardial effusion identified.
Mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
EXERCISE MIBI  [**2163-7-20**]  Reason: CAD S/P PCI, ?
ISCHEMIA  RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA: 3.2 mCi Tl-201 Thallous Chloride; 22.0 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi; HISTORY: Chest pain.
History of heart block and pacer placement.
Peak heart rate: 77 Percent max predicted HR: 53% Peak blood pressure: 176/90 Symptoms during exercise: none Reason exercise terminated: stopped at patient request ECG findings: uninterpretable due to left bundle branch block  INTERPRETATION: Imaging Protocol: Gated SPECT Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tl-201.
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the myocardium.
No prior studies.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 75 yo male with history of HTN, CAD, inc chol, who presented earlier today with symptoms of dizziness and lightheadedness.
CV: A.  Bradycardia: The pt is currently in NSR, however was found to be in high degree AV block thought to be paroxysmal AV block secondary to diseased intrinsic conduction system.
The pt has a history of MI in the past with LCx disease which may partially explain the conduction disease (but not well).
Precise etiology of AV block remains unclear.
B.  CAD: The pt has a history of CAD with PTCA in the past but had normal stress test in '[**60**].
Given symptomatic bradycardia as above, we did not aggressively treat his blood pressure or heart rate given risk for further bradycardia or hypotension.
On [**2163-7-19**] he had an episode of chest pain which was sub-sternal, difficult to characterize, then moved to R side.
He did not have any anginal symptoms.
No further episodes of chest pain while in-patient.
Hyperglycemia on admission labs: The pt does not carry a history of DM, and this could reflect a stress response.
He should be monitored for fasting and post prandial hyperglycemia and should have an HgA1C checked.
Eye drops - Cosopts for right eye and ?Xelotan for both eyes   Discharge Medications: 1.
Secondary diagnoses hypertension CAD hypercholesterolemia   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for heart block and had a pacemaker placed.
You should return to the ED with increasing pain at the pacer site, fevers, chills, palpitations, fainting, chest pain, shortness of breath, or for any other problems that concern you.
You should also have your PCP check your blood sugar as it was intermittently elevated while you were in the hospital.
