Large hiatla hernia.
Probable bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax, areas of basilar atelectasis cannot be excluded.
There is no overt pulmonary edema, but crowding of the vessels and minimally increased vessel diameter could suggest increased pulmonary blood volume.
No evidence of interval recurrence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 year-old woman with severe kyphoscoliosis and chronic restrictive lung disease/hypoventilation, presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Acute decompensation was likely multifactorial: CPAP noncompliance, CHF exacerbation (elevated BNP, and overloaded on admission), COPD exacerbation, severe systolic pulmonary HTN.
ECG at baseline and w/o rising CE making ischemic event less likely.
She was treated with lasix for CHF, steroids and nebs for COPD, and antibiotics for concern for hospital aquired pneumonia with atypical coverage.
Patient was extubated successfully without any complications and maintained on nasal cannula and nasal BIPAP overnight.
# COPD Exacerbation: Treated w/short course of steroids, nebulizers, and antibiotics.
# Acute on Chronic diastolic CHF (LVEF>75% [**1-/2166**]): Initially volume overloaded.
# Acute on Stage 3 CKD: [**Month (only) 116**] be [**2-11**] poor forward flow from Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure (LVEF>75%).
She was noted to have macrocytosis w/ boarderline B12 levels.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease 9.
Hypertension 10.Osteoporosis 11.History of hip and back pain  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)  Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital with shortness of breath so severe that you required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
Your shortness of breath was likely caused by a combination of exacerbation of COPD and your heart failure.
Followup Instructions: It is very important for you to follow up with your primary care physician and pulmonologist given you had such severe respiratory problems this hospital admission.
