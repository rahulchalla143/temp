Patient was transferred on [**2175-8-7**] from [**Hospital3 **] ED with fever found at HD [**2175-8-7**] to 103.
He reports symptoms started the evening of [**8-6**] with sharp abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, and diarrhea.
He had an abdomen/pelvis CT that preliminarily showed gall bladder hypodensity without signs of acute cholecysitis.
He was transferred here for ERCP given elevated amylase, lipase and transaminases.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p stent [**1-6**] at [**Hospital1 2177**] in the setting of pna HTN gout: no active symptoms for several years, does not take ppx ESRD on HD x9 years, ?
[**12-31**] post-strep infection as a child?, on M/W/F schedule, last HD [**8-7**], at Forsinius in [**Location (un) 3320**] where he reportedly normally gets 5kg removed OSA on CPAP, pressure 17mmHg?, but is unable to tolerate at home   Social History: Lives with children (age 19, 22), denies past or current tobacco, drinks etoh only on special occaisions (less than once/month) but drank more heavily prior to HD, occaisional MJ but no IVDU or cocaine.
Physical Exam: VS: T 99.5 HR 101 BP 117/75 RR 28 Sat 93% on 4L NC Gen: NAD, obese man, speaking in full sentances, mild labored breathing, drowsy but arousable, witnessed apnic episodes while sleeping HEENT: PERRL, OP clear, MM dry, mild scleral icterus Neck: Supple, Right IJ in place, no LAD CV: Reg, Tachy, III/VI SEM best at RUSB, heard throughout, no r/g Resp: Decreased BS at both bases with scattered rales R base Abdomen: Obese, distended but soft, NT, no obvious masses but very protuberant, white striae, no fluid wave, tympanic to percussion throughout, unable to palpate liver or spleen; no periumbilical ecchymosis Ext: 1+ PE to thigh bilaterally; 2+ DP's B, left UE fistula +palpable thrill Neuro: A&Ox3, CN II-XII intact, strength 5/5 B UE/LE, sensation intact to light touch Skin: no rashes, lesions or ecchymoses .
No apparent extrahepatic or intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation or irregularity is seen.
No filling defects consistent with stones were noted.
[**2175-8-9**] Transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Infectious source was likely biliary tract vs. HD line infection, however also considered was pulmonary source w/ new O2 requirements although more likely from capillary leak/CHF.
The underlying infection was treated with IV vancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin for synergy until cultures at OSH grew enterobacter at which point only zosyn was continued with appropriate coverage.
Zosyn was switched to Ciprofloxacin after the patient developed a drug rash.
Initially he was hypotensive which was treated with IV fluids and discontinued propofol, switching to fentanyl/versed for sedation.
Shortly thereafter the patient became restless, agitated and continued to be hypotensive.
# Gallstone Pancreatitis: On admission the patient had elevated LFTs, pancreatic enzymes, bilirubin and alk phos.
The patient experienced intermittent epigastric discomfort which prompted a RUQ US, which showed a fatty liver but the common bile duct non-well visualised.
CT scan of abdomen showed no intrahepatic biliary dilatation, cholelithiasis, and a subtle hypodensity in pancreatic head.
Hepatology and ERCP were consulted prompting a second-look ERCP, which showed sludge drainage in the major papilla, stent migrated to major papilla and several stones in the cystic duct.
# ESRD: Initially the nephrology service felt HD was not appropriate early during admission, in setting of patient becoming hypertensive to 200s with volume resusitation for pancreatitis.
Beta-blockers were started however the patient did not respond and O2 sats started trending down with worsening acidemia and low PaO2.
# Hypoxia: Suspected capillary leak in the setting of sepsis vs. CHF as pt with known CAD.
# Drug Rash: Patient developed a diffuse petticheal/macular rash on his chest and legs which was pruritic.
Dermatology was consulted who felt consistent with a drug rash.
# CAD: An echo was performed to rule out endocarditis as a cause of fever.
This showed extensive calcification of cardiac skeleton, mild calcific aortic stenosis, and no definite vegetations .
His ECG had some ischemic changes of unclear duration, and the patient had no active symptoms.
Cardiac enzymes were stably elevated on admission and, in the setting of ESRD, this was unlikely to be acute event.
# OSA: Witnessed apneic episodes while asleep.
Known history of OSA on CPAP as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.
# Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Biliary Sepsis Gallstone Pancreatitis  Secondary Diagnoses: ESRD with hemodialysis CAD Drug rash OSA HTN Anemia   Discharge Condition: Good, tolerating regular diet, ambulating with walker for deconditioning, able to climb a flight of stairs, no oxygen requirement, VSS   Discharge Instructions: You were seen and treated at the hopital for a blockage in the area of your gallbladder, which caused you to become infected.
You may also use the skin cream for your rash as long as you need it.
Call your doctor or come to the Emergency Department right away if any of the following problems develop:  * If you are vomitting and cannot keep in fluids or your medications.
* You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomitting, diarrhea or other reasons.
Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
* Your pain is not improving within 8-12 hours or not gone within 24 hours.
Call or return immediately if your pain is getting worse or is changing location or moving to your chest or back.
* You have shaking chills, or a fever greater than 100.4 (F) degrees or 38(C) degrees.
* Any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you.
