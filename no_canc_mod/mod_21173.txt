HISTORY:  [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 14502**] is a former 31-weeks gestational age infant admitted to the NICU for prematurity and known prenatal hydronephrosis.
He was born to a 28-year-old mother gravida 2, now para 2 with past medical history notable for gastroesophageal reflux and cholecystectomy.
Pregnancy was complicated by moderate-to- severe right-sided hydronephrosis with possible duplicated collecting system.
Oligohydramnios was noted over the past week of pregnancy with an AFI of 5.5 for which an elective cesarean section was performed under spinal anesthesia.
There was no labor, no intrapartum maternal fever, or other signs of chorioamnionitis.
Rupture of membranes occurred at delivery yielding clear amniotic fluid.
No nasal flaring.
Chest:  No retractions.
Intermittent mild grunting respirations.
Right sided ballottable flank mass consistent with renal enlargement.
[**Known lastname **] had minimal evidence of apnea of prematurity with brief O2 saturation drifts and quick self- resolved bradycardia and apnea spells, the last of which was noted two weeks prior to discharge.
A soft systolic murmur was noted, that remained at the time of discharge.
The murmur was felt to be consistent with peripheral pulmonary stenosis, and will be followed as an outpatient.
He continues to grow along the 50th percentile with unfortified breast milk.
A rebound was obtained on day of life eight, which was 3.7/0.3.
Renal:  Due to the history of prenatal hydronephrosis, Urology and Renal were consulted from [**Hospital3 1810**].
A renal ultrasound was obtained on day of life one, which revealed a moderate hydronephrosis on the right kidney with numerous cysts present.
There was echogenicity noted bilaterally.
There were no apparent cysts on the left kidney, but this could not be ruled out on this study.
There was a normal bladder and no evidence of a duplex collecting system on either the right or the left kidneys.
A sacral ultrasound was obtained given findings of sacral dimple on exam, and this was normal.
Born between 32 and 35 weeks with two of three of the following:  daycare during the RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or school-age siblings, or 3.
With chronic lung disease.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out of home caregivers.
