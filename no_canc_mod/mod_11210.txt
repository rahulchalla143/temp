HOSPITAL COURSE:  The baby was initially intubated with a diagnosis of Surfactant deficiency.
Of note, earlier in his hospital course he was noted to have episodes of red secretions from the endotracheal tube that resolved.
These episodes were short lived, mild and was not considered to be evidence of a pulmonary hemorrhage.
His FIO2 requirements at the time remained at about 22 to 40% with some mild retractions noted.
This resulted in a satisfactory decrease in apnea and bradycardia episode.
He does have occasional drifts and periodic breathing that resolves with mild stimulation and suctioning.
At day of life 51 he was tried off caffeine and has remained stable with minimal spells since.
Subsequent echocardiogram showed no evidence of a persistent patent ductus arteriosus and good biventricular function.
It is also noted that initially the patient had a transient hypotension in the first few days of life with dopamine requirements.
Currently he is total fluids at 140 cc per kilo per day on PE-26 without ProMod.
He did receive a sepsis evaluation on day of life 13 secondary to temperature instability.
Neurology, the infant has had head ultrasounds, which showed no evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage.
