HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female who called her life line on the day of admission secondary to chest pain.
The patient reportedly had shortness of breath or chest pain on the day of admission and was found to be hypoxic on arrival to the Emergency Room with O2 saturations of 79% on room air increasing to 88% on 6 liters increasing to 94% on a nonrebreather.
At that time, she denied any cough or shortness of breath to the primary team.
Patient states that she has increasing fluid retention and decreasing p.o.
CHF with echocardiogram on [**11-27**] showing an EF of less than 25%, mild-to-moderate MR. 2.
CAD status post MI in [**2132**] with a 90% LAD with fixed defects on the [**2144**] stress test.
Carcinoid with chronic diarrhea.
Breast cancer status post left mastectomy.
Left hip fractures status post ORIF.
Total abdominal hysterectomy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Patient denies any smoking, alcohol, or drug use.
General: The patient was awake, alert, and oriented times three in no apparent distress with a blunt affect.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with crackles at the bases bilaterally and decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No clubbing or cyanosis, +2 dorsalis pedis pulses, ankle edema left greater than right.
EKG showed a right bundle branch block at 113, ST elevations in V3 through V6.
Cardiovascular/coronaries:  Patient has two-vessel CAD based on her catheterization in [**2143**].
The [**2143**] catheterization showed LAD with 80% stenosis prior to D2, 90% stenosis after D2, RCA with 40% stenosis in the mid section and 40% stenosis after the PDA takeoff.
Patient's CHF exacerbation on admission was likely secondary to her increasing hypertension.
Patient had one episode of flash pulmonary edema in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], where she again responded to IV Lasix and nitro paste.
Once her blood pressure was controlled, she no longer had episodes of flash pulmonary edema.
Pneumonia:  Patient had hypoxia likely secondary to pneumonia and worsening CHF.
However, secondary to transaminitis one day after starting ceftriaxone and azithromycin, patient's antibiotic regimen was switched to levofloxacin on [**3-7**].
Patient's coughing and productive sputum has now resolved.
Transaminitis:  Etiology of transaminitis was likely secondary to her antibiotics azithromycin and ceftriaxone.
Other etiologies such as liver congestion from CHF might still be possible.
Patient never had an elevated bilirubin throughout the admission.
Depression:  Psychiatry was consulted this admission secondary to questionable suicidal ideations.
Psychiatry stated that patient has multiple medical problems with depression and likely a component of dementia.
Patient had no signs of suicidal ideations on conversation with Psychiatry.
Psychiatry recommended continuing Celexa and also would continue to monitor for any serotonergic side-effects with Celexa in light of her pulmonary carcinoid.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 25%.
Breast cancer status post mastectomy.
Left hip fracture status post open reduction, internal fixation.
Carcinoid with chronic diarrhea.
