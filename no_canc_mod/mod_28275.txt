Pt was previously seen at [**Hospital1 64975**] for respiratory distress one day PTA and sent home on Keflex.
She represented to the OSH with worsening secretions and continued labored breathing.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4027**] - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 64976**]) or [**Hospital1 112**], however, there was no available beds so the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with concerns of worsening respiratory distress in setting of suspected PNA.
CXR revealed a possible subtle retrocardiac density.
The pt previously had a customized trach without a cuff which was found to have a leak in the ED.
Past Medical History: - severe mental retardation - CP - quadraplegia - Sz Dz (last 3 months ago) - chronic trach not vented; on 2.5 L trach mask - s/p PEG - scoliosis - chronic anemia - recent LLL PNA as above  Social History: Lives at home with mother, spanish speaking only.
By report no Tob/EtOH/DU.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOM full, no scleral icterus noted, drooling, frothy sputum Neck: scolotic, supple, no JVD appreciated, trach with granulation tissue, no crepitus Pulmonary: tachypneic, course BS thru/o with exp wheezes, decreased BS at bases, excessive upper airway sounds Cardiac: Tachy with RR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, mild ND, hypoactiveactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted, PEG site with SS drainage around site Extremities: contracted, trace pedal edema bilaterally, 1+ radial, DP and PT pulses b/l.
Skin: WWP, no rashes or lesions noted.
There is marked kyphoscoliosis of the thoracic spine, making these views non-standard in orientation.
Allowing for this rotation, there is no definite pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or consolidation.
INDICATION: Cerebral palsy, mental retardation, with pseudomonas infection, status post GJ tube placement.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained without oral or intravenous contrast.
CHEST CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is marked thoracic deformity due to severe scoliosis.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
There is patchy dependent atelectasis.
Several vague subcentimeter tiny nodular opacities are present at the right lung base.
There are no pleural effusions.
There is marked scoliotic deformity of the thoracolumbar spine.
There is a skin defect overlying the right mid abdomen, with mild soft tissue density in the underlying abdominal wall.
No fluid collections are present.
There is no free abdominal air or fluid.
No fluid collections are present.
No fever source identified.
Several tiny nodular opacities at the right lung base.
These are nonspecific and are likely chronic, possibly due to old infection.
Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 29 year old woman with CP and leaking J tube REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please change G tube to G-J tube and remove J tube.
There were no immediate complications.
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54747**] [**Name (STitle) **] DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2153-2-15**] 1:39 PM     Brief Hospital Course: Assessment - 28yo quadraplegic woman with cerebral palsy and severe mental retardation, chronic trach (not on home ventilation), who was admitted for respiratory distress and found to have a tracheal obstruction and possible PNA.
Respiratory distress - etiology most likely tracheal obstruction from granulation tissue complicated by pulmonary disease, possibly PNA vs bronchitis.
PE less likely in pt with chronic immobility.
In ED, trach was changed with new trach pushed past the site of obstruction by interventional pulmonary.
## Pneumonia/fever -  Initially thought secondary to PNA, then likely due to cellulitis around J tube site.
The tip was sent for culture and showed no grwoth.
She was started on vanc/ceftaz flagyl initially, sputum culture grew pseudomonas and received 5 days of this, however with worsening renal insufficiency and concern for AIN and pt with persistent infiltrates from previous records antibiotics were discontinued for pneumonia.
She had a bronch done in the ICU ~1 week after the admission which showed no new pathology.
WBC was up to 25 [**2-15**] with low grade temp of 100.9 on [**2-14**].UA/Urine cx neg, but sputum from [**2-12**] growing 4 +GNR on gram stain and pseudomonas on culture.
CXR from [**2-12**] did not reveal any new changes, however it was of poor quality and no lateral view can be easily obtained.
The pt was taken for CT of the torso to further eval for loculated effusions and abdominal abscess on [**2-15**].
Her vancomycin was discontinue as there were no gram positive cocci isolated on cultures.
She was continued on flagyll for empiric C diff coverage while her cdiff cultures were negative at time of discharge and her C diff toxinb B was still pending.
# Sepsis - On presentation unable to maintain UOP, goal > 30cc/hr.
On levophed briefly for presumed sepsis on presentation and titrated to MAP>70.
There was significant bile drainage from around site.
why she has G and a seperate J tube as well as her aspiration risk.
# Erythema around J tube - Patient was noted to have erythema around the J tube site.
Given fevers there was concern for cellulitis she was started on vancomycin (PCN allergy) [**2153-2-2**].
# ARF - rise in Cr from 0.5 to 1.5 after admission.
Urine lytes not consistent with prerenal.
# CP, mental retardation - continue ativan prn, valium [**Hospital1 **]  #.
