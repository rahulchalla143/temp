He initially presented to the OSH with fever to 102.9, and a sharp, intense, stabbing pain awoke him from sleep.
It was initially LUQ pain but radiated to the RUQ.
He took a double dose of his pain medication and the pain went away.
He tried to avoid pain medication later in the day, but the pain came back.
He also notes red extremities, but denies cough, SOB, CP, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, or diarrhea.
He presented to the OSH for this acute worsening of his abdominal pain.
He was found to have a transaminitis with an elevated lipase.
Zosyn was started for empiric coverage of his cellulitic process and for intraabdominal coverage.
His hospital course continued with his respiratory status helped some by diuresis.
The next morning he was pain free but his bilirubin continued to climb from 2.6 upon admission.
Now, his pain has returned in the RUQ though not particularly severe.
Bilirubin now 4.5, AlkPhos 185, with a mild transamnitis (60s-80s).
Given his persistent pain and transaminitis, RUQ u/s was performed which revealed GB wall inflammation and thickening up to 1cm without any stones visualized.
[**Doctor First Name **] there refused to take him for cholecystectomy, so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for potential intervention.
He denies any other symptoms of CP, SOB, palpitations, N, V, diarrhea, constipation, or leg pain.
He reports noncompliance with his BiPap machine noting that he "is an idiot".

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function.
Mildly echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
Small gallstone.
Limited evaluation of gallbladder does not demonstrate evidence of acute cholecystitis .
Cholecystitis, cannot determine whether this is acute versus chronic.
Contracted gallbladder with multiple gallstones.
No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Mildly echogenic liver, consistent with fatty infiltration.
Superimposed fibrosis and cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 yo morbidly obese male with history of DMII, CAD s/p CABG, chronic bilateral lymphedema, and obesity- hypoventilation syndrome presented with RUQ and LUQ abdominal pain, found to have rising LFTs, fever and evidence of cholecystitis on ultrasound.
# Abdominal Pain: Pt presented to OSH with LUQ and RUQ abdominal pain and elevated LFTs.
Transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU because surgery and ERCP services at the OSH were hesitant to intervene in this morbidly obese patient with multiple comorbidities.
His symptoms were thought to be caused by either gallstone pancreatitis, cholangitis, and/or cholecystitis.
ERCP performed here showed no gallstones, sludge or obstruction to explain elevated LFTs; CBD stent was placed (will require removal by repeat endoscopy as an outpatient after discharge).
Repeat ultrasound 24h after ERCP was nondiagnostic due to pneumobilia, likely secondary to ERCP.
HIDA scan did show biliary obstruction and surgery recommended percutaneous cholecystostomy, however patient's exam and LFTs improved after stent placement.
Repeat u/s showed a contracted gallblader and did not show evidence of cholecystitis, therefore no further intervention was performed.
# Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome/COPD: Original reason for ICU admission.
Initial ABG with elevated paCO2 and on initial presentation he was somnolent, poorly ventilating when oversedated which all improved with BiPAP, which he wore at night and during daytime naps and during periods of increased somnolence.
He required intubation for ERCP and was difficult to extubate, with high PaCO2 on ABGs.
Echo performed which showed an enlarged left atrium.
Patient felt his pain was well-controlled on reduced MS contin dose of 60-75 mg TID + 20 mg PRN oxycodone while in the ICU.
# Edema: patient has chronic venous stasis and is on lasix at home.
Echo could not demonstrate diastolic dysfunction due to poor image quality.
# Hyperlipidemia: Held simvastatin while elevated LFTs, restarted prior to discharge.

You were transferred from an outside hospital for an episode of severe abdominal pain.
It was thought that this was most likely due to a blockage and infection of your gallbladder and bile ducts.
You also underwent another radiologic study which showed that there was an obstruction of your gallbladder that could not be seen during the ERCP.
For this reason, you were evaluated for surgery and placement of a tube that could be used to drain your gallbladder, but after time your abdominal pain and liver enzymes improved.
You ate without abdominal pain and liver enzymes approached near normal prior to discharge.
During your time in the hospital, you also developed a heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation.
