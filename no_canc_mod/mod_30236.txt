Hypotension/Hypertension - Pt with very labile blood pressures ranging from SBP 90s-low 200s, likely [**12-19**] to autonomic dysfunction.
He was continued on his home Enalapril at discharge, but this should be discussed at his upcoming outpatient appointments with his cardiolgist and gerontologist, as the episodes of hypotension may be contributing to his instability and falls.
#Falls - Pt evaluated by PT who determined that from a mechanical state, the pt is a high risk for falling again.
# Bradycardia - Pt with sinus bradycardia, similar to recent [**Month/Day (2) 5348**].
# Head Lac - Was sutured in ED with absorbable sutures (no need to remove), CT of head/Cspine showed no acute process (no bleed).
CT Cspine does note thyroid nodules, which should be followed up with ultrasound if not previously worked up.
- needs thyroid ultrasound  # Multiple Sclerosis: Walks with a [**Month/Day (2) **] at [**Month/Day (2) 5348**]  # UTI: Likely colonized given chronic suprapubic catheter.
No fever, elevated WBC count, or elevated lactate.
- f/u UCx  #OSA: Bipap while inpatient  #Glaucoma: Continued home eye drops  #Multiple sclerosis: Has been stable for many years.
Evaluted by physical therapy - the patient is quite unstable and at high risk for further falls.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Mechanical fall Head laceration Acute renal failure Bradycardia Hypotension  Secondary Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation Multiple sclerosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were also noted to have mild renal failure, which also improved with intravenous fluids.
