History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 2405**] is an 80 year old female with history of paroxsymal atrial fibrillation(PAF) who presented with fatigue and shortness of breath for approximately one week.
She does not have palpitations or SOB and she does not know when she is in sinus or afib.
About a week ago, she noticed easy fatigue and dyspnea on exertion.
She works 4 days a week as a salesperson and normal walks up and down the stairs multiple times without difficulty.
Over the past week, she gets SOB with exertion and on Saturday, she felt dramatically weak while doing up the stairs and had to pause in the middle.
She denies chest pain.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35% %).
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area =0.7cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2109-8-29**] Carotid Ultrasound: Less than 40% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries.
Dense calcifications in the aortic valve, mitral annulus and coronary arteries.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Bilateral pleural effusions with associated adjacent relaxation atelectasis.
Bilateral non-obstructing kidney stones.
Hypodense lesions in the liver, too small to be characterized, likely cysts.
Mildly enlarged pulmonary arteries, consistent but no diagnostic of pulmonary hypertension.
THe LMCA had a discrete 30% lesion at the origin.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 20 mmHg and LVEDP of 35 mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with a PASP of 50 mmHg.
There was severe aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 50 mmHg and a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.45 cm2.
Left ventriculography revealed 1+ mitral regurgitation.
[**2109-9-3**] Myocardial Viability Stud: The LV cavity is not dilated.
There is a moderate to severe defect in the MIBI portion of the study in the mid to basilar inferior wall; it is unclear if this is a true perfusion defect or an attenuation artifact.
No correlative defect is seen on the FDG portion of the study.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe defect in the inferior wall on the MIBI portion of the study, but normal metabolism in this region on FDG.
The defect may be attenuation related, but this may also represent a region of hibernating myocardium.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2109-9-11**] 4:03 PM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: r/o ptx  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old woman s/p AVR/cabg and ct removal REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o ptx INDICATION: Rule out pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
There is no pneumothorax.
Hazy opacity in the left lower lobe indicates pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
Equivocal underlying consolidation.
New left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) 2671**] [**Doctor Last Name **]   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 2405**] was admitted to the medicine service with congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Cardioversion was initially performed on [**8-26**], and again on [**8-29**] for recurrent atrial fibrillation.
Given her aortic valve disease, she was cleared by the dental service after clinical and radiographic examinations found no evidence of infection.
On [**9-9**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed an aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting.
She was noted to have afib and was therefore started on Amiodarone, and over the next few days she was cardioverted temporarily to SR, following which the EP service was consulted.
Additionally she was noted to have left sided weakness and a slight facial droop, these findings resolved over the next several days.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Congestive Heart Failure(Systolic) Aortic Valve Stenosis, Aortic Valve Insufficiency Coronary Artery Disease Hypertension History of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation, Postop Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: 1)Please shower daily.
