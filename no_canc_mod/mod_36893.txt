History of Present Illness: This is a 71 year old male with history of renal transplant in [**2145**] on prednisone recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**], now being admitted for persistent low-grade fevers after dialysis accompanied by hemodynamic changes including hypotension and RVR.
He states that he previously had such a [**Year (4 digits) **] due to rapamune toxicity which he no longer takes.

CV: irreg, irreg with normal rate Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no RUQ tenderness Ext: cool extremities.
Ulcerative lesions scattered all over upper and lower extremiteis RUE edematous & LLE pretibial erthema, tenderness and warmth.
Left medial malleolus with deep, purulent wound and surrounding erythema.
Pertinent Results: [**12-28**] portable CXR: IMPRESSION: Improved interstitial edema with persistent opacity at left lung base.
[**12-28**] CT chest/abd/pelvis: CT OF THE CHEST: Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities within the posterior right upper lobe are new since [**2151-10-25**], and may represent infection or inflammation.
Patchy opacity at the left lung base persists, and there is more extensive peribronchiolar thickening and bronchiectasis at the left lung base, also concerning for recurrent infection or aspiration.Calcified focus at the left lung base may represent a granuloma.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions, not significantly changed from [**2151-10-2**].
Extensive coronary artery calcification as well as calcification of the aortic valve and annulus are noted.
The pulmonary artery remains prominent, measuring 4.1 cm, suggesting underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Mediastinal lymph nodes are numerous in number, although only a couple of precarinal and prevascular nodes are enlarged by size criteria, and are not significantly changed from multiple prior exams.
Extensive calcified plaque within the descending aorta.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: On this non-contrast CT, the liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder, and intra- abdominal small and large bowel loops are normal.
Left adrenal gland is normal.
The kidneys are shrunken consistent with chronic renal disease.
There is a nodular contour to the gastric fundus (2:55), and soft tissue density in this area that could represent intraluminal contents although mass cannot be excluded on the provided images (appearance less marked with only possible slight wall thickening in this location in [**2151-10-2**]).
There is no pelvic free fluid.
Pelvic lymph nodes are not significantly changed, the largest measuring 2.4 x 1.8 cm in the left external iliac nodal station (2:111).
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
There are extensive degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine with partial ankylosis at L5- S1 and high-grade compression deformity of the L1 vertebral body, unchanged.
Multiple old right rib fractures are again noted.
New/worsened bibasilar tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities and left lower lobe peribronchial thickening, concerning for foci of aspiration and/or infection.
Density at gastric fundus could represent luminal contents although soft tissue mass cannot be excluded; UGI examination or EGD could be obtained for further characterization.
No evidence of intra-abdominal or intrapelvic abscess.
Unchanged fluid collection abutting the right iliac vein, which again may represent a lymphocele.
Unchanged mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the torso.
[**12-30**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral akinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild to moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension  [**12-30**] RUQ US: IMPRESSION: Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
No fracture is identified.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen.
IMPRESSION: Soft tissue swelling overlying the lateral malleolus.
Soft tissue ulceration extending to 1 mm of cortex of lat malleolus suspicious for osteomyelitis.
Peroneal tenosynovitis  3. remote injury of tibio-talar ligament 4. subchondral signal changes in talar-navicular joint related to neuropathy.
Mild edema in calcaneous.
6. longitudinal tear of peroneus brevis tendon.
Brief Hospital Course:  # Fever/Hypotension: Pt presented with transient hypotension and AMS that was fluid bolus responsive.
TTE was also done and showed no vegetations.
Do not think endocarditis was the cause.
Patient then started to complain of worsening L ankle pain.
Had chronic wound on L lateral malleolus which was likely the source of infection.
Ortho was consulted and tap of ankle was performed on [**1-2**] showing finding consistent with gout and superinfection of the joint as gram stain was positive from gram positive cocci in chains and pairs.
It was decided that debridement of the joint would be difficult for the patient to tolerate given his multiple medical problems and thus he was continued on at least 6 weeks of vancomycin IV with [**Month/Day/Year **] work weekly to be followed by infectious disease for improvement in the osteomyelitis.
# MS changes: Altered mental status cleared after hypotension resolved.
Likely secondary to MRSA bacteremia.
# LFT Abnormalites: Elevated LDH, Alk Phos, GGT & Tbili elevated on admission..
Denies any RUQ pain and RUQ ultrasound pending.
# Afib: Pt with h/o Afib on coumadin, intermittently in RVR during admission.
# ESRD on HD: complicated renal history s/p failed transplant, apprec renal consult.
Of note, patient is on chronic steroid dose of prednisone 5 mg daily after failing a wean after having a failed kidney transplant.
Initially thought hypotension may have been adrenal insufficiency so received one dose of high dose steroids, but then with further workup thought likely infection as outlined above.
# DM: On insulin, decreased while he was NPO, now is back on home regimen.
# Hx of C.diff:  asymptomatic but continuing PO vanco taper per ID recs given he will continue to take abx on discharge.
# PPx: Systemically anticoagulated with coumadin - his inr has been below goal and he has thus been maintained on Hep SC with coumadin daily.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) nebulaizer Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Blueberry [**Doctor Last Name **] Healthcare - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: -Renal failure, chronic kidney disease -Bacteremia with MRSA from ankle wound and likely osteomyelitis -Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response -Aspiration Pneumonia -Septic arthritis -Gout   Discharge Condition: Patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable prior to discharge.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for low blood pressure and fevers.
We think this was because of an infection in your blood that came from your ankle wound.
We have treated you with antibiotics for this infection and you will continue to take these antibiotics when you leave here for at least 6 weeks.
You also had an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation while you were hospitalized.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have temperature greater than 101, shortness of breath, worsening difficulty with swallowing, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or any other symptoms that you are concerned about.
