Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed a single vessel coronary disease.
The LAD was a culprit vessel and had a proximal complete thrombotic occlusion before the take off of D1 with collaterals from the RCA.
The LCX had no angiographically apparent disease.
The RCA was a dominant vessel without any evidence of obstructive disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left sided filling pressure with an LVEDP of 21 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography revealed no evidence of mitral regurgitation.
The final angiography showed TIMI III flow with no evidence of dissection, embolizatio or perforation.
Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
Depressed cardiac index with central aortic normotension.
Mildly elevated left sided filling pressure.
Successful PCI of the LAD .
No pleural abnormality or evidence of central adenopathy.
Granulomatous calcification noted in the left hilus and right lower paratracheal mediastinum without appreciable lymph node enlargement.
Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2198-10-23**] no diagnostic interim change.
No intraluminal thrombus identified.
Fatty infiltration of the liver; otherwise no evidence of hepatic abnormality based on CT. .
Soft tissue stranding seen along the extraperitoneal space along the right iliac vessels, likely hemorrhage related to presumed right-sided catheterization.
Heterogeneous enhancement of the prostate and seminal vesicles of uncertain significance--this is not a typical appearance for tumor, and may represent infection/abscess--please correlate clinically.
Transesophageal ECHO [**2198-10-30**]: Conclusions: There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis  of the anterior wall, septum, and apex.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis.
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Cardiac: Patient presented to OSH with 8/10 SSCP, SOB and diaphoresis.
He was found to have ST depressions v2-v5 w/ hyperdynamic T waveforms in v2-v5 and possible ST elevations in aVR.
The patient remained chest pain free after cath.
ID: Post cath course was complicated by a fever spike to 104F.
Urine analysis was positive for a UTI with few bacteria and 21-50 WBC and the patient was started on Levaquin.
Urine was negative for chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient continued to spike fevers over the next two days and upon further questioning the patient reports having a recent skin infection.
He is a car mechanic and developed a pustular skin lesions with an erythematous base that began on his left hand after he cut himself on [**2198-10-12**].
With a presumed history of bacteremia with staph aureus, the patient underwent a TEE to rule out endocarditis that was negative.
CT scan showed no liver abscess or other signs of infection and his hepatitis panel was negative.
Liver transaminases were transiently elevated, but this is more likely due to his recent MI than an acute liver infection.
Abdomen/pelvis CT imaging showed heterogeneous enhancement of the prostate and seminal vesicles that was concerning for tumor vs. infection.
His prostate was smooth and firm on exam without tenderness.
PSA, however, was elevated to 23.1 which may be from his infection or from possible prostate cancer/BPH.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: ST-elevation myocardial infarction s/p stent to LAD on [**2198-10-23**] Urinary tract infection Prostatitis Staphyloccoccus skin infection   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, ambulating independently   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a myocardial infarction and had a stent placed in one of the main coronary arteries that supply blood to your heart.
However, you developed a urinary tract infection likely due to the foley catheter placed during your procedure and were started on the antibiotic levoquin for a 3 day course.
Despite antibiotic treatment, you still had persistent fevers which upon further questioning may have been due to the staphylococcus bacterial skin infection for which you were treated with antibiotics prior to admission.
Nafcillin antibiotic was started to treat for possible skin infection which may have seeded to the blood and prostate.
You will be discharged on a 3 week course of bactrim for treatment of UTI and prostatitis.
You should take plavix for at least 1 year to prevent thrombus formation around your coronary artery stent stent.
Please return to the ED or call your PCP if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, worsening of pain at your right groin catherization site.
You should have a prostate serum antigen (PSA) checked in 1 month for resolution of prostate infection and also to evaluate screening risk for cancer.
Your PCP should evaluate risk for prostate cancer given elevated PSA level and CT pelvis finding of enlarged prostate, concerning for tumor.
