He ran out of his medications 3 weeks ago and he began to feel progressively short of breath.
His shortness of breath progressed to the point where he was only able to sleep while sitting up as he would otherwise develop severe orthopnea and PND.
He then developed epigastric pain along with his shortness of breath and he went to [**Hospital3 417**] Medical Center for further evaluation.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) secondary to focal akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and severe hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen (due to chamber dilatation and papillary muscle dysfunction).
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Stress Test ([**2164-3-1**]): IMPRESSION: No symptoms or ischemic EKG changes with vasodilator  infusion.
Cardiac Perfusion Test ([**2164-3-1**]): IMPRESSION: No reversible myocardial perfusion defect.
Severe left ventricular enlargement.
Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity size with severe global hypokinesis and focal inferior wall thinning and akinesis.
Normal right ventricular cavity size with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The RVEF was mildly reduced at 44%.
Poor image quality precluded further assessment of the LCA.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonic regurgitation.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal and mildly increased, respectively.
There was also moderate atherosclerosis of the descending thoracic aorta  Theses findings are suggestive of a cardiomyopathy with at least some contribution of CAD.
Discharge Labs ([**2164-3-3**]): WBC-11.3* RBC-4.65 Hgb-14.7 Hct-42.8 MCV-92 MCH-31.6 MCHC-34.4 RDW-14.0 Plt Ct-320 PT-12.8 INR(PT)-1.1 Glucose-173* UreaN-46* Creat-4.6* Na-135 K-4.2 Cl-92* HCO3-28 AnGap-19 Calcium-10.0 Phos-5.7* Mg-2.9*  Brief Hospital Course: ID: Patient is a 74 yo male with hx of HTN, HLD, DMII, CHF admitted to OSH 4 days ago with shortness of breath, abdominal pain and cough and found to have NSTEMI, pneumonia and acute on chronic CHF exacerbation after stopping all medications 3 weeks now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further management of his CHF.
# CAD: Patient was admitted to OSH with epigastric pain.
His work-up revealed NSTEMI with peak troponin at 7.39 trending down to 2.31 at time of admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
He denied chest pain at admission.
He is not aware of a diagnosis of CAD and he stated he had never had a catheterization but he had taken nitro for chest pain in the past.
ECHO showed EF 15-20% with inf/posterior akinesis and severe hypokinesis of other regions.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] cardiologist [**Name (NI) 653**] and wanted to check persantine stress to eval if any reversible defect and no reversible defect was seen.
Labetalol was uptitrated to 150mg [**Hospital1 **] at time of discharge with labetalol used as beta-blocker since also has alpha-blocking characteristics and there was concern that pt would continue using cocaine in [**Hospital1 3782**] setting and have unnopposed alpha constriction on pure beta-blocking [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Since pt very likely to be pushed over into needing dialysis with either cardiac cath or cardiac surgery, decision was made to medically manage and pt discharged to follow-up with [**Doctor Last Name 3782**] cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**].
He has continued to use cocaine despite developing worsening SOB, palpitations and chest pain with active use.
# CHF: Patient was admitted to OSH with severe CHF exacerbation as evidenced by severe orthopnea, PND and pulm edema on CXR.
His volume status was much improved at arrival to [**Hospital1 **] although he is mildly overloaded and still unable to lie flat, oxygen dependent when baseline was no home oxygen.
His JVP was not significantly elevated, he had only trace pedal edema and bibasilar crackles.
CAD portion of disease was managed as above and ACE-I was held due to renal failure.
# [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Patient admitted to OSH with acute on chronic renal failure.
His [**Last Name (un) **] may be related to poor perfusion in setting of NSTEMI or may be related to ischemia [**2-1**] cocaine use.
Elevated creatine may be chronic progression of renal disease as did not improve over several days in the hopsital.
An ACE-I was held as above due to renal failure and decision was made to postpone either cardiac surgery or cardiac cath due to thought that this would push pt over the edge to requiring dialysis and thought that in setting of very poor social stability that this would lead to a worse prognosis than medical management of his disease.
#PNEUMONIA patient was also being treated for pneumonia as diagnosed at OSH.
CXR raised question of consolidation.
# HTN: Patient's blood pressures were moderately elevated on admission, but now well controlled with SBPs in 120s.
# HLD: patient has been on simvastatin 20 mg po daily in the past for hyperlipidemia but has been off of it for ~3 weeks.
# RHYTHM: sinus rhythm at presentation and pt stayed in sinus rhythm during admission while monitored on tele.
# DMII: patient has history of diabetes mellitus type, previously on pioglitazone at home, but has not taken in >3 weeks.

It is also very important that you see a kidney doctor (nephrologist) to prevent your kidney function from worsening so you can avoid needing dialysis for as long as possible.
The three most important thing that you need to do to prevent rehospitalization or getting much sicker are: 1.
