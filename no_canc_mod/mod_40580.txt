Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
There was a thrombotic total occlusion of the mid-RCA with no collateralization.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
There is a focal defect in the basal inferior septum on 2D and color Doppler with continuous left-to-right flow c/w a post infarction ventricular septal defect (VSD).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.

Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR ([**2139-8-30**]): Current study demonstrates top normal heart as well as bilateral hilar enlargement and pulmonary edema.
The findings might potentially represent a new acute mitral regurgitation with increasing pulmonary venous pressure and presence of newly developed pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
There is a ~1cm basal inferoseptal post infarction ventricular septal defect (VSD) with prominent left-to-right flow.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.

An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the mid to basal inferoseptal and inferior walls.
Transmural of late gadolinium enhancement in the inferoseptal wall, and 45% non-transmural late gadolinium enhancement in the inferior wall extending into the inferolateral wall, consistent with myocardial infarction and low (inferoseptal wall) to intermediate (inferior wall) likelihood of functional recovery after revascularization.
The late gadolinium enhancement demonstrates a microvascular obstruction-type pattern.
The infarct size was quantified at 18.2 g, which represents 21% of the total myocardial mass.
Increased T2 signal in these segments, consistent with edema/inflammation and acute/subacute timing of infarction (within 2 weeks).
Infarct-related muscular ventricular septal defect in the mid to basal inferoseptal wall measuring 7 mm in the long-axis direction, and 6-9 mm in the short-axis direction (9 mm at the mouth on the left ventricular size of the septum, and slightly tapering to 6 mm on the right ventricular side of the septum).
Ischemic mitral regurgitation with mild posterior leaflet tethering.
Global right ventricular hypokinesis with dyskinesis of the distal segments.
Late gadolinium enhancement in the inferior right ventricular wall, consistent with right ventricular myocardial infarction.
Systolic flattening of the interventricular septum, consistent with elevated right ventricular systolic pressure.
Left atrial enlargement.
A note is made of dependent patchy areas of consolidation are identified in the lung bases, right greater than left, with a focal area of nodularity in the right mid lung measuring 2 cm in craniocaudal dimension.
Findings are likely the sequelae of pulmonary edema, though aspiration or pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical circumstance.
A note is also made of punctate non-enhancing lesions in both kidneys, likely small simple cysts.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 y/o woman with STEMI and total RCA occlusion s/p DES complicated by post-infarct ventricular septal perforation.
[**Year (4 digits) **] showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
# VSD: Physical exam on admission to the CCU revealed a new III/VI systolic murmur heard thoughout the precordium concerning for new VSD/MR.
[**Name14 (STitle) **] showed VSD, cardiac MRI later showed 3:1 shunt fraction, normal RV size with free wall hypokinesis and elevated PA pressures.
Her O2 sat remained >93% on RA throughout her course and she was given diuresis for reducing pulmonary edema and shunt, and minimizing pulmonary hypertension.
The definite treatment will require surgical repair of the interventricular septum defect.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: - F/U WITH CT SURGERY/INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY - Adjust lasix 80 mg po qd - Should have RHC to assess shunt function which could help decide whether patient needs to have her shunt fixed  # A-fib: Pt was found to have a period of unsustained symptomatic A-fib, lasting ~30 mins.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: DM: Pt has documented hx of diabetes, controlled by Pioglitizone prior to admission.
# HTN - Her home Verapamil was held and she was started on Metoprolol and Lisinopril with SBP goal in the 90s given the lack of mortality benefit of CCB (especially verapamil)  # GERD - Patient has a documented history of GERD, and takes omeprazole at home.
# HLD: She was started on atorvastatin 80 mg po qdaily (PROVE trial) but it was decreased to 40 mg po qdaily given she was on multiple medications (amiodarone) which would uptitrate her statin dose putting her at risk for rhabdomyolysis.

You were transferred to our hospital for treatment of a heart attack.
We also treated you with several medications to reduce the risk of both another heart attack and of your heart becoming weak from having had a heart attack.
Your heart also suffered a complication from your heart attack in which one of the walls between the different [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] of your heart ruptured, allowing blood to flow in a direction it normally would not flow.
-Furosemide (Lasix), 80mg daily to prevent fluid overload -Metoprolol 25mg twice daily to lower your heart rate and help your heart recover from the heart attack.
Weigh yourself every day, Call Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**] if you notice your weight increase more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
