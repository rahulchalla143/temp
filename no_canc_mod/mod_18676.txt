Last admission to [**Hospital6 256**] was on [**2121-10-22**], with worsening ascites.
He denies any recent fevers or chills.
The patient does complain of a cough but no expectorant.
He denies abdominal tenderness.
Right inguinal hernia, at this point cannot be repaired secondary to liver disease.
Right thoracotomy and right upper lobe lobectomy secondary to cavitary lesions found to be Cryptococcus, negative LP for Cryptococcus.
Gastropathy in [**2121-4-16**].
Diverticulitis in [**2121-4-16**].
Hepatorenal syndrome.
There is a history of diabetes mellitus and thyroid in father, deceased secondary to lung cancer with brain metastasis.

Musculoskeletal: Extremities 2+ AT, dorsalis pedis bilaterally warm.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient went to the OR on [**2121-12-10**], with a preoperative diagnosis of end-stage liver disease secondary to cryptogenic cirrhosis.
The patient had a piggyback orthotopic liver transplant with a Roux-and-Y biliary reconstruction performed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**].
All bleeding points were ligated, and the abdomen was closed in a single layer with a running double looped #1 PDS.
The patient was intubated and received morphine for pain control.
On the following day, the patient did get an ultrasound of his liver demonstrating that there was abnormal arterial flow in the main, right and left hepatic arteries with a high-resistance wave form that suggests diffuse parenchymal edema such as preservation injury.
No thrombus was identified.
There was a 2.3 x 5 cm likely postoperative hematoma adjacent to the left lobe of the liver.
Infectious disease was consulted postoperative for a history of cryptococcal PNA.
On [**2121-12-12**], the patient had another ultrasound of the liver demonstrating 1) persistent abnormal high- resistance Doppler arterial wave forms, unchanged compared to [**2121-12-11**], that may be related to diffuse edema in the transplanted liver, 2) there is an unchanged small perihepatic, likely postsurgical hematoma.
Prior to the transplant, the patient did have blood cultures obtained on [**2121-12-10**], which demonstrated that there was no growth, and also a swab was obtained on [**2121-12-10**], which demonstrated that the patient had enterococcus sensitive to linezolid.
The patient had a hematoma in groin.
The ultrasound demonstrated a hematoma in the medial right groin on [**2121-12-12**], and showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
JPs were drainage serosanguineous fluid in large amounts.
On [**2121-12-14**], the patient had a right internal jugular catheter changed demonstrating that there was a persistent right-sided effusion but no pneumothorax.
The patient had a T-tube with a lateral drain and medial drain.
Cholangiogram was performed on [**2121-12-15**], as a regular postoperative exam demonstrating that there was biliary drainage, the catheter was at the tip of the jejunum, patent hepaticojejunostomy and anastomosis with reflux of contrast material from the jejunum into the hepatic duct.
There was no significant dilatation of visualized intrahepatic ducts, but dilated common duct was seen.
The patient continued to be afebrile with vital signs stable.
Podiatry met with the patient on [**2121-12-21**], for a left ingrown nail.
The patient's medial aspect of the nail was excised with partial wedge resection and covered with triple antibiotic ointment.
On [**2121-12-22**], the patient had an ultrasound of the liver secondary to increased ascites which showed that there was a patent extrahepatic main hepatic artery with improved wave forms, but the enterohepatic arteries could not be found.
There was no evidence of portal hepatic venous problems.
There was a small right pleural effusion without evidence of gross ascites.
Currently the patient has no JP drains.
The patient or the facility needs to call transplant surgery immediately at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] for any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, inability to take medications, any increased drainage from the incision site or around the T-tube, jaundice, redness, bleeding, pus at the incision or with any questions or concerns.
The patient is 1 and 1 of Tacrolimus with level today of 10.9.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage liver disease secondary to cryptogenic cirrhosis.
