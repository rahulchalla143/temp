Patient stated that symptoms occurred at rest and were accompanied by dyspnea, diaphoresis and nausea but no vomiting, syncope, palpitations or fatigue.
As per patient, his symptoms lasted 2 hours before he called paramedics.
His laboratory results showed elevated cardiac enzymes and LFTs.
Patient had mild hyponatremia and hypocholemia but remainder of chem 7 was also WNL.

Sister alive and in good health  Physical Exam: vitals T:97.3  bp:129/85  HR:114  RR:  SpO2:93% on 2L NC TELE: afib w/ PVCs and frequent NSVT Gen: WNWD, some apathy and anxiety noted HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, 2mm pupils, Anicteric sclera, no scleral injection Neck: soft, supple, no carotid bruits, no JVD, JVP @ 9cm CVS: regular irregular rhythm, S1&S2 heard, no rubs appreciated Lungs: CTABL, no wheezes, rales or rhonchi Abd: soft, NT, obese, no bruits heard, +BS*4 GU: foley catheter, patent & draining clean, clear urine, no hematuria Ext: warm, well-perfused, 2+ distal pulses (tp & dp), no iliac bruits heard, incision site C/D/I.
The mid LAD stents were 80% stenosed (late stent thrombosis) and there was evidence of progression of atherosclerosis in the unstented segments proximal and distal to the stents.
The LCX had mild disease and the OM1 had 70-80% stenosis.
The RCA had 70% tubular stenosis proximally.
3- Limited hemodynamic measurements demonstrated normal aortic proeesure and moderately elevated left-sided pressure with LVEDP 24 mmHg.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
Moderately elevated left sided pressure (LVEDP 24 mmHg) .
ccath [**12-24**]: COMMENTS: 1) Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures and a severely elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
2) Initial coronary angiography revealed a distal 40% left main stenosis, a widely patent LAD stent with TIMI 2 fast flow, the Diagonal had normal flow but an 80% ostial stenosis, the CX had mild disease but the OM1 had a 70% stenosis, and the RCA had a 70% proximal stenosis.
Mildly elevated right sided filling pressures.
Severely elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
Low cardiac output.
Restart heparin drip while IABP in place, routine ACS and CHF  care per CCU team.
Echo [**12-24**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior free  wall, akinesis of the anterior septum, dyskinesis of the inferior septum (with  aneurysm formation), and extensive apical akinesis (with focal dyskinesis).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal  with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+)  mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic  hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
Impression: extensive anteroseptal and apical infarction   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 51 year old male with history of atrial fibrillation, ETOH abuse & prior LAD stent placement who experienced an anterior STEMI [**3-14**] to restenosis of LAD.
1) CAD: The patient to an OSH with elevated cardiac enzymes and was subsequently transferred to the ccath lab at [**Hospital1 18**].
Cardiac cath showed mild disease in LMCA, moderate to severe disease in LCx, diffuse disease in RCA and LAD stent restenosis & thrombosis with diffuse disease with progression of disease proximal to the stent.
Overnight it was notd that his ST segments remained elevated in anterior leads.
The next morning on [**12-24**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1726**] c/o SOB after getting OOB.
He denied chest pain, N/V or diaphoresis.
However, EKG showed worsening of ST segment elevation.
An Echo showed EF 20-30% with akensis of the anterior septum, dyskinesis of inf septum, and extensive apical akinesis.
Therefore, due to his apical akinesis and his h/o afib, he was restarted on coumadin with a heparin bridge.
He was continued on ASA and plavix and should continue these indefinitely due to his history of restenosis of his prior bare metal stent.
3) Afib: this patient had a documented h/o afib and is currently followed by cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
4) ETOH abuse & Tobacco use: The patient was put on a CIWA scale with ativan prn for DT prevention.
2) Smoking and drinking are bad for your health and are particularly dangerous with your heart condition.
4) Do not engage in sexual activity until you are able to tolerate climbing two flights of stairs without experiencing any chest pain.
