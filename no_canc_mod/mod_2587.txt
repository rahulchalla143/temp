Most of right pleural effusion has been removed.
Minimal parenchymal changes are identified within the right lung base, presumably related to residual atelectasis.
No pneumothorax identified.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Moderate-sized right pleural effusion  FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral lower extremities including the common femoral veins, superficial femoral veins, and popliteal veins was performed.
Intraluminal thrombus was not identified.
A new moderately sized right pleural effusion.
New lingular atelectasis vs. early pneumonia.
US abdomen - IMPRESSION: No evidence of megacolon.
# C. Difficile colitis diarrhea: Positive stool c.diff.
A combination of IV flagyl and oral vanc was tried as well, with no improvement.
A flexible sigmoidoscopy was done by GI after 2 weeks of unremitting diarrhea - which revealed pseudomembranes.
sig was more suggestive of a C. diff colitis than an IBD.
After about a week of high dose vancomycin and  rifaximin - the patient started having decreasing stools at night and more semi-formed stools.
She was observed for a few days after the stools had decreased to ensure resolution and then discharged home.
Then after a repeat stool c diff x 3, and if the patient's symptoms are consistantly improving - a very slow taper may be tried.
# Hypoalbuminemia - likely from protein loss from diarrhea.
ECHO showed no significant findings and LFT's were normal.
Pleural effusion was noted on CXr which was tapped - was transudate and cytology was negative for Cancer cells.
The effusion could be due to hypoalbuminemia.
# Skin - The patient developed transient LE erythematous lesions when getting diureses - derm was consulted who recommend f/u in clinic.
Their differential diagnosis for these lesions include resolving vesicles secondary to edema and mild stasis dermatitis.
Their recommendations include - Topical moisturizer with aveeno [**Hospital1 **] and topical triamcinolone [**Hospital1 **] as needed for pruritus.
However, there was spontaneous resolution of the rash  # HTN: Metoprolol and Lisinopril continued.
# Hyperlipidemia: statin continued.
# Mild leucopenia was noted.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for Insomnia.
Potassium Chloride 10 mEq Capsule, Sustained Release Sig: Four (4) Capsule, Sustained Release PO DAILY (Daily): Continuue to take as long as you have diarrhea.
Recurrent C. Difficile Colitis 2.
Hypoalbuminemia/ pleural effusion 4.
Anemia of Chronic Disease 5.
Mild leucopenia  Secondary Diagnoses 1.
Hypertension 2.
Type I diabetes mellitus uncontrolled with complications 3.
Hyperlipidemia 4.
Mild COPD   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please return to the emergency room if you notice worsening diarrhea, abdominal pain or distension, fever, nausea, vomiting or any other unusual symptoms.
Also discuss with her about anemia and low white blood cell counts as we had discussed.
Your anemia is likely due to loosing blood in stool bacause of C. diff infection.
