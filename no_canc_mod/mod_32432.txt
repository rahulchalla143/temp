Admission Date:  [**2164-10-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-11-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2103-10-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**] Chief Complaint: transfer for management of pancreatitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line Arterial line  History of Present Illness: HPI: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, cholelithiasis s/p cholecystectomy, who presents from an OSH with likely acute pancreatitis.
Pt was initially admitted to the OSH [**Date range (1) 29693**] for two episodes of epigastric pain and abnormal LFTs (AST 466 ALT 268).
She was discharged with diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis.
That evening, pt called her GI doctor complaining of severe abdominal pain, n/v, tremulousness.
Her abdomen became distended, tense, very tender, with no bowel sounds.
CT of the abdomen revealed enlarged indistinct pancreas, extensive peripancreatic fluid consistent with severe pancreatitis and pancreatic necrosis, no loculated or drainable fluid collections or evidence of perforation.
Also noted were small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate amount of free fluid in the deep pelvis.
Past Medical History: EtOH abuse HTN h/o cholelithiasis s/p cholecystectomy OA of hips s/p bilateral THR Depression h/o heart murmur   Social History: Divorced, no children, lives alone.
Family History: Family Medical History:  Mother died of lung CA at age 76.
Father died of MI at 43.
Necrotozing, hemorrhagic pancreatitis involving majority of the body and tail and portions of the head and neck.
Small portion of enhancing pancreatic tissue remains in the distal tail and portions of the head.
There is no pancreatic ductal dilatation, however, a portion in the region of the genu is attenuated but not disrupted at this time.
Large bilateral pleural effusions and small-to-moderate ascites.
Note is made  CT Head [**10-16**] There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhages, edema, masses, mass effect, or large area of infarction.
The lateral ventricles are slightly prominent for age and represent mild volume loss.
There is no evidence of bony fracture.
EEG [**10-17**] Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the moderately severe suppression of the background throughout.
There was a brief episode of some "lightening," but the background remained encephalopathic throughout.
Medication effect is probably the most common cause of such recordings.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**10-18**] No intracranial abnormalities detected.
Specifically, no evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.
Incidentally noted adipose accumulation over the right malar eminence and right maxillary sinus air-fluid level.
Severe pancreatitis with extensive pancreatic necrosis sparing portions of the head and tail.
Bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increased.
Marked narrowing of the splenic vein and possible non- occlusive thrombus within its mid portion.
Peripancreatic phlegmon and free fluid in pelvis.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to increased stroke volume due to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
No valvular vegetations identified, but cannot definitively exclude given poor acoustic windows.
Technically suboptimal to exclude focal wall motion abnormality.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension  CT Chest [**10-23**] 1.
Multifocal patchy areas of consolidation may reflect an infectious process.
Moderate pulmonary edema including moderate pleural effusions, slightly smaller compared to the recent abdominal CT. 3.
2.3-cm spiculated right right lobe nodule is worrisome for malignancy.
for which short interval followup, after patient's acute symptoms resolved, is recommended.
No pulmonary embolism.
Interval worsening of multifocal areas of consolidation, probably reflecting an ongoing infectious process.
Moderate pulmonary edema with slightly increased moderate pleural effusions bilaterally.
8-mm right lower lobe opacity, smaller compared to the previously seen 2.3 cm spiculated right lower lobe nodule and probably represents atelectasis versus consolidation.
A chest CT following resolution of patient's acute symptoms is again advised.

OSH CT showed pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic necrosis.
She underwent MRCP at our hospital which demonstrated hemorrhagic, necrotic pancreatitis.
She subsequently developed acute lung injury, bilat pleural effusions, anasarca,and ascites as a result of the severe pancreatitis.
Her course was complicated by vent associated pneumonia as well.
She also showed altered mental status during her ICU stay related to toxic and metabolic encephalopathy.
There, she had PT/OT, blood transfusion for anemia from hemorrhagic pancreatitis, and diuresis.
This showed possible loculated left upper lobe effusion.
She underwent repeat CT of the chest on [**2164-11-2**] which showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions and anterior loculated left pleural effusion.
The patient was educated to return if she develops fevers, rigors, sweats, worsening difficulty breathing.
# Altered mental status: Her mental status was altered and related to toxic and metabolic encephalopathy.
# VAP: Sputum grew MSSA (imipenem sensitive).
CT chest on [**10-26**] was concerning for worsening multifocal pneumonia, so her antibiotics were changed from Imipenem to Vanco/Zosyn.
Cough improved with expectorant and mucous clearing device.
This showed possible loculated left upper lobe effusion.
She underwent repeat CT of the chest on [**2164-11-2**] which showed left anterior loculated effusion.
# Pulmonary edema/Acute lung injury:  Extubated [**10-21**] but emergently re-intubated [**10-23**] during event with SVT and hypotension.
CT chest showed interstitial changes and pleural effusions.
She was emergently re intubated on [**10-23**] during episode of SVT with hypotension that did not respond to electrical cardioversion.
# Horase voice: patient had traumatic intubation and continues to have a hoarse voice.
# RLL nodule ??????
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: severe necrotizing haemorrhagic pancreatitis acute respiratoy failure acute lung injury VAP   Discharge Condition: stable.
Discharge Instructions: You had severe necrotizing haemorrhagic pancreatitis resulted in respiratoy failure, intubation, acute lung injury, lung infection and anemia.
we found a small lung lesion that needs to be followed up with repeat CT of the chest once you recover.
