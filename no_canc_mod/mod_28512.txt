CXR notable for bilateral interstitial alveolar opacities.
Differential included pneumonia (aspiration, less likely community acquired), ARDS (?secondary to infection, fat embolus).
She was treated for presumed pneumonia and covered with levofloxacin/flagyl, treated with nebs.
She had no signs or symptoms for infection/sepsis from other source.
No history of blood transfusion.
She is now able to maintain her sats on RA though she does get mildly dyspneic with ambulation.
2) s/p liposuction, abdominoplasty and chin tuck Her incisions appeared clean and healing well.
3) Mild transaminitis: her LFTs were notable for mild AST/ALT elevation in the 100s.
Unlikely due to sepsis as her levels did not change with resolution of her acute respiratory distress and clinicaly recovery.
Unclear if she has had LFT abnormalities in the past.
She does have a hx of hemochromatosis but she believes her labs have been normal previously.
She had no physical exam findings to suggest chronic liver disease.
