History of Present Illness: 66 year old female with severe aortic stenosis who has been experiencing worsening exertional fatigue, dyspnea and activity intolerance.
She was previously able to walk 20 blocks twice daily but now is only able to walk once daily and she has some "twinges" in her chest while walking, along with shortness of breath and fatigue.
Given her known history of CAD and aortic stenosis and recent increase in symptoms, she was referred for outpatient cardiac catheterization and found to have clean coronaries.
