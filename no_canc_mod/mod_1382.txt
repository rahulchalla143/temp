Admission Date:  [**2150-4-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-4-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2078-6-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: CHIEF COMPLAINT: Pre syncope  REASON FOR CCU TRANSFER: pericardial effusion, hemodynamic monitoring   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**4-4**]- PERICARDIOCENTESIS, DRAIN PLACEMENT [**4-4**]- RIGHT HEART CATHETERIZATION [**4-6**]- DRAIN REMOVAL   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 11198**] is a 71-year-old man with a history of high degree av block, s/p PPM implantation and recent RV lead extraction with re-implantation, who presented with presyncope and was found to have a moderate/large pericardial effusion and is transferred to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring.
Per [**Hospital1 1516**] admission note, patient reports that since his last lead extraction and revision on [**2-26**] for a fractured RV lead, he has been having chest pain, described as a stinging sensation in his chest wall.
He was evaluated by outpatient EP and had pacer output reduced, with some improvement in his sypmtoms but still with a noticeable chest sensation that coincided with his pulse.
He remained active and observed post pacemaker precautions, however started performing situps on a daily basis.
About one week ago he felt a muscle sprain and started taking over the counter ibuprofen 600mg three times daily.
On the day of admission, he activated EMS after developing abdominal discomfort and severe nausea, followed by diaphoresis, weakness, and light-headedness.
He complained of nausea and was found to be hypotensive to 60's systolic.
Fluid boluses were given and bedside ultrasound performed which was concerning for large effusion and RV collapse.
Cardiology was consulted and a STAT echo was performed, which confirmed a large effusion but did not find evidence of tamponade with a pulsus of 8.
On arrival to the CCU, he is comfortable and free of chest pain or shortness of breath.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: Complete heart block -- s/p multiple lead and generator changes GI bleed   Social History: Retired investment banker, does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs, exercises at least 5 times per week.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
CV: Distant heart sounds, regular rate, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, no pulmonary edema, no pneumothorax.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate to large sized circumferential pericardial effusion with left atrial and right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
There is also significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Compared with the prior intraoperative TEE study (images reviewed) of [**2150-2-26**], the pericardial effusion is new and c/w tamponade physiology.
Pericardial tamponade with improvement in hemodynamics after removal of 400 cc of bloody pericardial fluid.
Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is minimal residual pericardial fluid.
There is still no tamponade seen.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2150-4-5**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
NO GROWTH IN PERICARDIAL FLUID      CYTOLOGY NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS   Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 11198**] is a 71-year-old gentleman with a history of high degree AV block, s/p PPM implantation and recent RV lead extraction with re-implantation, who presented with presyncope and was found to have a moderate/large pericardial effusion, transferred to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring.
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: There was no evidence of pericardial effusion on prior ECHO on [**2150-2-26**].
The new effusion was likely related to pacemaker lead extraction/revision with micoperforation of RV free wall, exacerbated by ibuprofen use, herbal supplements (some of which have antiplatelet and anticoagulant properties), and strenuous physical exercises at home.
Patient likely with active tamponade on ED presentation with the hypotension to the 60s and the RV collapsed that became compensated after IVF.
Differential for effusion also included infectious and inflammatory processes though much less likely given clinical history.
Pericardial fluid studies were negative for bacterial growth and AFB.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Suspect that if open procedure is pursued, extraction of old leads and revision of new leads could be performed simultaneously.
PRESYNCOPE: This was likely secondary to tamponade leading to hypotension and cerebral hypopefusion.
He had no further episodes of syncope or pre-syncope during his hospital course.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine 1.5 on admission from baseline of 1.0, likely in setting of hypoperfusion, volume depletion, and NSAID use.

You were admitted to the hospital because you were feeling dizzy, nauseous and lightheaded which was caused in part by fluid accumulation around your heart (pericardial effusion).
