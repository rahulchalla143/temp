Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 46 yo M with h/o morbid obesity, OSA, COPD, chronic trach, recent hospitalization in [**4-/2134**] with VAP with cultures + for acinetobacter and pseudomonas who presented to [**Location (un) 620**] on [**6-24**] with O2 sats of 78-82% and somnolence.
While in the MICU, his respiratory status improved and his blood cultures were notable for [**2-6**] Enterococcus so his abx were changed to ampicillin and he defervesced (he will need to complete a 14 day course of amp - to be completed on [**2134-7-9**]).
He did well until pm of [**6-29**] when he became tachypneic.
On [**6-30**], he again became tachypneic to RR 40s and O2 sats decreased to 79% on 40% trach mask.
He was changed to 100% trach mask with O2 sats 97-99% but continued tachpnea in 30s so he was transferred to the ICU team for PS o/n.
If his BP remains elevated at rehab, his clonidine dose can be increased.
Regarding the patients chronic back pain, he was given PO dilaudid PRN which was sufficient for pain control.
The patient was hypoglycemic at times during his MICU course.
If his sugars are elevated while at rehab, his lantus can be increased back to his home regimen.
