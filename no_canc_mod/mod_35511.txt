History of Present Illness: This is a 79 yo man w/h/o PEs, [**First Name3 (LF) 7792**], COPD on 2-3LNC outpt, who p/w 4-5days of SOB and nonproductive cough.
Since then, pt notes that his breathing was slightly better, but upon following up with his PCP this past [**Name9 (PRE) **], she noted that he was fluid overloaded.
Denied recent CP/palpitations, notes + orthopnea, PND, DOE.
ROS: The patient denies any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.
Past Medical History: # Dyslipidemia # Hypertension # Systolic heart failure- EF 35% # Aortic stenosis- moderate to severe # PE: junction right upper and right middle lob artery; also PE    of RML, RLL, LLL distal vessels # Extensive mural thrombus of aortic arch and descending   abdominal aorta # RLE DVT # Prostate CA s/p radiation # Hypercholesterolemia # COPD # Hx of ETOH abuse  Social History: Positive for alcohol and tobacco use: 6beers and 2 shots/day, 60pack year hx.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = XX %).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severe global LV hypokinesis with moderate LV dilatation.
Moderate to severe aortic stenosis.
Mild to moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation.
The inferior and inferolateral segments, which previously had relatively preserved function are now hypokinetic.
The degree of pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is slightly lower.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2727**] is a 79 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for COPD on 2-3L home O2, recent PE on coumadin s/p IVF filter placement, and recent [**Known lastname 7792**] medically managed admitted for [**4-14**] days of SOB, nonproductive cough, and hypotension.
The patient was found to have decompensated heart failure and started on dobutamine, dopamine, and lasix gtt.
Hypotension: This most likely represents decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock and less likely sepsis.
Pt ECHO shows reduced EF (20-25%) and severe global hypokinesis.
Potential infectious sources include urosepsis versus pneumonia.
The patient had worsening CXR showing possible retrocardiac opacity concerning for effusion versus pneumonia, although patient with recently treated CAP as outpatient with azithromycin.
A blood gas showed that he had hypercapneic respiratory failure and was placed on BiPAP.
Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial including fluid overload due to decompensated systolic heart failure (BNP >36,000), possibly secondary to ARF (Cr trending down from 2.1, baseline 1.0) and baseline COPD although without signs of exacerbation including wheezes.
ECG without evidence of acute ischemia and patient without chest pain.
ARF: FeUrea 21.3%, suggesting that acute renal failure is due to pre-renal azotemia consistent with decreased renal perfusion/forward flow from decompensated heart failure.
Anemia: Baseline hct of 30-40, now with hct of 27.9 after 1U pRBC with unknown etiology to acute decrease.
Pt haptoglobin (230) and TBili mildly elevated.
Pulmonary embolism: Patient with multiple PE in [**7-17**] currently on coumadin with mildly supratherapeutic INR.
