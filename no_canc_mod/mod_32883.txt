The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.

2.There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with antero septal and septal hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe MR is seen, some [**Male First Name (un) **] is noted.
CT TORSO  INDICATION: 88-year-old woman status post CABG, rule out infectious source.
CT TORSO WITHOUT IV CONTRAST TECHNIQUE: Multidetector scanning is performed from the thoracic inlet through the symphysis without intravenous contrast.
There is no axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.

There is no free fluid in the pelvis and no pelvic lymphadenopathy is noted.
[**Hospital **] bilateral pleural effusions and ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes bilaterally, left more than right.
These findings most likely represent pulmonary edema.
However, an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded for the parenchymal opacities and followup after treatment is recommended to ensure resolution.
There is no wall thickening to suggest ischemia.
Dilated gallbladder with multiple gallstones, however, no pericholecystic fat stranding to suggest cholecystitis.
Small amount of ascites in the abdomen and anasarca also likely reflecting fluid overload.
