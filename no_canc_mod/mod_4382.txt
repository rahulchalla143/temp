Admission Date:  [**2135-1-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-1-31**]   Service: [**Year/Month/Day **]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Right sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: MRI/MRA   History of Present Illness: 87 year-old right-handed man with a history of multiple strokes (deficits include residual language impairment and right-sided weakness of the face, arm and leg, see below), hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia who has been transferred from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation facility for evaluation of a worsening right facial droop and right-sided weakness.
The patient had been improving at [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation over the past month, after he had been hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] for worsening right-sided weakness in early [**Month (only) 956**] (see below).
However, at ~8:30 this morning, the patient was noted to have worsening of his baseline right facial droop and right hemiparesis.
His wife states that he was alert and without altered consciousness.
He was recently hospitalized from [**12-25**] to [**12-31**], when he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for right-sided weakness and "garbled speech", initially thought to be worsening of his known deficits.
He was found to be in acute renal failure and admitted to the medicine service with a stroke consult.
On the floor, he reportedly continued to have occasional dysarthria, but could give "clear concise yes/no answers when re-directed by (his) wife."
He reported worsened right-sided weakness compared to baseline, though it had improved since the morning prior to presentation.
MRI brain showed acute and subacute infarcts of the left occipital, temporal, parietal, frontal lobes and the left cerebellum.
MRA brain and neck showed no flow above the petrous ICA bilaterally with an occluded left vertebral.
Poor flow was seen in the right PCA, MCA, and ACA, while the left MCA and PCA were not visible.
A carotid ultrasound on [**12-27**] showed 80% occlusion of the right ICA and 100% occlusion of the left ICA.
However, subsequent carotid ultrasound done in Dr.[**Name (NI) 33385**] office on [**1-13**] showed a probable occlusion of the RIGHT ICA, possible occlusion of the LEFT ICA, and occlusion of the left vertebral artery.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Name5 (PTitle) 878**] and Schemmerhorn of Vascular Surgery were in agreement "that the best way to understand his anatomy and whether he may benefit from an intervention on one of his internal carotid arteries, is to conduct a conventional angiogram study."
The angiogram was scheduled for [**1-28**], and he was to be admitted the evening before for bicarbonate hydration and Mucomyst, given his renal failure  Past Medical History: 1.
History of stroke in [**2121**] in the setting of being postop from AAA repair, another CVA in [**2128**].
Residual defects include aphasia and R sided weakness.
[**11-28**] echo: EF >55%, no evidence of LVH   Social History: Denies hx of smoking, ETOH, or other drug use.
She reports he normally is able to be alone at home without problems, until recent worsening weakness.
Extraocular movements intact, no nystagmus.
Right facial droop.
Tongue protrudes midline, no fasciculations.
Otherwise, there is absent movement.
Gait:  Deferred given severity of weakness.
New regions of increased edema and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation in the anterior portion of the left MCA distribution and left PCA distribution, adjacent to prior left MCA infarct, consistent with infarction.
No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.
CT perfusion demonstrates elevated mean transit time and decreased blood flow and volume involving the entire left MCA and left PCA territory, consistent with completed infarction.
There is no significant ischemic penumbra identified.
CTA demonstrates occlusion of the left internal carotid artery with reconstitution of the petrous portion via retrograde flow.
The right internal carotid artery demonstrates severe, greater than 90%, stenosis just distal to the carotid bifurcation.
The left posterior cerebral artery, which is fetal in origin, also demonstrates an abrupt cut-off consistent with occlusion.
No clear source of embolism seen, but study quality precludes evaluation of left atrium.
MRI: Large acute infarction involving left MCA distribution and smaller acute infarction involving the left PCA distribution superimposed upon chronic left parietal infarct.
Likely thrombus within proximal left MCA.
He had an MRI which demonstrated new DWI changes in the left MCA territory representing a new infarct, likely embolic from his occluded ICA.
He has infarction of the entire L MCA and PCA territories, sparing the L ACA (due to vascular supply from the right side).
He was felt to have complete L ICA occlusion that unfortunately precluded intervention.
He remained globally aphasic with no purposeful movement of his right side.
He passed his swallow evaluation with speech therapy.
He had a low grade temp with evidence for a UTI.
He should be permitted to have slightly elevated systolic pressures.
Acetaminophen 650 mg Suppository Sig: [**11-26**] Suppositorys Rectal Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left MCA infacrt ICA stenosis   Discharge Condition: Right hemiparesis, aphasic   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because of increased weakness on your right side.
You should return to the ER with any new weakness or numbness.
