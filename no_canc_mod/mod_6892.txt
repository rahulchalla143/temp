Admission Date:  [**2136-10-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2136-10-13**]   Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Malaise and chest discomfort.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old male with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in 12/99, with peripheral vascular disease, chronic renal insufficiency and congestive heart failure, who is admitted with left sided chest discomfort today, status post taking Lopressor 50 mg for an episode of atrial fibrillation.
The patient was in his usual state of health until today when he visited with a visiting nurse who noticed an irregularly irregular pulse.
He was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate in the 160s.
He took the Lopressor of 50 mg at 5:00 p.m.  At 6:00 p.m., he developed chest tightness, neck tightness and left sided chest pain two out of ten.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft [**1-/2135**].
Peripheral vascular disease, status post right femoral popliteal bypass [**1-/2136**].
Temporal arteritis times four years on Prednisone.
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 1.9.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Procainamide with gastrointestinal symptoms, Amiodarone caused agitation and confusion.
Intravenous dye caused acute renal failure.
The patient is allergic to shellfish.
He has a history of recent increase in his alcohol consumption, three to five drinks per day.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies fever, chills, no cough, no shortness of breath, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no orthopnea, no lower extremity edema, no angina, and positive lower extremity cellulitis.
The patient says this chest pain is the first chest pain he has had in at least one year and denies any chest pain prior to his myocardial infarction.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was resting comfortably in a bed, complaining of mild headache.
The neck was supple without jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, decreased carotid upstroke and jugular venous pressure six centimeters.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing with minimal edema.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, small left pleural effusion.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute with right bundle branch block as well as left anterior fascicular block, Q wave V1 through V3 and ST depressions 1.0 millimeter with T wave inversions in V1 through V6 which are old.
OTHER PREVIOUS HISTORY:  The patient has a history of an ejection fraction of 35% with 3+ mitral regurgitation, status post coronary artery bypass graft [**1-/2135**] and aortic valve replacement [**1-/2135**].
ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 77 year old with coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, status post coronary artery bypass graft with aortic valve replacement, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 35% and 3+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ aortic insufficiency, pulmonary hypertension with multiple admissions for right greater than left sided heart failure, status post a recent admission [**8-12**], to the [**Hospital1 882**] for osteomyelitis complicated by a bacteremia on a six week course of antibiotics, recently discontinued two weeks ago, now admitted with hypotension, chest pain in the setting of a beta blocker, treatment for an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation [**2136-10-10**], and likely a hypovolemic state.
Cardiovascular - The patient has known coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, no angina, with prior myocardial infarction, aura at home over the last year, presents now with complaints of chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation and hypotension, may be related to atrial fibrillation symptoms or demand ischemia related to decreased blood pressure.
Troponin eventually increased to 3.7 possibly consistent with a non Q wave myocardial infarction secondary to a demand ischemia from hypotension.
His hypotension may be secondary to hypovolemia consistent with diarrhea as well as increasing diuretic dose as well as a beta blocker dose given yesterday.
The plan is to continue Aspirin and Heparin until rule out myocardial infarction, titrate off Dopamine as blood pressure improves with normal saline boluses, hold his ace and diuretic while hypotensive, continue Quinidine, hold Coumadin if remains in normal sinus rhythm, consider echocardiogram to evaluate for any worsening of function to explain worsening paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea symptoms and weight gain, continue Zocor.
Pulmonary - Pulmonary hypertension reportedly increased right greater than left sided heart failure symptoms.
Renal - Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine around 2.0 at baseline.
Recently worsening secondary to possibly Vancomycin treatment or Torsemide.
Acute renal insufficiency on admission here could be consistent with hypotension in the setting of a prerenal state.
Infectious disease - The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis of the right toes complicated by recent bacteremia.
No active infection evident at this time.
Hypotension may also represent possible sepsis if infection inadequately treated.
Gastrointestinal - Epigastric discomfort likely secondary to gut edema, abdominal distention from right heart failure, no nausea or vomiting.
Positive diarrhea in the setting of long antibiotic course.
Hematology - The patient has chronic anemia on Procrit.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was stable after admission except for mildly decreased systolic blood pressure with decrease to 70s but responded to a fluid bolus at 4:00 p.m.
The patient continued to be in normal sinus rhythm with episodes of atrial fibrillation, continued to be treated on Quinidine and anticoagulation was held.
After arrival to the floor on [**2136-10-12**], the patient was placed on telemetry and noted to have a run of 10 beats of asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia at 4:00 a.m. on [**2136-10-13**].
Also we discussed the possibility of placing the patient on Heparin drip if he was still in atrial fibrillation after 24 hours.
For his coronary artery disease, the patient was continually treated with Aspirin and Zocor.
The patient continued to deny chest pain although he remained in atrial fibrillation with increasing rate on movement around the room.
The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, however, he continued to have good oxygen saturation in room air.
The patient has a history of osteomyelitis in his right toes.
The patient had complained of some bloated feeling that he says he often gets with his congestive heart failure exacerbation and denies diarrhea.
