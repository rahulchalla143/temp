Left-sided Maze procedure with AtriCure Bipolar Synergy RF system with resection of left atrial appendage.
History of Present Illness: The patient was in her usual state of health until [**6-19**], when she experienced a rapid heart beating at ~8.15am.
She has had sporadic rapid heart rates and mitral regurgitation since [**2121**], but her typical episodes usually only last 10-15 minutes.
During the entire episode, Pt did not experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or light-headedness.
Per the Pt, she has had episodes of rapid heart rate ~ 1x yearly in the late [**2114**], increasing to a few times yearly in the [**2124**], and notably more in [**2137**] when her husband died, after which she would experience a rapid HR ~1x monthly.
Past Medical History: -Bleeding peptic ulcer [**2137**] s/p EGD and H pylori rx -Mitral Valve Prolapse with mitral regurgitation -paroxysmal atrial fibrillation w/ rapid ventricular response -Cataract surgery, OSH [**2140**] -Osteoarthritis  Social History: -Lives alone in [**University/College **].
Family History: -mother had rheumatic heart disease, no other cardiac family history -father died of lung cancer at 71 -several maternal relatives with stomach cancer - uncle died in 40s, 2 aunts died in 70s.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION: VS: T=96.2 BP=130/77 HR=98 RR=20 O2 sat=96 RA GENERAL: well-appearing woman sitting on bed in no acute distress.
LUNGS: clear to auscultation bilaterally CARDIAC: irregular rhythm, regular rate, [**3-25**] early prolonged systolic murmur, no rubs or gallops.
ABDOMEN: normal bowel sounds (cardiac murmur audible), abdomen is soft and non-tender, not distended, no masses.
No edema in lower extremities.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate/severe anterior and posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
There is partial P3 mitral leaflet flail.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a mitral annuloplasty ring in position.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
No mitral stenosis is seen.
There is mild hypokinesis of the inferior and inferoseptal walls at the mid-papillary level.
There is trace aortic regurgitation.
Moderate (2+) tricuspid regurgitation is unchanged from pre-bypass exam.
There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
There is right cardiophrenic density, which appears worse compared with the earlier film.
There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle which is probably new.
The lateral film suggests small bilateral effusions.
The upper zones are clear without evidence of CHF or focal consolidation.
Right cardiophrenic density and right lateral CPA effusion are new.

Echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation with bileaflet mitral valve prolapse and partial P3 flail.
She developed atrial fibrillation and was treated with amiodarone and lopressor and converted back to sinus rhythm, then junctional rhythm.
Due to junctional rhythm then heart block the amiodarone and lopressor were stopped and electrophysiology was consulted.
The ECG demonstrated high grade heart block and accelerated junctional rhythm at the time.
She eventually converted back to a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block with PR interval 0.32-0.38.
Warfarin was eventually resumed for history of atrial fibrillation and dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5.
6. warfarin 3 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: 3mg on [**7-5**] - then INR check [**7-6**] for further dosing - goal INR 2-2.5 for atrial fibrillation .
