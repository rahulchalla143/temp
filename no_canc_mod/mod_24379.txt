Echocardiography demonstrated severe mitral regurgitation.
A cardiac catheterization revealed 4+ regurgitation without coronary disease.
Past Medical History: depression prostatism  Social History: dental last exam [**10-15**] Works as a carpenter smokes a pack a day for 20 years episodic heavy ETOH use.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Normally-functioning mitral annuloplasty.
No significant pericardial effusion seen.
LV function is slightly less vigorous, although given recent correction of severe MR, the intrinsic LV systolic function is probably similar.
Intra-operatively he had brief atrial fibrillation and was begun on Amiodarone.
Amiodarone was stopped and his rate gradually increased to the 50s with a return of sinus mechanism alternating with junction.
The electrophysiology service was consulted for consideration of a permanent pacemaker, but as his atrial activity began to recover.
