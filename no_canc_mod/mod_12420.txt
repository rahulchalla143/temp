Language: fluent; repetition: intact for short sensences; cannot say month or day; not able to do DOWbw; dysarthria, no paraphasic errors.
CRANIAL NERVES: II: Visual fields are full to confrontation, initially she had extinction to the R; Pupil 4mm on the R, non-reactive; 1mm on the L (no info re prior surgery) III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact without nystagmus.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline, no fasciculations.
No adventitious movements, no tremor, no asterixis.

There are periventricular white matter changes (left greater than right), which likely represent chronic microvascular ischemia.
No suspicious osseous lytic or blastic lesions are seen.
No evidence of acute intracranial pathology including no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Chronic ischemic changes as described above.
MRI would be more sensitive for detection of acute stroke.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild diastolic LV dysfunction.
Carotid US neck: No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis in the carotid arteries bilaterally.
EEG: ABNORMALITY #1: There are frequent right posterior temporal delta frequency slowings with occasional phase reversing around T-4.
In addition, there are synchronous slowings in the right central region with phase reversing around C4.
ABNORMALITY #2: There are intermittent and independent left temporal slowings seen less frequent than abnormality #1.
BACKGROUND: The background appears to be slow but reaches briefly frequencies in the 8 to 8.5 Hz alpha frequency range and is mildly disorganized.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Sinus bradycardia with a rate of 54 bpm is recorded.
IMPRESSION: This is not a normal routine EEG obtained in wakefulness due to the presence of frequent posterior temporal delta frequency slowings, phase reversing around T4 and occasional synchronous slowings in the right central region.
In addition, they are independent and intermittent left temporal slowings with one brief run of sharp activity.
The first abnormality suggests subcortical dysfunction in the right temporal region.
The second abnormalities are suggested of cortical and subcortical dysfunction in the left temporal region.
Both findings indicate an increased risk to develop seizure activity.
A sinus bradycardia was noted.
MRI/MRA: Several foci of restricted diffusion involving the right frontal lobe, the right insular cortex and the periventricular white matter, abutting the right caudate nucleus consistent with multiple embolic subacute infarcts along the anterior division of the MCA and the lenticulostriate branches.
Note is made of moderately dilated lateral ventricles raising suggestion for possible normal pressure hydrocephalus.
Attenuation of the right distal MCA near the trifurcation including the anterior and frontal temporal branch consistent with thrombus formation and partial occlusion.
Correlation with the clinical symptoms and followup is suggested.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 year old right-handed woman with dementia and hypertension, who was brought to the ED for question of stroke.
NIHSS was 7, with dysarthria, partial weakness of left arm and left leg, initially neglect on the left.
CT showed possible R-MCA sign.
tPA was given within 2 hours after onset of symptoms per protocol.
Frequent neuro and blood pressure checks were performed and patient had tight glycemic control.
No prior EKG to compare however normal sinus rhythm, bradycardic, normal axis and intervals, no ST-T changes or TWI inversions.
Carotid US was negative for significant stenosis and 2D ECHO showed EF>55% and mild LV diastolic dysfunction.
MRI/MRA brain showed "several foci of restricted diffusion involving the right frontal lobe, the right insular cortex and the periventricular white matter, abutting the right caudate nucleus consistent with multiple embolic subacute infarcts along the anterior division of the MCA and the lenticulostriate branches" and "attenuation of the right distal MCA near the trifurcation including the anterior and frontal temporal branch consistent with thrombus formation and partial occlusion," consistent with her clinical symptoms.
EEG did show some focal slowing which suggests she is at higher risk for developing seizures.
However, she had no clinical evidence for seizures and she was thus not started on prophylactic anti-convulsants as they were not indicated.
Hospital course was otherwise notable for confusion and disorientation.
After several days, she no longer had these episodes and reported she was in the hospital because she "wanted to learn more about herself."
On discharge, her left-sided weakness was fully resolved.
Olanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One (1) Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] - [**Location 4288**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right anterior division middle cerebral artery infarction Hypertension Dementia   Discharge Condition: Improved, with resolution of left-sided weakness though still with baseline dementia.
Call the doctor or go to the emergency room if you have any difficulty speaking, weakness, numbness, tingling, change in vision, double vision, headaches, problems walking, or any other concerning symptoms.
