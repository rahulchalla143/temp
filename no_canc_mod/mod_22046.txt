As such, it was felt that the patient may be mildly dehydrated.
It was felt that it would be reasonable to restart lisinopril at 2.5 qd, and have her electrolytes checked in several days to insure that her renal function has not worsened.
For now, her lasix will be discontinued, as the patient was not felt to be overloaded, and it was felt that the patient may now be able to take in the POs necessary to compensate for diuresis.
The patient will have her electrolytes checked on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**12-16**], for assessing renal function, and these results should be forwarded to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
