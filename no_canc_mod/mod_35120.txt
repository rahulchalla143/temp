Admission Date:  [**2121-11-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-12-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-7-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint:  Called by to evaluate patient for headache.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2121-11-20**]: Angiogram with Embolization of A-comm and ACA aneurysm   History of Present Illness: HPI:  Pt is a 47 yo male w/ PMHx sig for hypercholesterolemia presents with acute onset headache subsequently found to have diffuse SAH.
The patient states that the night of [**11-18**] he had acute onset [**9-26**] headache.
As a result he went to an OSH ER where a CT head showed diffuse SAH in the basal cisterns and b/l cerebral hemispheres.
1 ppd x 18 years quit last year.
Physical Exam: ON ADMISSION General: lying in bed appears is discomfort HEENT: NCAT, moist mucous membranes Neck: supple Pulmonary: CTA b/l Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm, with no m/r/g Carotids: no [**Company **] flow murmur Abdomen: soft, nontender, non distended, normal bowel sounds Extremities: no c/c/e.
Fluent speech with no paraphasic or phonemic errors.
No pronator drift.
Final Report CTA HEAD, [**2121-11-20**]  HISTORY: Worst headache of life for two days and subarachnoid hemorrhage at outside hospital.
No prior brain imaging studies are available for comparison.
FINDINGS: The non-contrast CT demonstrates diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, with the greatest concentration in the suprasellar cistern.
However, subarachnoid hemorrhage extends into the interhemispheric and sylvian fissures bilaterally as well as inferiorly into the pontine cistern.
There are small amounts of hemorrhage in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally.
There is mild dilatation of the ventricular system suggesting early hydrocephalus.
There is no evidence of vasospasm, and no other vascular abnormalities are detected.
CONCLUSION: Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Contrast: OPTIRAY    [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    47 year old man with a comm aneurysm REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    s/p aneurysm embolization.
No occlusive vaso-spasm.
Final Report HISTORY: 47-year-old man, with subarachnoid bleed from the anterior communicating artery aneurysm, now status post aneurysmal embolization with seven coil packs.
Evaluate for placement and arterial patency.
Images were processed on a separate workstation with display of curved reformats, volume-rerendered images, and maximal intensity projection images.
FINDINGS: Again noted is bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, but appeared to have decreased in volume compared to the prior.
There is a metallic density in the anterior communicating artery aneurysmal site, consistent with the coil packs embolization.
There is no observable shift of midline structure.
There is no pneumocephalus.
There is no bony fracture identified.
HEAD AND NECK CTA: The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent without evidence of stenosis.
However, there is no evidence of vessel occlusion, specifically at the A2 segment.
There is no evidence of occlusive vasospasm.
No evidence of vessel occlusion or occlusive vasospasm.
Interval decrease in hydrocephalus and subarachnoid [**Year (4 digits) **] products.
Mild overall interval decrease of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No occlusive vasospasm.
Final Report HISTORY: 47-year-old man, with history of anterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture, status post coil embolization.
FINDINGS:  HEAD CT: There is evidence of decrease of subarachnoid hemorrhage bilaterally.
The prominent lateral ventricles now measure 71 mm in the right and 70 mm on the left, compared to 80 mm and 72 mm respectively.
This represents an interval decrease of hydrocephalus.
There is no evidence of fracture.
Allowing for this limitation, the carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent without evidence of stenosis.
Interval decreased hydrocephalus, especially in the right lateral ventricle.
Small overall decrease of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Patent vessels without evidence of occlusive vasospasm.
Mild overall interval decrease of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No occlusive vasospasm.

Angiography on 12.4 demonstrated ACOMM aneurysm at 7mm.
He underwent a CTA on 12.8 and 12.11 which were without vasospasm.
Around the middle of his hospital course it was noted that he had difficulty maintaining his O2 sats while sleeping.
He was transferred to step down where he remained stable with non focal neuro exam.
He will see us in the first week of [**Month (only) 404**] for another angio with possible completion of coiling.
