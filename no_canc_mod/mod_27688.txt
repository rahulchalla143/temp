Approx 4 months ago, pt began experiencing DOE associated with mild chest tightness; this began happening near the end of 2 mile daily walks that she had previously finished without difficulty.
When the DOE did not respond to asthma Rx and in fact progressed such that she had dyspnea and marked chest discomfort with routine daily activities, she saw a cardiologist.
She eventually had a stress echo, which provoked symptoms at moderate exercise, with ST elevations in inferior leads and a brief period of 2:1 conduction block, and echo showed inf HK.
Cath the same day showed no angiographic evidence of CAD in the LMCA/LAD/LCX, but the RCA was difficult to engage and seemed to arise anteriorly and course between the aorta and PA with non-selective angiography.
Family History: Her father had symptomatic CAD requiring stents at age 60.
There is no family history of congenital heart disease.
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
ETT performed on [**2111-12-15**], report from [**Hospital1 **]: Exercised 8min30secs of [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, stopped for chest pain and dyspnea.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2111-12-15**], report from [**Hospital1 **]: Right dominant system, no flow limiting disease in the LMCA, LAD, or LCX.
[**Hospital1 **] take off of the RCA visualized with non-selective angiography; take-off appears to be between the aorta and pulmonary artery anteriorly.

2) Function: Breath-hold cine SSFP images were acquired in the left ventricular 2-chamber, 4-chamber, horizontal long axis, short axis slices (8 mm slices with 2 mm gaps), sagittal and coronal orientations of the left ventricular outflow tract, and aortic valve short axis orientations.
4) Coronary MRI ([**Last Name (NamePattern1) 75514**] screen): Free-breathing ECG-gated navigator gated/corrected T2 prep 3D SSFP coronary MRI of the aortic root and coronary ostia were obtained in the axial plane.
There were no pericardial or pleural effusions.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased.
Quantitative Flow There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt.
Aortic flow demonstrated no significant aortic regurgitation.
The calculated mitral valve regurgitant fraction was consistent with mild mitral regurgitation.
The right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow demonstrated no significant pulmonic or tricuspid regurgitation.
The LAD and LCx had normal caliber and signal characteristics.
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] right coronary artery with origin from the left coronary cusp, luminal narrowing proximally, and anterior course between the ascending aorta and main pulmonary artery (malignant).
Mild mitral regurgitation.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased.
She was given 48 hours of perioperative vancomycin as prophylaxis as she was in the hospital preoperatively.
Discharge Instructions: Call with fever, redness or drainage from incision or weight gain more than 2 pounds in one day or five in one week.
