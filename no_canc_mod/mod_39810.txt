Admission Date:  [**2119-8-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-8-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-1-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**] Chief Complaint: Tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal stricture  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2119-8-10**] Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage  [**2119-8-8**] Left 14-French pigtail catheter placement  [**2119-8-3**] Repair of tracheoesophageal fistula; tracheal resection and reconstruction; flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with central compartment neck dissection, left hemithyroidectomy and left recurrent nerve sacrifice.
Pectoralis major myofascial flap right side.
He has a history of esophageal carcinoma status-post radiation with 3-hole esohagectomy in [**2104**] at [**Hospital1 112**].
He was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for PNA and found to have stricture near the cricopharyngeus, with evidence of tracheoesophageal fistulation.
An EGD showed no cancer recurrence however.
A J-tube was placed in [**2119-4-19**], but since that time has had issues with dehydration and instances of clogged J-tube, thus he has been on supplemental TPN.
Recently, he reported no fever, no chills, and decreased PO intake.
He still is on tube feeds, reports no abdominal pain.
The daughter, [**Name (NI) 2184**], reports occasionnal diarrhea, which she thinks is due to his lactose intolerance.
He complains of mild dyspnea and reports an occasional productive cough characterized by white sputum.
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] the night before surgery on [**2119-8-2**] and on [**2119-8-3**] underwent repair of tracheoesophageal fistula; tracheal resection and reconstruction; flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with central compartment neck dissection, left hemithyroidectomy and left recurrent nerve sacrifice; with repair of tracheoesophageal fistula with interposition flap and pectoralis major myofascial flap on the right side, with a split-thickness skin graft 1 inch x 10 cm to right neck.
On [**2119-8-6**], he required placement of a 14-French left pigtail catheter for pleural effusion.
Past Medical History: -Hypertension -Hypothyroidism -Prostate cancer s/p XRT -h/o esophageal CA s/p XRT with 3-hole esohagectomy in [**2104**] at [**Hospital1 112**].
Recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for PNA and found to have stricture near cricopharyngeus, with evidence of TEF.
EGD showed no cancer recurrence.
J-tube placed [**4-/2119**] -Small bowel obstruction -Cognitive deficit NOS vs limited safety awareness -Orthostatic hypotension - hospitalization [**1-/2119**] after fall -DVT of the L subclavian and L axillary vein -R hip fracture s/p ORIF by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] @ [**Hospital1 112**] -RLL PNA [**1-11**], treated with levofloxacin -multiple stab wounds to the abdomen in the [**2079**] -right sided PTX after bronchoscopy s/p CT placement -Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy -R wrist and hand surgery   Social History: Originally from [**State 9512**].
One daughter lives in [**State 4260**], another is in [**Name (NI) 86**], and [**Doctor First Name 2184**] who is very involved.
Family History: Mother died of a blood clot.
Sister died of obesity and "fat around her heart"  Physical Exam: Afebrile vitals WNL AAOX3 NAD RRR CTAB trach intact soft NT/ND wounds c/d/i no edema, extrem warm  Pertinent Results: G/GJ/GI TUBE CHECK ([**2119-8-5**]): 1.
No evidence of J-tube leak.
Right lung base fibrosis and loculated effusions.
Diffuse skeletal demineralization and degenerative changes  TRACHEAL TISSUE/TEF PATHOLOGY ([**2119-8-4**]): Membranous wall portion of tracheo-esophageal fistula: Squamous mucosa with erosion and fibrosis.
No evidence of malignancy noted.
Right middle and bilateral lower lobe collapse, absent bronchial obstruction, accompanied by small-to-moderate pleural effusions is probably relaxation atelectasis.
Small pericardial effusion is new, postoperatively, but probably not clinically significant.
Small upper mediastinal retrotracheal hematoma, and larger soft tissue hematoma in the right neck and upper chest with a large intramuscular component in the right pectoralis flap.
Small gas collections in the upper mediastinum may be residual rather than an indication of active leak.
CT NECK W/WITHOUT CONTRAST   Brief Hospital Course: NEURO/PAIN: Mr. [**Known lastname 93780**] pain post-operatively has remained controlled with Fentanyl.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Post-op, Mr. [**Known lastname 93756**] remained hemodynamically stable with systolic pressures in 120-140s and without an abnormal cardiac rhythm.
The patient appeared slightly volume overloaded on POD#6, around 3L positive.
He autodiuresed well and was euvolemic by the end of his hospitalization  RESPIRATORY: Patient remained intubated post-op on [**2119-8-3**] with a high tracheal anastamosis and history of difficult intubation.
The patient was weaned on [**2119-8-4**] and required re-intubation when his oxygen saturations dropped and he became tachypneic.
On POD#2 a left pigtail catheter was placed by IP to drain a moderate left pleural effusion.
He initially was extubated on POD# 2 and developed hypercarbia requiring re-intubation that same evening.
Right sided pleural effusion was noted on POD#7, but this was follow-ed without intervention.
Patient required reintubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure on POD#8 and although his mechanics of ventilation were adequate, bronchoscopy on POD#13 demonstrated questionable compromise of the tracheal anastamosis, and patient underwent tracheostomy on [**2119-8-18**].
A PPI was utilized for GI prophylaxis.
HEME/ID: Post-op hematocrit was stable at 32.8 and no evidence of bleeding was noted.
Bronchoscopy and BAL on [**2119-8-3**] showed PMNs 3+ and 4+ gram positive cocci with gram positive rods that were established as commensal organisms.
The patient was placed on Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole on [**2119-8-3**] (for a 10 day course) post-op given the respiratory contaimination with TEF, the extent of surgical intervention, and the need for re-exploration at the end of surgery for JP drain perforation of the neo-esophagus--which was subsequently repaired without issue.
Antibiotics were switched to Vancomycin and Cefepime on [**2119-8-12**] when a bronch/BAL grew gram positive cocci and gram positive rods.
On [**2119-8-14**], a repeat bronchoscopy/BAL revealed coagulase positive Staphylococcus that was noted to be MRSA for which antibiotics were continued.
PROPHYLAXIS: Heparin 5000 units SQ TID was given for DVT prophylaxis.
No meds in J-tube.
