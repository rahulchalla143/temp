He was later transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued trauma care.
improved atelectasis/consolidations  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 17M s/p c-spine cord injury with, on trach collar, desaturation and fever , bronch'd [**6-14**] for LLL consolidation REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ?
HISTORY: Spinal cord injury, fever and desaturation.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2077-6-9**], and 19:  Diffuse interstitial pulmonary abnormality has resolved, but left lower lobe consolidation has not and could be due to persistent atelectasis or pneumonia.
There is no appreciable pleural abnormality.
Field of view: 33 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 17 year old man with c-spine fx, s/p c spine surgery, now with unexplained fevers while on Abx.Small leakage from PEG site.
INDICATIONS: 17-year-old man with cervical spine fracture status post cervical spine surgery, now with unexplained fever.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a tracheostomy tube.
There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axial lymphadenopathy.
There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
There is a small density at the right lung base peripherally, probably atelectasis.
In addition, there is a vaguely increased ground glass opacity throughout the right lower lobe, sparing the right middle and upper lobes.
This appearance could represent the very early appearance of the consolidation or perhaps atypical pneumonia.
Although the presence of infection cannot be excluded, the left lower lobe opacity, with volume loss, is most consistent with atelectasis.
A hypoattenuating focus in the right kidney of 11 x 16 mm in axial dimensions is not fully characterized but most likely represents a simple cyst.
There is an infrarenal inferior vena cava filter in appropriate position.
There is no lymphadenopathy or free air or fluid.
There is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Near collapse of the left lower lobe.
Diffuse nodular ground-glass opacity throughout the right lower lobe, suggestive of atypical infection and/or very early consolidation.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2166-6-10**] 4:29 PM  BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  Reason: FEVER AND BEDREST SPINAL CORD INJURY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 17 year old man with C-spine injury, REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: looking for DVT HISTORY: 17-year-old male with cervical spine injury and concern for lower extremity DVT.
No intraluminal echogenic material is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
Sinus rhythm.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with sensory motor loss following accident, for further evaluation.
FINDINGS: At C4-5 level, there is increased signal seen within the interspinous ligament and disruption of the ligament identified.
There is mild focal loss of lordosis seen at this level in the cervical spine curvature.
Additionally, there is diffuse bulging of the disc and disc herniation seen at this level indenting the spinal cord.
The spinal cord demonstrates increased signal with areas of increased signal at this level and extending slightly superiorly and inferior to this level.
Additionally, foci of low signal are identified within the spinal cord on T2-weighted images indicative of blood products.
These findings indicate spinal cord contusion.
At other levels in the cervical region, no evidence of disc herniation seen.
No spinal stenosis seen.
Increased signal is seen in the posterior soft tissues secondary to trauma.
IMPRESSION: Findings indicative of disruption of the interspinous ligament at C4-5 level with possible partial interruption of the posterior longitudinal ligament.
Signal changes within the spinal cord indicative of spinal cord contusion.
No evidence of facet joint malalignment.
