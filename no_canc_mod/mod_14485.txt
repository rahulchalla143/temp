This finding suggests cortical dysfunction in these areas and may lead to an increased risk for seizure activity.
This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with thinning/akinesis of the basal half of the inferior wall and hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral wall.
The remaining segments contract well [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is  mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened but no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened and supporting apparatus is fibrotic/calcified, but no mitral stenosis is suggested.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
MRI Brain: No acute areas of brain ischemia are [**Date Range 12681**].
Tiny low signal intensity region seen along the ventral surface of the medulla, possibly acute versus chronic blood products.
This report was given to medicine resident in charge of the patient on [**2191-2-22**] at 2:15 p.m.  Brief Hospital Course: 73 yo man with MMP here s/p cardiopulm arrest.
Following multiple discussions with family regarding patient's intubation and resuscitation despite legal documentation, it was decided initially that patient should be evaluated by neurology to assist with determination of anoxic brain injury and recovery of function as well as echocardiogram to determine whether or not a massive myocardial infarction may have occurred.
Echocardiogram revealed no significant akinesis or dyskinesis, however, significant MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12681**], and inferiolateral hypokinesis.
MRI brain did not identify significant evidence of diffuse anoxic brain injury, however EEG revealed spike and slow wave suggesting anoxic encephalopathy and seizure activity.
Despite weaning of sedating medications, patient continued to have only minimal neurological function, and family decided on hospital day 6 to extubate and withdraw care.
