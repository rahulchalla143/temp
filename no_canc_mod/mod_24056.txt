Admission Date:  [**2129-1-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-1-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-10-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: History: From Daughter, served as interpreter PCP: [**Name Initial (NameIs) 65249**]  70 y.o.
female with COPD on 4L home O2 and BiPAP, CHF (s/p ICD), CAD s/p CABG, HTN, presents with dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory distress.
Her daughter notes that she became gradually fatigued over the past week.
Three days prior to admission her daughter noted that she was more short of breath and called her in the middle of the night complaining of dyspnea on each of the nights prior to admission.
CXR with pulmonary Edema.
She was admitted to the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure and CHF.
ROS: POSITIVE: non-compliant with low Na diet, +PND over the last 3 days, DOE with walking 10 feet, mild wheezing.
Past Medical History: 1) CAD s/p 4-vessel CABG in [**2119**] 2) CHF with EF 40% by echo at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2128-8-25**] with mild TR, mild Pulm HTN (38mm Hg) 3) DM Type 2 4) HTN 5) COPD on home O2, BIPAP with multiple past admissions for non-compliance with BiPAP and pCO2 in the 70-80 range 6) Schizophrenia 7) L3 fracture in [**2127**] 8) Runs of symptomatic VT s/p ICD in [**1-2**]  Social History: Do not Intubate.
Can only take 10 steps prior to having severe dyspnea.
No murmurs Pulm: Rales at bases b/l ABD: Soft NT/ND.
Mild hepatic pulsatility Ext: Trace edema b/l Neuro: Motor [**6-3**] at all flex/ex.
Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2129-1-7**] CXR - Congestive heart failure with perihilar and interstitial edema as well as small pleural effusions [**2129-1-9**] CXR - Again seen is an ICD with lead terminating in the right ventricle.
There continues to be a hazy bilateral vasculature with pulmonary vascular redistribution consistent with fluid overload/CHF.
Compared to the film from the prior day, there has been no significant change [**2129-1-10**] ECHO - The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal anteroseptal and apical hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
[**2129-1-11**] CXR - Improved opacity within the right lung base, likely due to resolving atelectasis.
female with OSA/COPD (on home O2 with BIPAP at night), schizophrenia, CAD s/p CABG, CHF with EF 40% presents with dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory distress > CHF flare.
1) Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress:  She has severe COPD and sleep apnea on 3L home O2 and 14/8 nasal BIPAP.
According to her daughter, she had not worn her BiPAP for 1 week prior to admission likely accounting for her hypercarbia.
He bicarbonate level of 38 suggests that she had been compensating for a chronic respiratory acidosis for some time.
Over the next 2 days she was able to be weaned to BiPAP at night only (using her home nasal BIPAP mask) and it was decided that we would not check blood gases unless she had a change in mental status and would not prematurely start BiPAP (prior to the evening) unless her pH was <7.3.
2) COPD Flare.
3) CHF with EF 40%.
No evidence of ischemia by signs or symptoms.
Her blood sugars became more elevated after initiation of the steroid taper.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
