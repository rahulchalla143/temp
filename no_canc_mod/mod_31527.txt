Hyponatremia:  She was treated initially in the ED with aggressive IV resuscitation with 3L normal saline, bringing her sodium from 115 to 119 and improving her mental status.
The most plausible etiology seemed to be a combination of volume depletion due to her diarrhea, thus stimulating ADH secretion, combined with excessive free water intake leading to her hyponatremia.
An endocrine consult was obtained and they did not believe there was an endocrine process (primary pituitary process, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency) responsible for her hyponatremia.
She was advised to aim for a goal of [**1-26**] liters of fluid intake per day depending on her physical activity and to follow up with her PCP to have her sodium level checked.
If you experience symptoms similar to those that brought you into the emergency room (blurry vision, dizziness, and nausea) you should seek immediate medical attention to have your sodium level checked.
