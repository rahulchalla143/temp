Median nerve decompression left and right wrists.
Sclera anicteric.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: Limited exam, CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness, +BS EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
DISCHARGE EXAM: Tele: No events GEN: NAD CV: RRR, NL S1/S2, II/VI softsystolic murmur, JVP flat PULM: CTAB ABD: NTND, no rigidity, rebound, NABS EXT: WWP, scant peripheral edema NEURO: A/Ox3, non focal.
The hilar contours and pleural surfaces are normal.
No pneumothorax is present.
A left-sided pacer terminates with its leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
A low thoracic vertebral body compression fracture has cement from a vertebroplasty within it.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
There is no appreciable mediastinal widening.
No pneumothorax.
Small right pleural effusion is new.
There is no pulmonary edema.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements, unchanged.
- [**7-29**] ECHO Conclusions Preimplantation: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Mean gradient across the new aortic valve is 9 mmHg.
Paravalvular aortic regurgitation is mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+), with trace central aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
- [**7-31**] ECHO Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Well seated aortic CoreValve with normal transvalvular gradients and mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and preserved global biventricular systolic function.
At least mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-7-31**], the findings are similar (severity of mitral regurgitation was underestimated on the prior study).
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 88yo caucasian female with h/o extensive vascular diseases including CAD, PVD, renal artery stenosis, mesenteric ischemia, and known aortic stenosis admitted for elective TAVI/CoreValve placement.
ACTIVE ISSUES # CoreValve placement Pt p/w critical aortic stenosis, with aortic valve opening 0.8-1 cm2 and mean gradient 33 mmHg.
Pt underwent standard preop preparation.
There was no residue transaortovavular gradient after the valve placement.
There was no new changes seen on daily EKG.
She was gently diuresed as needed for fluid overload.
- ECHO at one week post-op showed similar findings with minimal AR.
She had UA with large leuk esterase.
CHRONIC ISSUES # HTN: Patient's home blood pressure medication were restarted gradually post-op.
# Others: Patient had a documented history of atrophic gastritis, multifocal gait disorder, hypothyroidism.
We continued her home medication for these conditions without complications.
