At the outside hospital the patient was noted to have elevated in troponin to 4.8 and EKG changes such as elevations in inferior leads.
On presentation, the catheterization was consistent with cardiogenic shock, notable for 95% stenosis in the proximal LAD, 70% stenosis in the lateral circumflex, with a right dominant system.
ABDOMEN:  Guaiac positive, diffuse tenderness to palpation.
EXTREMITIES:  Notable for a 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
EKG on presentation was notable for atrial fibrillation at 107 beats per minute with a right axis deviation, normal intervals, 1.5-mm ST elevations in leads 2, 3, and AVF; 0.5 -mm ST depressions in 1 and AVL.
Chest x-ray was notable for left lower lobe opacity and perihilar infiltrates.
On [**2183-9-21**] the Department of Surgery was consulted for question of ischemic bowel.
Recommendations:  CT abdomen and pelvis, optimizing hemodynamic parameters.
The patient was intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure on [**2183-9-21**].
She was begun on Dopamine and Levophed for hypertension.
The patient was switched from Levophed to Pitressin and Digoxin was begun for rate control of rapid atrial fibrillation.
On [**2183-9-22**], Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for worsening right cavitary lesion on chest x-ray.
On [**2183-9-23**], the patient experienced worsening respiratory status.
Serum lactic acid levels rose to a high of 12.4 likely due to ischemic valve secondary to hypoperfusion.
On [**2183-9-26**], the patient was noted to be quite tenuous in terms of hemodynamic and respiratory requirements.
On [**2183-9-26**], the MICU service was called for the patient unresponsive in asystole with no pulse or heart rate.
