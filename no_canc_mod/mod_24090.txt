Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.
Short-term radiographic follow-up of the small pneumothorax is recommended.
Prevertebral fluid/soft tissue thickening extending from the  atlanto-occipital articulation to the C4 vertebral body with signal abnormality involving the interspinous ligaments at C3-4.
No cord signal abnormality identified.
Minimal degenerative changes of the cervical spine as described above without evidence of spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing at any level.
Asymmetric prominence of the left thyroid lobe.
[**2146-2-27**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Grayscale and color Doppler ultrasounds were performed.
There is a non-occlusive thrombus in the right common femoral veins.
[**2146-2-26**] UGI SGL CONTRAST W/ KUB No evidence of contrast extravasation along the course of the esophagus.
[**2146-2-25**] HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT Left forearm two views and three views of the left wrist demonstrate fractures involving the base of the proximal phalanx of the ring finger and to the third metacarpal head.
There is also a small fracture off the ulnar styloid.
There is irregularity of the radial styloid with suggestion of the small nondisplaced fracture which exits out the lateral articular surface, best seen on the oblique view.
Images of the forearm demonstrate no fractures in the region of the ulnar radial shaft or in the region of the elbow.
Subcutaneous emphysema on that side.
Right upper lobe volume loss.
[**2146-2-25**] TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) LEFT Patient is status post left total knee arthroplasty.
There are no signs of hardware-related complications.
There is a fracture dislocation of the ankle with a vertically oriented fracture through the medial malleolus and a transversely oriented fracture through the lateral malleolus, 1.5 cm above the tibiotalar joint.
There is abnormal widening of the ankle mortise suggesting a syndesmotic ligament and injury.
Dedicated images of the left foot show no displaced fractures.
No fracture or hemorrhage.
Large subgaleal hematoma at the cranial vertex, with numerous skin lacerations.
Extensive left-sided rib fractures, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema and loculated pneumothorax.
Pulmonary contusion and areas of atelectasis or aspiration.
Acute pulmonary embolus in left lower lobar artery.
Left transverse process fracture of L1 and possibly L2.
No fracture or malalignment.
Moderate degenerative change of the cervical spine.
Extensive subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumomediastinum better evaluated on concurrent CT torso.
Numerous left-sided rib fractures, the most displaced being left 9th ribfracture.
Pneumomediastinum, small left pneumothorax, no tension.
Leftlower lobar pulmonary artery somewhat eccentric filling defect; may represent non-acute pulmonary embolus.
Her head and cervical spine imaging studies did not reveal any acute injuries.
CT imaging of her chest however revealed an acute pulmonary embolus in left lower lobar artery; a lower extremity ultrasound was done to evaluate for thrombus which showed a non-occlusive clot in the right common femoral veins.
Orthopedics was consulted and she was taken to the operating room on [**2-26**] for repair of her left ankle bimalleolar fracture with shear medial tibia fracture.
On [**2-27**] she was taken back to the OR for an IVC filter placement.
Plastics was consulted for the open fractures to left hand and large open dorsal wound.
The wound was irrigated extensively; wound edges approximated with 4-0 Ethilon and Prolene interrupted sutures.
The wound was dressed and splinted.
She was also evaluated by the Acute Pain service for thoracic epidural catheter given her multiple rib fractures.
Hematology was consulted for concern re: hypercoagulability given the pulmonary embolus and DVT found on imaging at time of admission.
It was noted by Hematology that the inferior vena cava filter offered theoretically sufficient protection against recurrent pulmonary embolism in the meantime and precludes the necessity to monitor thrombus migration.
Because she has an IVC filter it was felt by trauma Attending that she did not require Lovenox as a bridge.

Followup Instructions: Follow up in 2 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Trauma surgery for evaluation of your rib fractures.
You will need an upright end expiratory chest xray for this appointment.
