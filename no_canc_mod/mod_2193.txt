[**2129-6-8**] CXR Portable AP IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with patchy basilar opacities, greater on the left than right, probably attributable to atelectasis, but not entirely specific.
If pulmonary symptoms are present or other concern for pneumonia, than when clinically appropriate, short-term followup chest radiographs, preferably with standard PA and lateral technique if possible, could be considered  [**2129-6-11**] CXR PA and lateral PENDING  Brief Hospital Course: 85 M w/ hx of ESRD on HD, CAD, afib, CVA w/ residual R sided weakness who presented from [**Month/Day/Year 2286**] with hypotension.
Hypotension was felt to most likely be secondary to hypovolemia as the patient had no clear e/o infection (WBC normal, no fevers).
The patients blood pressure remained stable and he remained afebrile and was transferred to the general medical service.
Thereafter, BP were normal with the exception of one event during hemodialysis; this episode of hypotension was attributed to not taking midodrine prior to hemodialysis as the patient normally does.
As the patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable, the antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was discharged home.
#Hx of CAD: no e/o active ischemia.
No EKG changes.
A cardiac evaluation for heart failure was attempted; troponin 0.05 but the patient declined further cardiac biomarkers and ECHO.
# Atrial Fibrillation- Patient has a known hx of a fib in the past.
His was intermittently in atrial fib throughout this admission.
No e/o heart failure on exam.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 12731**],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of low blood pressure during hemodialysis.
It is unclear what caused these low blood pressures.
We do not think you have an infection, and we could not complete our tests of your heart function.
