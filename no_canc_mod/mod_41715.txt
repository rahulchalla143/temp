He was found to have coronary artery disease and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.
Past Medical History: Aortic stenosis, moderate, calculated [**Location (un) 109**] 1.4 cm2 Atrial fibrillation on Pradaxa since [**2149-4-29**] Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Gout (pt not aware, noted in records) Arthritis Cataract, bilateral S/P left knee replacement S/P appendectomy S/p carpal tunnel surgery  Social History: Race:Caucasian Last Dental Exam:3 months ago, will call dentist to have dental clearance faxed to office Lives with:Wife Contact: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 15582**] (wife) Phone# [**Telephone/Fax (1) 110537**] Occupation: Retired elevator mechanic Cigarettes: Smoked no [] yes [x] Hx:quit 40 years ago Other Tobacco use:denies ETOH: Quit one month ago, Former daily ETOH 2-3 beers Illicit drug use:denies  Family History: Premature coronary artery disease - non contributory  Physical Exam: Pulse:68 Resp:18  O2 sat:98/RA B/P  Right:87/52    Left:83/54 Height:5'[**47**]"     Weight:190 lbs  General: Skin: Dry [x] intact [x] HEENT: EOMI [x] Neck:  Supple [x] Full ROM [x] Chest: Lungs clear bilaterally [x] Heart: RRR [x]   Murmur [x] grade 2 systolic Abdomen: Soft [x] non-distended [x] non-tender [x]  bowel sounds + [x] Extremities: Warm [x], well-perfused [x]  Edema [] _____ Varicosities: None [x] Neuro: Grossly intact [x] Pulses: Femoral      Right: p  Left: p Radial       Right: p   Left: p  Carotid Bruit        Right:  -  Left: -  Pertinent Results: [**5-21**] TEE: LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Conclusions PRE BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.4 cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a bioprosthesis located in the aortic position.
There may be very trace aortic insufficiency though it was seen only after initial separation from bypass and its source could not be determined.
He was a-paced over Sinus Bradycardia and required Neo and volume for hypotension and low Cardiac Index.
Mr.[**Known lastname 15582**] has a history of afib/flutter and went back into it on post-op day two.
He was started briefly on amio but due to hypotension this was discontinued and he was then started on Digoxin with good effect.
His pacing wires and Chest Tubes were removed per protocol, without difficulty.
He had a slight drop in his platlet count but this has since resolved.
[**Month (only) 116**] want to consider future ablation for atrial flutter.
