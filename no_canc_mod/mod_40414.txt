HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old woman with lupus scleroderma, chronically on steroids, with multiple past pneumonias; who, two days prior to admission started feeling extremely fatigued.
Her husband noted her temperature at home to be up to 103 degrees.
He brought her to the Emergency Department for evaluation where she developed respiratory distress and was intubated.
She denied not have any nausea, vomiting, or cough while at home.
She has had multiple pneumonias in the past; usually levofloxacin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae and has had multiple sputums with Mycobacterium avium intracellulare.
She does not have a history of tuberculosis.
Severe gastroesophageal reflux disease.
She also had revealed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2123-3-9**] for pancreatitis; at which time she received sphincterotomy of a stenosis in the major papilla.
She is allergic to PENICILLAMINE (note that she is not allergic to PENICILLIN).
PLAQUENIL causes visual disturbances.
She can walk eight flights of stairs without dyspnea, although she gets occlusion fatigue.
She has had chronic diarrhea since her colectomy in [**2108**].
Chest revealed coarse breath sounds on the right but with good air movement.
Immunoglobulin levels showed severe immunoglobulin A deficiency.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed right-sided multifocal pneumonia.
A chest CT angiogram showed no evidence for pulmonary embolus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Assessment and plan revealed a 67-year-old woman with a history of frequent streptococcus pneumoniae who now comes in with complaints of cough, fever, and respiratory difficulty.
The patient was intubated in the Emergency Department on [**2123-3-30**] because of impending respiratory failure.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  She was initially hypotensive and required Levophed pressor in order to maintain her blood pressure.
NEUROLOGY:  She has a history of seizure disorder; and per her online outpatient notes, it appeared that her neurologist had been trying to transition her from Dilantin to Keppra.
We opted to load her with Dilantin and to maintain her at a therapeutic level given our concerns about a possible seizure in the setting of acute illness.
PULMONARY:  The patient's chest x-ray on admission revealed a large right-sided multilobar pneumonia.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  She had a pan-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae and was therefore started on levofloxacin 500 mg q.d.
She has a history of chronic sinusitis.
A head CT was performed which showed evidence of chronic sinusitis as well as multiple sinus surgeries.
Her primary gastroenteritis (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who had performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on her last month advised that she simply needed an elective repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography after she was extubated and more stable.
Per her family, she is believed to have chronic gastritis and to have a certain baseline blood loss through the presumed slow gastrointestinal bleeding.
