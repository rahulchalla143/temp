Admission Date:  [**2101-6-3**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2040-5-3**]       Sex:  M  Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61 year old male with a past medical history significant for throat cancer, status post surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy with a history of minor aspiration events, who presented to an outside hospital on [**2101-5-29**], status post a mild choking episode while eating while in [**State 48158**] with cough, hypoxia, shortness of breath.
He was found to have a severe right sided infiltrate on chest x-ray.
He was ruled out for tuberculosis.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] ICU on [**2101-6-3**], and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
He had persistent fevers in the ICU.
Because of his significant travel history, serologies for coccidioides and strongyloides were sent.
There was a question of possible drug fever because of persistent fever and persistent elevated peripheral eosinophils.
However, since transfer out of the unit, he has been afebrile for a total of two days.
He was extubated on [**2101-6-13**], with a slow wean likely secondary to his severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - normocephalic and atraumatic.
Neck - 2+ carotids, supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Respiratory - crackles at the right base greater than the left base, some bronchial breath sounds on the right upper border.
Extremities no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 61 year old admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit from [**Hospital 48159**] Hospital for hypoxic respiratory failure and severe right sided pneumonia.
Past medical history is significant for throat cancer, status post resection/reconstructive surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy in remission, history of minor aspirations, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sciatica, malaria which recurs annually (former Green Beret).
He was intubated shortly after his admission here and his chest x-ray was significant for infiltrate throughout the right lung.
On transfer to the floor, his severe aspiration pneumonia was improving both clinically and radiographically.
Aspiration pneumonia - This was thought to be secondary to aspiration, however, given his travel history, he was worked up for coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis.
He was intubated on [**2101-6-3**], upon admission and extubated on [**2101-6-12**], with a slow wean from the ventilator secondary to his severe underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Drug reaction was considered given the peripheral eosinophilia and malaria was also considered but parasite smear was negative.
The A line which grew out coagulase negative Staphylococcus was pulled.
He remained afebrile and he was using an incentive spirometer at the bedside.
The patient continues to present with severe to profound pharyngeal dysphagia.
They recommended a CT scan of the oral cavity and neck with contrast to rule out tumor recurrence which was done and revealed no new mass.
They also recommended an outpatient barium swallow to rule out esophageal mass or obstruction.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - He was continued on Flovent, Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers.
Eosinophilia - The patient was noted to have rising peripheral eosinophils up to the low 30s on [**2101-6-12**].
At around that time, he also developed maculopapular rash consistent with a drug reaction only on his abdomen.
The differential diagnosis included a drug reaction, however, he only had a rash for three to four days and it resolved while on Levofloxacin and Flagyl (vasculitis).
Serologies have been negative and he has no renal issues, a parasitic infection (parasite smear was negative, however, strongyloides is still pending), fungal, coccidioides and histoplasmosis workup are pending, HIV test was negative and a cortisol stimulation test was also negative.
Infectious disease was following the patient and they felt that the slow response to the antibiotics and the high grade eosinophilia despite withdrawal of beta lactam prompted consideration of atypical pathogens, example, strongyloides-related pneumonia, coccidioides (which can cause eosinophilia and cavities), histoplasmosis or just refractory pneumonia with superimposed eosinophilia from occult parasitic infestation, example strongyloides.
They also felt that in concert with the thrombocytosis that he has that this reactive thrombocytosis and eosinophilia may be secondary to strongyloides or coccidioides.
Hematology/oncology was consulted because of the eosinophilia and they felt that this was drug related since he had a typical rash and history of an antibiotic reaction, however, the patient was not sure which antibiotic he had a reaction to in the past.
Thrombocytosis - High platelets were noted  which continued to climb despite clinical improvement of the infection.
Elevated liver function tests - His liver function tests were elevated while in the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit.
Electrocardiographic changes on admission - It was noted by the ICU resident that these electrocardiographic changes did resolve quickly and they involved some T wave and nonspecific ST changes.
FOLLOW-UP:  He will need to follow-up with his ENT doctor to obtain a barium swallow as an outpatient to rule out esophageal mass or obstruction.
Severe aspiration pneumonia complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation for approximately ten days.
Thrombocytosis - likely reactive.
Eosinophilia - likely a drug reaction though may be related to strongyloides or coccidioidomycosis with serologies pending at the time of dictation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
