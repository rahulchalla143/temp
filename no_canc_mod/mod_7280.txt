Since the previous tracing of [**2114-8-1**] sinus tachycardia and modest ST-T wave changes are both now present.
Increased resistive indices within the transplanted kidney, which are elevated compared to [**2114-7-18**] ultrasound.
Mild pelvocaliectasis of the transplanted kidney.
Multifocal pneumonia.
No cavitation or obstruction.
A 9-mm upper tracheal nodule contiguous with possible esophageal mass.
Esophageal dysmotility, as described above.
No evidence of esophageal stricture, intraluminal mass, or mucosal abnormality.
- EGD [**2116-5-1**] Procedure: 	The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The patient was administered moderate sedation.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct visualization until the third part of the duodenum was reached.
There were no complications.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 20083**] is a 48yo M with history of HIV and diabetic nephropathy s/p living-related transplant [**7-25**] who was found down at home and was found down with improvement after narcan and found to have acute kidney injury, elevated K that was treated and hypotension with report of coffee ground emesis.
# Acute kidney injury: The patient normally has a creatinine around 1.8 s/p living related transplant, but after being found down had a creatinine of 3, which rose during the course of his admission initally; he was thought to have ATN secondary to volume depletion in setting or recent bowel prep as well as dehydration.
# GI bleed: Pt guaiac positive in ED likely related to recent colonoscopy or prior rectal exam at OSH.
Concern for UGI bleed given report of dark emesis, but pt HCT is stable, GI lavage is neg and he denies abdominal pain, bloody stool, black stool or lightheadedness.
An endoscopy was performed which was completely normal, without any sign of mass or bleed.
Was initially covered with Vanc/cefepime cover for possible aspiration PNA.
A CT of the Chest was shown to be consistent with multifocal pneumonia, but also incidentally commented on an esophgeal/tracheal mass.
UPon discharge he was not short of breath and satting well on room air, as compared to his initial presentation when he had required 4 L O2.
#Esophageal mass: On CT scan, the patient was noted to have an esophageal mass with some possible connection to a very small tracheal infiltrate, concerning for malignancy.
A barium swallow was performed, which only showed some esophageal dysmotility, but no signs of a mass or fistula.
The EGD for presumed UGIB also did not reveal any signs of mass or fistula.
Given the fact it was presumed the patient had an aspiration event, the tracheal infiltrate was presumed to be aspirated content from his aspiration event.
# Hyperglycemia: Pt with insulin pump at home wtih fingersticks ranging 100-200 usually presenting with hyperglycemia.
His hyperglycemia was though to be secondary to the stress response of infection.
HAART medication dosing decreased secondary to known renal dysfunction; upon discharge, he was still taking less than his usual home dose of Truvada; this will need to be uptitrated to his normal home dose once his kidneys fully recover.
# Substance abuse: It came to light during this admission that the patient had purposefully taken all of the narcotics prescribed to him post his anoscopy simultaneously in order to "get high."
Social work and psychiatry was consulted; psychiatry did not find any acute issues, and recommended continuing the patient's current dosing of psychoactive medication.
PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**], and will help to make arrnagement for further outpateint psychiatric help.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia Acute Tubular necrosis (kidney injury)   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 20083**],  You were admitted to the hospital after you had overdosed on pain medications given to you for your anoscopy and sigmoidoscopy.
You were unconscious and developed a pneumonia from inhaling some of your stomach contents.
You also developed kidney failure afterwards, which has since improved.
On one of your CT scans, there was a concern for an esophageal mass.
You had an endoscopy that showed no problems.
