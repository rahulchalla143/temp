Physical Exam: On Admission  Tc 97.3, HR 105, BP 147/95, RR 18, O2sat 97RA Genl: NAD CV: RRR, no mrg Resp: crackles at Right base, good excursion throughout, no wheeze Abd: s/nt/nd; well-healed Chevron incision Extr: no c/c/e  LABS: Na 139, K 4.9, Cl 115, CO2 pend, BUN 63, Creat 2.3, Glc 111 WBC 8.8, Hct 33.5, Plt 237 AST 10, ALT 9, Alkphos 1.3, Tbili 3.2   Pertinent Results: Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2175-3-28**] 12:05 PM IMPRESSION: Diffuse hazy opacity in bilateral lung bases.
While the findings may be due to a slightly atypical distribution of pulmonary edema, focal infiltrates in particular the right perihilar and left retrocardiac regions cannot be entirely excluded.
Radiology Report LUNG SCAN Study Date of [**2175-3-28**]  IMPRESSION: Low likelihood ratio for acute pulmonary embolus.
Radiology Report BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2175-3-28**] 1:56 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT in bilateral lower extremities.
New widespread ground-glass attenuation, septal thickening and peribronchiolar foci of consolidation.
The constellation of findings may all be due to an opportunistic infection in this immune suppressed patient, such as viral or PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] hydrostatic edema coexisting with pneumonia is also possible.
Widespread interstitial fibrosis, probably unchanged compared to recent CT but difficult to assess in the setting of acute lung disease.
Status post hepatic transplantation with decrease amount of ascites, but incomplete assessment of the liver on this dedicated chest CT study.
If evaluation of liver is desired clinically, dedicated ultrasound could be considered.
New small pericardial and dependent right pleural effusions and minimal increase in dependent left pleural effusion.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2175-3-30**] at 2:41:18 PM There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
Rapid progression of widespread bilateral alveolar opacities, superimposed upon underlying interstitial abnormality.
A component of hydrostatic edema is also possible.
Persistent small right pleural effusion, but no evidence of pneumothorax.
Widespread combined alveolar and interstitial opacities show mild to moderate improvement in the right perihilar region, but slight worsening in the left retrocardiac area.
Right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size and small left effusion is unchanged.
No hydronephrosis or stone.
Mild fullness in the left renal pelvis.
Small simple cyst in the left kidney.
Markedly thickened bladder wall, which may be due to symmetric bladder wall hypertrophy from outflow obstruction or spastic bladder neuropathy.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %).
Atypical pulmonary edema cannot be ruled out, would be improved.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**4-8**] for shortness of breath, tachycardia and increased O2 requirement.
Initial CXR on [**4-8**] concerning for a RLL pneumonia, A V/Q scan was done as well as lower extremity venous duplex studies which were low probability for PE and did not demonstrate venous thrombosis in the lower extremities.
A chest CT done on [**3-29**] showed widespread global ground glass opacities.
The pt was transported to the ICU on [**2175-3-29**] due to increased work of breathing and persistently low CO2 on ABG.
A trans thoracic echo was performed on [**3-30**] which revealed global dysfunction and an EF of 25-30% which has previously been >55%.
