FINDINGS:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
Bilateral basal ganglia infarcts are unchanged from prior exam.
Metallic streak artifact from basilar tip aneurysm clip is present.
Post-right temporal craniotomy changes are present along with encephalomalacia of the right temporal lobe.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent compatible with age-related involutional changes.
The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate moderate mucosal thickening in the left sphenoid sinus.
No acute intracranial process.
Old infarct and encephalomalacia as described above.
Left sphenoid sinus disease.
COMPARISON:  [**2121-8-22**] chest radiograph and chest CTA.
The aorta is tortuous and aneurysmally dilated, better seen on the prior CT.
In the interval, there is worsening pulmonary edema which is now moderate to severe in extent, with increased size of bilateral pleural effusions which are small to moderate on the right and trace on the left.
Ill-defined airspace opacities within the lung bases could reflect atelectasis though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.
No large pneumothorax is detected, but again the right lung apex is obscured.
Mild compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body is again noted as well as within an upper lumbar vertebral body.
IMPRESSION: Worsening congestive heart failure with moderate to severe pulmonary edema, increased size of bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and bibasilar airspace opacities which could reflect atelectasis though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded.
CXR portable [**9-6**] Final Report REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with coronary artery disease, CVA, hypertension and atrial fibrillation.
There is substantial interval improvement in pulmonary edema which is still present, mild to moderate, associated with bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 65F with PMHx significant for recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation (discharged [**2121-8-26**]), CVA with residual R facial droop/dysphagia s/p G-tube, and CAD s/p PCI of RCA in [**2114**], who presents to the ED from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with palpitations and suprapubic pressure, and was found to have a UTI and afib with rapid ventricular response.
ACTIVES ISSUES: # Atrial fribrillation w/RVR: Patient reports intermittent palpitations since her discharge on [**8-26**] and states that they were worse on the day of admission.
Also reports increased shortness of breath for the 2 days prior to admission; CXR in the ED shows worsening CHF with moderate to severe pulmonary edema and increased size of bilateral pleural effusions (R>L).
She had a TTE on [**2121-8-25**] that showed new dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 30%.
Possible that her RVR has led to worsening pulmonary edema and symptoms.
Etiology of afib thought to be hyperthyroidism which is now being treated; she currently has evidence of a UTI, which could be cause of RVR.
Of note, she is not anticoagulated given history of multiple extensive intracranial hemorrhages as well as history severe GI bleed; cardioversion was deferred as well.
After loading dose of digoxin, tachycardia resolved to HR in 60-90s, however, loading digoxin was elevated level (1.6, goal is 0.8), thus digoxin was stopped until digoxin levels were therapeutic (digoxin level 0.7 on [**2121-9-15**]).
She was treated for a urinary tract infection would could have been the trigger in addition to her dilated cardiomyopathy.
# Urinary tract infection: Patient reports developing suprapubic pressure/lower abdominal discomfort on the afternoon of presentation.
Denies any dysuria or frequency, but does endorse sweats and is mildly diaphoretic on exam.
No rebound or guarding.
Urinalysis suggestive of infection with 0 epis, moderate leuk, negative nitrite, moderate bacteria, WBC 13, RBC 1.
Pt grew enterococcus and pan-sensitive E.coli in urine in [**2117**].
Follow up urine culture showed alpha-hemolytic organisms c/w lactobacillus and strep >100,000.
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF: Patient has recently diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy with global hypokinesis and EF 30% on [**2121-8-25**] TTE.
Currently has evidence of volume overload with worsening pulmonary edema on CXR and hypoxia (92% 4L NC); likely related to afib with RVR.
DC-ed lisinopril due to insufficient systolic BP room in the setting of metoprolol uptitrate and dilt for afib.
# Questionable pneumonia: CXR with RLL infiltrate; atelectasis vs. pleural effusion vs. pneumonia.
Patient has no clinical signs of PNA -- no cough, fever, or elevated WBC, however, she does have known chronic aspiration and is at increased risk for aspiration pneumonia.
She was covered with levofloxacin both urinary tract infection and ?
# Transaminitis: Patient has elevated AST/ALT.
No RUQ pain to suggest biliary pathology.
It is thought that this elevation may be due to hepatic congestion in the context of pulmonary edema vs methimazole.
# Hyperthyroidism: Diagnosed during admission earlier this month; thought to be a contributor to her new atrial fibrillation.
She is scheduled for endocrinology follow-up, and will need repeat testing including thyroid function tests, spot urine iodine/Cr, and serum metanephrines for adrenal incidentaloma.
Statin was deferred due to transamnitis.
# H/o CVA w/chronic aspiration: Strict NPO, all meds through g-tube, gets tube feeds.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Follow-up with endocrinology regarding thyroid and incidental adrenal mass from prior CT abdomen - The patient should undergo lab testing in 2 weeks for the following: [ ] TFTs [ ] spot urine iodine/cr [ ] consider blood work for adrenal incidentaloma such as pheochromocytoma screening at the same time [ ] follow-up digoxin levels on [**9-17**] or 4th [**2120**] for goal of 0.8 blood dig levels - consider anticoagulation with coumadin as outpatient for atrial fibrillation after risk/benefits discussion - consider addition of statin and ACEi for systolic CHF if liver function remains normal and BP room for lisinopril - repeat CXR in [**3-21**] weeks to establish clearance of pulmonary edema and any possible pneumonia  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain or fever 2.
Outpatient Lab Work On [**9-28**], please check TSH, T4, T, spot urine iodine/creatine, and plasma free metanephrines ICD-9: 242.9, Thyrotoxicosis  Please fax results to: MALA [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16956**], MD Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1803**] Fax:([**Telephone/Fax (1) 86540**] Patient has appointment on MONDAY [**2121-10-6**] at 9:30 AM to follow-up results   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid ventricular rate, and Pulmonary edema Secondary Diagnoses: Hyperthyroidism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted with palpitations and were found to have a rapid heart rate with an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection which we treated with an oral antibiotic.
