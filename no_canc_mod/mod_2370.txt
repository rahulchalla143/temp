Admission Date:  [**2128-6-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2128-7-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2067-10-24**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old white female with past medical history of coronary artery disease status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft, saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to D1 and saphenous vein graft to OM1 in [**2120**], re-do in [**2123**], congestive heart failure, with her last ejection fraction less than 20%, likely secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, mechanical mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation (anticoagulated), status post DDD pacemaker in [**2123**], status post pacemaker replacement three weeks ago, hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, complete occlusion of abdominal aorta, chronic renal insufficiency, the patient is chronically on home dopamine therapy since [**2126-8-19**].
On Sunday, the 10th, the patient starting developing watery diarrhea and mild cramps.
She was having about three to four episodes of loose stools a day.
On the morning of that day she was found to be hypotensive and confused and found stooling in her bed.
Did not note her stool to have melena or bright red blood per rectum.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2120**] status post re-do in [**2123**].
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20.
Left atrial dilation, left ventricular dilation, right ventricular dilation, decreased left ventricular and right ventricular systolic function.
Greater than 4 mm atheroma in the aortic arch.
Trace aortic regurgitation.
Mitral valve replacement.
Mechanical mitral valve.
Pacemaker (DDD with atrial tachycardia overdrive capability) 5.
Diabetes mellitus not insulin dependent.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Patient has had recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmia on her pacemaker which was aborted with pacing overdrive.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Found to have an arteriovenous malformation which was cauterized.
She had no lymphadenopathy.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention was appreciated.
2-3/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border with a mechanical click.
There were no masses, no guarding, no rebound, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  There was no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
No signs and symptoms of failure.
No pulmonary infiltrates.
She does have basilar atelectasis.
Cardiovascular:  Ischemia-wise, it was possible that the hypotension could have been due to an ischemic event although this was unlikely given the patient had no chest pain so she was continued on her aspirin, beta blocker, statin.
Her ACE inhibitor was held secondary to her increase in creatinine over her baseline.
She had no signs or symptoms of failure.
The hypotension could have been explained by her hypovolemia secondary to diarrhea volume loss.
The patient had been given 1.5 liters of fluid in the Emergency Room.
Given her history of congestive heart failure and ejection fraction less than 20, it was felt that more fluids were not necessary and her diuretics were restarted that evening in a goal to keep the patient uvolemic.
The patient had no other volume issues.
Rhythm-wise, the patient had a paced rhythm.
The patient has a history of mitral valve replacement.
It was felt that the diarrhea could have been an atypical manifestation of her recurrent sepsis or possibly that this could be Clostridium difficile given her recent antibiotic use.
It was felt that this was likely due to dehydration.
She had no other heme positive stools so no further action was taken at this time.
She was weaned off oxygen, given an incentive spirometer and had no other active pulmonary issues.
Diabetes:  The patient is a non-insulin dependent diabetic.
As the patient had been afebrile throughout the hospital course, had had no further episodes of diarrhea and was on her baseline home doses of dopamine with stable blood pressure, it was felt that the patient was stable to go home with close follow up.
Her diarrhea was likely secondary to a viral gastroenteritis.
If she experienced any fevers, chills or any further the Emergency Room.
If she felt that her heart rhythm had become irregular or she was having difficulties with her pacemaker, to contact her M.D.
If she had any worsening heart failure symptoms, contact her M.D.
If she was lightheaded, having difficulty thinking or any to the Emergency Room.
Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Mitral valve replacement.
Anemia ?
Peripheral vascular disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Chronic occlusion of the abdominal aorta.
