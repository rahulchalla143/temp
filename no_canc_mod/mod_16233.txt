Head CT [**4-24**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Compared to one day prior, there is increased edema within the right frontal lobe with increased herniation of the brain parenchyma through the right frontal calvarial defect.
There is slight bowing of the septum pellucidum towards the right, however, no significant midline shift or subfalcine herniation.
The basilar cisterns are difficult to evaluate due to streak artifact from the bullet fragments in the right frontotemporal area, however, appear preserved with no definite evidence of uncal herniation.
Left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage is stable.
Small left-sided subdural hemorrhage is also stable.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Again there is high-density opacification within the right maxillary sinus and moderately extensive opacification within the ethmoidal air cells and sphenoid sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Increasing edema and herniation of the right cerebral hemisphere through the frontoparietal craniectomy defect.
No new subfalcine or uncal herniation.
Head CT [**4-27**]: FINDINGS: Overall, there is minimal change when compared to the previous examinations.
Again seen is a large amount of brain edema, predominantly at the right frontal lobe with transgaleal herniation through the large right frontoparietal craniectomy site.
The left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage is unchanged.
There is no new hemorrhage.
Numerous bullet fragments are all unchanged and the small amount of pneumocephalus seen on [**4-26**] is now resolved.
Numerous facial fractures, soft tissue changes and hyperdense fluid in the right maxillary sinus are all unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Slight increase in the degree of trans-galeal herniation and otherwise minimally changed study.
Head CT [**4-29**]: FINDINGS: Again seen is massive right frontal and temporal and less severe left frontal swelling with edema and mass effect.
There has been a right frontal and temporal craniectomy with herniation of the brain through the craniectomy defect.
There appears to be an extensive infarction of the right middle cerebral artery territory.
There is a small left frontal subdural hematoma that appears slightly larger than on the study of [**2117-4-28**].
However, at its greatest dimension, it measures less than 5 mm and produces only minimal local mass effect.
Mild thickening along the posterior falx may represent a small subdural hematoma in this location.
There is no evidence of new or increased intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Extensive shrapnel from gunshot wound is again seen both the intra- and extra-cranially.
CONCLUSION: Slight increase in the size of a tiny left frontal subdural hematoma.
Status post gunshot wound with extensive right frontal and temporal swelling and right MCA infarction.
Upper Extremity NIS [**4-30**]: IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus in the left basilic and distal cephalic veins, not extending proximally to axillary veins.
No deep venous thrombus of the left upper extremity.
Head CT [**5-1**]: IMPRESSION: Right frontotemporal edema, evolving right MCA infarct, small left subdural hematoma, and left frontal parenchymal hemorrhage are similar to [**2117-4-29**].
Chest X-Ray [**5-1**]: FINDINGS: Since the prior study of one day earlier, multifocal patchy opacities in the perihilar and basilar regions have minimally progressed, and could be due to atelectasis or infection.
Although this study was not optimized for evaluating the vasculature, several filling defects including a segmental branch of the right lower lobar pulmonary artery, compatible with pulmonary embolism.
Mild dependent atelectasis seen at the bases bilaterally.
There is a peripheral noncalcified tiny pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe measuring 3 mm on series 2, image 22.

There is no abdominal fluid collection, free fluid, mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is large amount of stool in the rectum and the sigmoid colon.
Air within the urinary bladder is likely related to recent instrumentation.
There is no free pelvic fluid and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
No CT evidence of infection in the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
Findings highly concerning for pulmonary embolism.
This study was not optimized for evaluation of pulmonary vasculature, and dedicated CTA chest is recommended to confirm the finding and evaluate extent of pulmonary embolism.
Head CT [**5-11**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Limited exam given streak artifact from multiple metallic fragments.
Compared to the prior exam from [**2117-5-4**], there is decreased herniation of the brain parenchyma through the right parietal osseous defect.
However, there still remains a large portion of brain parenchyma extending beyond the confines of the calvarium.
There is slight decrease in effacement of the left lateral ventricle, suggesting decreased edema.
There is continued evolution of the right middle cerebral artery territory infarction with multiple gyriform hemorrhagic foci, slightly increased since prior exam.
There is persistent diffuse cerebral edema with effacement of the basal cisterns.
Compared to prior exam from [**2117-5-4**], there is minimally decreased edema of the brain parenchyma.
Continued evolution of right MCA territory infarct with slightly increased foci of hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was brought to the ER after having sustained gun shot wounds to the head and face.
He went to the OR for emergent surgery and had a temporal lobectomy as well as a craniectomy to leave room for swelling.
He was no longer following commands, but was withdrawing all extremities to pain.
Stat CT showed increased edema and he was aggressively started on 3% saline and mannitol.
Sputum specimen was sent, and grew bacteria requiring the use of Vancomycin and Meropenum for a duration for 14 days.
The left side of his body continued to offer withdrawal of the lower extremity and external rotation of the upper extremity.
On the morning of [**5-4**], the staples of his cranial wound were removed, exclusive of the last 2cm over the ear.
The staples were subsequently removed, and several mattress stitches placed.
He also persistently had low dilantin serum levels despite multiple boluses.
CT Head, Torso, Labs, and LENIS were sent to interrogate for alternate pathologic cause.
He was noted to have a mild transaminitis, though clinically unremarkable.
Non-invasive studies of the upper and lower extremities were performed and he was noted to have a non-occlusive basilic vein in the LUE, and occlusive thrombus of the left cephalic vein.
