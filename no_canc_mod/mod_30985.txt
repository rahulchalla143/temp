No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D  or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear  structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of  [**2169-5-5**], no change.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Linear opacities in both lower lobes which may represent scarring or residua of prior infection  CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Short P-R interval.
Since the previous tracing of [**2169-3-8**] T wave abnormalities are probably more marked but baseline artifact precludes some compoarison in the lateral precordial leads.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 yo woman with ho of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], HTN, spinal compression fractures treated  with narcotics, presented with symptoms of narcotic withdrawal including chills, diarrhea, dehydration and hypokalemia with possible exacerbation of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
History of previous narcotic withdrawal after discontinuation of narcotics.
Right proximal UE weakness and left LE proximal weakness.
Mild lid lag with adduction of left eye after 30 sec upward gaze, no diplopia or ptosis.
Progress:  Neurology: Neurological examination was closely monitored as symptoms of narcotic withdrawal resolved.
With increasing symptoms of shortness of breath, and exclusion of other cardiorespirtory causes, there was concern for exaccerbation of MG.
Strength was full with minimal fatiguability at time of discharge.
Respiratory: Increasing shortness of breath was associated with carbon dioxide retention (arterial CO2 50).
There was no evidence of heart failure or pneumonia on CXR.
Risk factors for anaemia screened for in order to address treatable causes which may be contributing to shortness of breath.
Iron studies showed elevated ferritin.
Further decreases could be made in standing doses slowly if pain remains well controlled.
Oxycodone 10 mg tid prn pain 4.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] Chronic back pain due to compression fractures post steroid use Narcotic withdrawal   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Back pain controlled, power full and breathing at baseline with establishment of BiPAP.
Ensure supply of medications to avoid withdrawal symptoms in the future.
Seek medical advice for any symptoms of worsening weakness or shortness of breath or other concerns.
