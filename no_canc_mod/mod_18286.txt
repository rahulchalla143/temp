Admission Date:  [**2153-8-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-9-26**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Fluoxetine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: Large R PICA stroke.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Suboccipital craniotomy tracheostomy PEG tube placement Placement and removal of central line   History of Present Illness: 83F h/o DM, CAD p/w n/v & lethargy, found to have large R PICA stroke at [**Hospital 6138**] Hospital.
USOH until today when she complained of nausea and vomiting, with generalized weakness.
She presented to OSH and CT showed R PICA stroke.
She became increasingly lethargic and was intubated for airway protection.
83 yo f with PMH positive for CAD, strokes, NIDDM, Asthma presented to OSH with lethargy and cc of weakness, n/v on [**2153-8-21**].
Was found to have right cerebellar stroke and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
At [**Hospital1 **] ED she was intubated for airway protection due to increased lethargy and put on neosynephrine drip due to hypotension.
Review of Head CT showed large right PICA cerebellar infarct with midline shift and pressure on the 4th ventricle.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Toes up on left, down on right   Pertinent Results: CT from OSH (images reviewed): Large R cerebellar infarct with some mass effect on midline of cerebellum, enlarged 3rd ventricle, mass effect on 4th ventricle but not fully compressed.
No hemorrhage.
Old L PCA infarct.
Multiple small cortical infarcts.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Hypodensity consistent with edema and infarction involving most of the right and possible a small part of the left cerebellar hemisphere, producing mass effect with almost complete effacement of the fourth ventricle.
Hypodensity in the watershed zones bilaterally may represent chronic infarcts.
Small hypodensities in the periventricular and deep white matter, likely representing sequela of chronic microvascular ischemia.
Acute right posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarct with blood products.
Post-surgical changes are seen in the region.
Chronic right and left cerebellar infarct.
Chronic cortical infarcts in the left frontoparietal region.
Severe changes of small vessel disease and moderate brain atrophy.
Small incidental calcified meningioma right temporal region  Head CT [**8-23**]: -new cerebellar bleed  Brief Hospital Course: # Strokes/Mental Status: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with a large cerebellar stroke with evidence of compression of her fourth ventricle and hydrocephalus of the 3rd ventricle.
She was given a 6-pack of platelets (as she had been on aspirin and Plavix) and was taken emergently from the ED to the OR by neurosurgery where she underwent a suboccipital craniotomy for decompression.
A TTE showed a large PFO with an Atrial septal aneurysm therefore her mechanism was felt to be likely thromboembolic.
Mentation greatly improved during the patient's stay, correlating with treatment of her pneumonia and tracheostomy placement.
She would deny pain or discomfort.
# Respiratory Distress: Patient received tracheostomy on [**2152-11-30**], and her chest x-ray has demonstrated much improvement, only notable for persistent lll collapse.
Patient was treated for ventilator associated pneumonia twice with courses vancomycin and zosyn.
Ultrasound was used to evaluate for potential effusion for thoracentesis, but there was not enough fluid to tap.
Patient was unable to be weaned off of the ventilator, and failed trials of extubation, aggressive pulmonary toilet, and had repeated atelectatic collapse of of lung.
Given her repeated collapse noted on chest x-ray and on repeat bronchoscopies, patient may be candidate for stent placement from interventional pulmonology in the future.
A few days before discharge, she had a sputum sample taken that grew pan-sensitive klebsiela.
If her clinical condition were to change, would consider covering klebsiela with antibiotics.
# Clonus: Patient was noted to have a new finding of bilateral cloni of the feet on exam, and mild serotonin syndrome was suspected.
A repeat head CT shows no new bleeding or lesions, but increased size of pseudomeningocele.
# Fever: Patient continued to have low grade fevers and leukopenia, however no systemic signs of infection were noted, and cultures remained negative.
If her clinical picture should change, as noted above in respiratory section, she should be covered for the klebsiela found in her sputum.
# Blood pressure: Patient had highly variable blood pressure while in the intensive care unit.
She was initially hypertensive, and then became hypotensive, which was typically responsive to fluids.
#Metabolic Alkalosis:  Patient noted to have small metabolic alkalosis, pH 7.44 HCO3 36 at the time of discharge.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# CAD: Stable.
She was not restarted on ASA and plavix at the time of discharge because of bleeding risk.
Her primary care physician will need to follow up these medications in the future and reevaluate risks and benifits of these medications.
# Aortic stenosis: Patient has history of aortic stenosis, therefore we were cautious with afterload reduction .
# DM  blood sugars at goal at this time on NPH 13 units in AM and PM.
# FEN: Continue tubefeeds .
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain / fever.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): hold for diarrhea or >1BM per day.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation: hold for diarrhea or >1 BM per day.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 5503**] Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Stroke Ventilator Associated Pneumonia Diabetes COPD   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Patient was seen in the hospital for a stroke.
The course was complicated by ventilator associated pneumonia and a difficult extubation course.
Either return to the emergency room or call your primary care physician if the patient develops any difficulty breathing, increasing oxygen requirement, any change in mental status or new neurological deficits, or with any concerning symptoms.
