was able to name both high and low frequency objects.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages on the right, unable to visualize on the left III, IV, VI: EOMI without obvious nystagmus, although poorly cooperative.
-Motor: Increased tone bilaterally in lower extremities.
No pronator drift bilaterally.
No asterixis noted.
-Coordination: Mild intention tremor bilaterally.
Slowed rapid alternating movement on the left.
No dysmetria on FNF, unable to perform in lower extremities  -Gait: Deferred   Pertinent Results: CT Head (report): Impression: 2 x 2.5 cm hyperattenuating lesion in the inferior half of the left cerebellar hemisphere, consistent with an acute or subacute cerebellar hemorrhage, surrounded by a zone of edema.
There is minimal displacement of the medulla to the right, about 1.5mm.
There is no dilatation of the lateral, third or fourth ventricles.

Mil mass effect on the vermis and inferior 4th ventricle.
MR may be helpful to evaluate for underlying mass lesion, vascular malformation, or amyloid angiopathy or underlying mass.
CT head [**2147-2-17**]  FINDINGS: Previously described left cerebellar hemorrhage is unchanged in size measuring 2.3 x 1.8 cm with unchanged mild surrounding edema and mild mass effect on the vermis and inferior fourth ventricle.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
There is no evidence of midline shift or herniation.
No new sites of hemorrhage are identified.
Unchanged periventricular small vessel disease.
No evidence of infarction.
Unchanged arachnoid cyst anterior to the left frontal lobe and unchanged well-defined benign appearing 17 mm lesion in the left parietal bone ([**1-21**]), likely representing an epidermoid.
Compared to the most recent prior CT from [**2147-2-15**], there is unchanged size and density of the left cerebellar hemorrhage with mild mass effect on the vermis and inferior fourth ventricle.
No evidence of hydrocephalus or new sites of hemorrhage.
MRI of the brain might be considered for evaluation of underlying masses, vascular malformation, or amyloid angiopathy.
Discharge Labs:  138 | 102 | 14 ---------------< 96 3.9 |  31 | 0.7         12.4 6.0 >--------< 268        36.6  Brief Hospital Course: The pt is an 88 year-old right handed woman with a history of dementia being transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] after being admitted for altered mental status, and found on CT to have a 2x2 cm left cerebellar hemorrhage.
She was hypertensive to the 160s-170s at the OSH with some degree of agitation, thus hypertensive hemorrhage is a possibility.
Amyloid angiopathy, cavernous angioma, and underlying mass were also in the differential diagnosis.
It is suspected that her hemorrhage was secondary to hypertension and/or a component of amyloid angiopathy.
ID: The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection prior to arrival.
No behavioral disruption was noted, and we would recommend that she remain off of these medications for the time being.
It is suspected that her initial altered mental status was likely due to the urinary tract infection.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 6598**] Manor Extended Care Facility - [**Location (un) 6598**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Cerebellar hemorrhage Secondary: Hypertension Urinary tract infection  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes, oriented to self and hospital but not date Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane) Resting tremor with cogwheel rigidity.
It was suspected that this was related to high blood pressure.
