A CT scan of the abdomen was done and was positive for portal venous gas within the liver and pneumatosis within loops of ileum in the right hemipelvis.
Findings were worrisome for ischemic bowel.
A repeat CT scan one day later was not able to confirm the finding but showed interval development of extensive thickening of the bowel wall of the ileum.
She was thought to have ischemic bowel from profound hypovolemia due to DKA.
Later on admission day pt was noted to be in respiratory distress and was intubated.
The pt was also noted to have a drop in her hematocrit of 10 points on the [**7-3**].
She was found to be guaiac positive but never had any gross GI bleed.
The hematorcit was attributed to slow grade GI bleed as well as hemodilution.
No hemolysis labs were send.
On the [**7-4**] the pt was also noted to have decreased platelet counts, coming down from 395 on admission to 132.

44 yo with possible type one diabetes, presenting in DKA with pneumatosis coli/ileal thickening in the setting of severe dehydration, anemia, and HIT-II with positive abx on argatroban.
# HIT: antibody positive, makes HIT II more likely although platelets never lower than 90 000.
Pt with increased risk of thrombosis due to hypercoagulable status.
No evidence of thrombosis was found.
Initial drop attributed to hemodilution in the setting of preexisting  anemia and low grade GI bleed as guaiac postive.
Hemolysis labs negative.
Also low Vit B12 - possible related to bowel disease as resorption in the Ileum vs pernicious anemia.
Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies should be check as an outpatient, also TTG to rule out celiac sprue should be considered.
# Diabetes:  Presented in DKA and body habitus more suspicious for type I.
It is unusual in that the patient had some mildly elevated sugars over the past year or two and did not present with frank DKA until now.
# Ileal thickening: most likely ischemic bowel in the setting of DKA and profound hypovolemia.
Predominance in the Ileum would be suspicious for Crohns disease or Yersinia.
Stool cultures negative for Cdiff and Yersinia.
Initially with leukocytosis and improvement with fluids and antibiotics therefore more likely hypovolemia and/or infectious cause.
Leukocytosis also seen in DKA and severe stress reaction.
Chronic low grade Crohns disease affecting the ileum could be considered also given Vit B12 deficiency.
Pain and diarrhea now resolved.
# Peripheral edema: resolving  Medications on Admission: none .
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
