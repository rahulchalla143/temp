Admission Date:  [**2124-12-21**]     Discharge Date:  [**2124-12-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2078-6-17**]     Sex:  F   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46-year-old woman with a history of deep venous thrombosis times two, not on anticoagulation, who also has a significant family history for coronary artery disease.
She was in her usual state of health until 10 p.m. on the night prior to admission when she developed the acute onset of infrascapular pressure at rest.
some numbness and tingling in both hands and diaphoresis and dizziness upon rising.
In the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital Emergency Department, the patient was found to have 1-mm ST elevations in lead III along with ST depressions in I and aVL.
She was given sublingual nitroglycerin, started on heparin and Integrilin drip and made pain free in the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital Emergency Department.
En route, the patient had the onset of chest pain and was known to have a possible ST elevations in right-sided V4 leads.
In the cardiac catheterization laboratory here at [**Hospital1 346**], the patient was found to have a cardiac output of 7.42, a cardiac index of 3.93, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 17, and a proximally occluded right coronary artery.
The right coronary artery lesion was stented, but her course was complicated by temporary complete heart block after a ballooning of the lesion with associated hypotension.
Pulmonary embolism times one.
Deep venous thrombosis times one.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 47.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient reports six months of postprandial epigastric pain with a sour taste rising in her throat that has not been relieved by a proton pump inhibitor.
She also notes several weeks of weakness in both hands; worse upon awakening.
At baseline, the patient reports getting short of breath when climbing one flight of stairs and occasional left ankle swelling.
She denies any orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or palpitations.
She was nauseous but in no acute distress.
The oropharynx was moist with specks of blood of in the mouth; but otherwise clear.
Jugular venous distention was roughly 8 cm to 9 cm.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, normal first heart sound and second heart sound, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The lungs revealed decreased breath sounds at the right lower lobe; but otherwise clear to auscultation.
Extremities revealed she had a right groin site without a hematoma with the sheath still in.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   The initial electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed a normal sinus rhythm at 75, normal axis, normal intervals, 0.5-mm asymmetric ST depressions in aVL and I and 1-mm ST elevations in III.
She had Q waves in II, III, and aVF with flipped T waves in III and aVF; and she had resolution of the ST elevations in III and the ST depressions in I and aVL.
She had a chest x-ray here at [**Hospital1 188**] which showed a heart size at the upper limit of normal, bilateral interstitial opacities consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  As previously mentioned, the patient had a likely inferior myocardial infarction with possible right ventricular involvement.
She was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where a proximal right coronary artery lesion had a stent placed and was subsequently treated with Integrilin, heparin, aspirin, and Plavix.
She did well and was pain free throughout the duration of her hospital stay with the exception of the day following catheterization when she experienced mild infrascapular back pain lasting 20 minutes which spontaneously resolved without any change in her electrocardiogram.
She did have some persistent nausea and some vomiting for the 24 hours status post catheterization which was treated successfully with Zofran.
From a rhythm standpoint, she remained in a normal sinus rhythm throughout the duration of her hospital stay with occasional premature ventricular contractions.
For her coronary artery disease; as previously mentioned, she had right coronary artery lesion that was stented.
ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient had some mildly elevated blood sugars of slightly greater than 120 during her hospital stay.
On discharge, she should follow up with this with her primary care physician to ensure she does not have diabetes which is contributing to her coronary artery disease.
Coronary artery disease; right coronary artery stenosis, status post stent placement, and inferior myocardial infarction (with a peak creatine kinase of roughly 1100).
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
