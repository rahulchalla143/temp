The patient has long been awaiting repair of a large inguinal hernia and ventral hernia and had stopped taking his coumadin 10 days prior to presentation (he is on this for atrial fibrillation) in order to get these procedures completed.
Over the week prior to presentation he had also noted worsening left lower extremity edema and increasing abdominal girth with worsening of his preexisting vental hernia.
Other review of systems notable for some nonproductive cough as well as general fatigue and decreased mobility for the past month, which he largely attributed to his impressive hydrocele.
At the outside hospital initial evaluation revealed abdominal wall erythema concerning for cellulitis as well as a swollen left lower extremity.
On arrival he complained of fatigue and discomfort from his large hernias.
No other issues.
He reports significant asbestos exposure over a period of several years.
He denies TOB or drug use and says he drinks alcohol only very occasionally.

The presence of an increasing pleural effusion with calcified and noncalcified pleural plaques in the setting of asbestos-related disease raises the remote possibility of mesothelioma.

There is atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 78 year old male with history of paradoxical atrial fibrillation, pulmonary asbestosis, and idiopathic RP fibrosis presenting with cellulitis and increased abdominal distension found to have DVT and with progressive chylous ascites.
1)Chylous Ascites: The patient was noted to have a distended abdomen on presentation and imaging revealed a large amount of ascites.
As the patient had not had a previous history of ascites this was worked up with liver ultrasound that revealed no parenchymal or vascular dysfunction.
Diagnostic paracentesis was obtained on [**2196-11-5**] that showed chylous ascites.
This paracentesis also revealed >250 neutrophils so the patient was empirically started on a five day course of ceftriaxone though he remained afebrile and had no abdominal pain.
After the chylous ascites was discovered primary concern was for a malignancy given the lack of liver disease.
Therefore, most likely etiology of the development of chylous ascites was thought to be progressive lymphatic obstruction from RP fibrosis leading to increased hydrostatic pressure and leak into the peritoneal cavity.
The patient had three therapeutic paracentesis on [**11-14**], and [**11-29**] respectively removing 900 cc, 3L and 1 L of chylous fluid respectively.
Unfortunately, the patient developed secondary chylothorax from fluid tracking up into the pleural space causing respiratory distress.
Attempts were made to slow accumulation of fluid with medical therapies including octreotide and low fat diet then low fat TPN but these were unsuccessful.
General surgery was consulted twice and both times said that surgery to attempt to improve lymph drainage would be unsuccessful as structures are very small and diffuse and post-surgical scarring would likely be as damaging as initial insult.
Case was discussed with thoracic surgery who thought that without clear damage to thoracic duct there was no indication for procedural management.
Finally, the possibility of lymphangiogram was discussed extensively with a possible intervention and balloon dilation of cisterna chyli.
Unfortunately, planning MRI would have been required and given patient's progressively poor respiratory status this would have required intubation.
As lymphangiogram and balloon dilation are extremely uncommon procedures, odds of success were not considered high and risk of intubation and likely difficulty extubation was discussed with the family and patient and they elected to pursue comfort focused care.
2) Chylothorax/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially noted to be hypoxic soon after admission with desats to the low 90's on room air.
He was seen by pulmonary who attributed this to ascites and his large abdomen causing restrictive pathology in the setting of his underlying pulmonary asbestosis and plaques.
This was supported by his initial PFT's that showed a restrictive pattern.
The patient then became progressively more hypoxic in the setting of an expanding right sided pleural effusion and a large amount of compressive atelectasis.
He was desatting to the low 90's on 4L O2 by nasal cannula when he had his first thoracentesis on [**2196-11-10**] with considerable improvement after the procedure.
Over the ensuing days the patient continued to put out greater than one liter of chylous fluid per 24 hour period despite the various interventions meant to reduce chylous ascites mentioned (low fat diets, octreotide, etc...).
On [**2196-11-29**] a pleurodesis was attempted in hopes of allowing eventual removal of the chest tube though interventional pulmonology thought this had a very low probability of being successful.
On [**11-26**] he desaturated to the 80's on 6L in the context of worsening infiltrates bilaterally but this seemed to improve with holding TPN and was ultimately thought most likely due to volume overload.
Despite TPN his protein and albumin continued to fall presumably due to losses in the chest tube.
After he became quite volume overloaded on [**2196-11-27**] and given the minimal reduction in fluid output seen even with the TPN modifications TPN was stopped as of [**11-27**] and he was allowed to eat for comfort.
He and his family understand he will ultimately continue to become malnourished and weaker but given poor toleration of TPN and comfort focused care this was considered acceptable by them.
4) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient was noted to have intermittently elevated white counts and on [**2196-11-19**] had a right upper lobe infiltrate on chest radiograph and had purulent sputum.
Anticoagulation with medications other than unfractionated heparin (enoxaparin, warfarin) was not optimal given his renal failure and poor nutritional status.
6)Cellulitis: The patient initially received a dose of penicillin then a few days of cefazolin with minimal improvement in his abdominal rash.
He then received 10 days of vancomycin as well as steroid cream after dermatology thought the abdominal rash could be a contact dermatitis.
This led to resolution of his abdominal rash.
7) Likely drug rash: Later in his hospitalization (around [**11-19**]-15th) he developed a morbilliform eruption on his trunk in the context of receiving a dose of piperacillin-tazobactam in the ICU.
8) Hypotension: The patient developed relative hypotension in the hospital.
This was thought likely due to poor cardiac return due to massive third spacing from his protein losses and perhaps external compression of the IVC by his abdomen.
9) Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline Cr is unclear.
At presentation Cr was 2 then trended down to 1.5 before trending up again in the setting of worsening ascites and his general deterioration.
Renal was consulted twice and ultimately concluded this was likely due to poor preload and forward flow from the heart in the context of his third spacing and massive abdominal distension.
He never became oliguric or anuric.
10) Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response while his nodal agents were being held.
11) Goals of Care: After extensive discussion with the family and patient about the lack of options for reversing the patient's chylous ascites accumulation and subsequent respiratory compromise and progressive protein wasting they elected to pursue comfort focused care.
antibiotics, pleurodesis through a preexisting chest tube) were pursued but other aggressive cares were not.
