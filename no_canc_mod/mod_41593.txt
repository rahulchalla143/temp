CTA shows occlusion of proximal L MCA with large perfusion deficit in L MCA territory on CTP.
Two small foci of slow diffusion in the left frontal and parietal regions as described above, likely represent acute infarcts.
Volume loss with chronic blood products in the left basal ganglia may represent a sequela of prior hemorrhage or infarction.
Small vessel ischemic disease.
Few scattered foci of abnormal susceptibility in bilateral cerebral hemispheres may represent microhemorrhages or cavernomas.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 10940**] is a 64 yo woman with history of DM, HTN, and a prior stroke 20 years ago (unclear characterization, no residual symptoms) who presented with acute onset aphasia and R sided weakness, consistent with L MCA syndrome.
She presented within 1 hour of symptom onset and was given IV TPA within 1.5hrs at 21:11.
Her neurological symptoms resolved with the exception of slight R NLF flattening.
By the morning of [**6-17**] her exam had markedly improved and she was essentially back to baseline except for mild R NLF flattening.
MRI showed two small infarcts in the left frontal and parietal lobes.
TTE showed no abnormalities.
On HD3, the patient went into atrial fibrillation for approximately 30 minutes.
Given that the likely source of her stroke had been identified, the patient's home atenolol was changed to metoprolol, and she was started on pradaxa.
Her simvastatin was changed to atorvastatin given her elevated LDL.
Heme: She had no clinical signs of bleeding post-tPA.
ID: She remained afebrile with no signs of infection during her ICU stay.

Neurologic: No deficits   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 10940**], You were hospitalized due to symptoms of inability to speak and weakness resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition in which a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek medical attention.
