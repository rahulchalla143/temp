Admission Date:  [**2120-8-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2120-8-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2053-8-4**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Medicine, [**Hospital1 **] Firm  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure who transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit where the patient was since [**8-6**] following an incident of hypotension (probably due to sepsis) and collapsed in the Emergency Department where the patient needed to be intubated.
The patient originally came to the Emergency Department overnight on [**8-5**] with 24 hours of abdominal pain and shortness of breath.
In the Emergency Department, the patient collapsed in the bathroom, was intubated, and was noted to have fevers as well as shortness of breath, and was noted to have a systolic blood pressure in the 60s.
First CT scan done without contrast showed concern for bowel ischemia of the semicolon as well as mild hydronephrosis of the left kidney, and a right kidney stone.
Abdominal pain and right upper quadrant pain persisted, but the patient was extubated on [**8-6**] and then weaned off oxygen over the next 24 hours.
The patient had an electrocardiogram that was done earlier in the Emergency Department which showed ST-T wave depressions in the lateral leads, but the patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction per cardiac enzymes.
Also, there was concern for aortic dissection since the patient complained of right upper quadrant radiating to the back, but the CT scan results were negative for aortic dissection.
Again, the patient was extubated on [**8-6**]; and during her time in the Medical Intensive Care Unit was stabilized with no complications and was transferred to the Medicine Service on [**8-7**].
Before transfer, it was noted that there was a first set of stool cultures drawn that were negative for Clostridium difficile.
Coronary artery disease.
Diabetes mellitus.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
In general, the patient was obese, lying in bed, in no acute distress, cooperative.
No jugular venous distention.
No hepatojugular reflux.
Chest examination revealed decreased breath sounds diffusely, but more decreased at the bases.
Right basilar crackles.
A crescendo-decrescendo 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border radiating to the clavicle.
Abdomen was soft and nontender, slightly distended, bowel sounds were present but hypoactive, tympanitic.
No guarding or rebound.
No peritoneal signs were noted.
Extremities revealed trace edema bilaterally up to the ankles.
No cyanosis, and no edema.
PULMONARY:   The patient has no history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of sleep apnea.
Therefore, pulmonary problems (her shortness of breath) was most likely related to congestive heart failure complications.
In the meantime, incentive spirometry was provided at the bedside, daily weights were checked, ins-and-outs were started, and oxygen saturations were monitored, as well as clinical symptoms of shortness of breath.
The patient's stool cultures were also negative for evidence of Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter.
Urine cultures showed a result of 7000 organisms per milliliter which was noted to most likely be due to asymptomatic bacteruria.
The patient was afebrile for the rest of the hospital stay.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was continued on gentle hydration per intravenous fluids for her recent diarrhea which was discontinued on the night prior to discharge.
The patient's symptoms were most likely due to an acute infectious etiology.
ANEMIA:  The patient had a hematocrit drop from 38.8 to 34.3 upon transfer, though it was stabilized on the day of discharge from a value of 34.1; therefore, the acute drop in hematocrit was most likely secondary to hemodilution due to aggressive intravenous fluid hydration in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was not to drink any milk, as the patient may have a question of lactose intolerance which may have caused abdominal problems.
