Please refer to operative note for complete details.
A liver ultrasound revealed patent hepatic vasculature.
On POD2 she was able to be extubated and a kidney transplant U/S showed very minimal peritransplant fluid, otherwise unremarkable appearance of transplant kidney.
She started having loose and frequent bowel movements.
Due to her poor kidney function, a kidney biopsy was performed on [**2122-1-27**], showing no evidence of acute cellular or humoral rejection.
This was most likely due to acute tubular necrosis added to a considerable chronic donor disease.
A post-biopsy hematoma was found posterior to the right lower quadrant renal transplant.
Ophthalmology ruled out any eye involvement, and decision was made to place a PICC line for Micafungin iv x 2 weeks.
On POD13 her insulin requirement increased requiring an insulin gtt, and [**Last Name (un) **] consult.
No new biopsy was felt to be necessary.
She worked progressively with physical therapy and occupational therapy, walking with walker and TLSO brace for her back problems.
