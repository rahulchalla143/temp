Presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax   [**2134-3-12**]:  Chest x-ray:  There is no change in cardiomegaly, left lower lobe consolidation and interstitial pulmonary edema.
Bilateral atelectasis and pleural effusion are most likely present, unchanged.
However, there is still evidence of moderate cardiomegaly with a mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion and subsequent left retrocardiac atelectasis.
At the bases of the right lung, a plate-like atelectasis is seen.
No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
No pulmonary embolism.
Bibasilar atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Extensive peripancreatic fat stranding with a small-to-moderate degree of mesenteric and para-renal fluid, but no well-defined fluid collections.
No pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst, or vascular compromise.
Biliary stent without biliary ductal dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 year old female admitted to the Acute care service with abdominal pain, jaundice, nausea and vomitting.
Upon admission to the emergency room,  she was hypotensive, and confused requiring intravenous fluids.
She was reported to have an impacted stone in the bile duct and underwent removal of the stone with placment of a stent.
Overnight, she was monitored in the intensive care unit requiring additional intravenous fluids for decreased urine output.
Her liver function tests slowly improved and the intensity of her pain diminished.
Her foley catheter was discontinued at this time and she was voiding without difficulty.
During this time, she did have bouts of confusion which were thought to be related to the narcotics for analgesic management.
She did have a mild elevation of her INR to 2.7 during her hospitalization, but his decreased to 1.6 over the last few days.
On HD #7, she had an episode of decreased oxygenation.
She continued to have bouts of oxygen desaturation and was taken for a chest cat scan after placment of a PICC line for intravenous access.
The cat scan was negative for a pulmonary embolism but did show bibasilar atelectasis and small bilater pleural effusions.
She is tolerating a regular diet and voiding without difficulty.
She is requiring minimal analgesia for management of her abdominal pain.
