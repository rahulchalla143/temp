Admission Date: [**2177-12-24**]        Discharge Date: [**2178-1-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-6-17**]        Sex:  M  Service:   PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of hematoma on [**2177-12-26**] and orthotopic hepatic transplant on [**2177-12-24**].
DETAILS OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 56103**] is a 49-year-old male with end-stage liver secondary to hepatitis C cirrhosis, who presented on [**2177-12-24**] for a cadaveric liver transplantation.
On postoperative day 2, he developed mild transient elevation in his liver function tests.
An ultrasound demonstrated poor hepatic flow in the liver.
Mr. [**Known lastname 56104**] deceased donor liver procurement was complicated by the development of procurement injury to the left hepatic artery such that it was absent and also a hilar injury to the right hepatic artery.
A subsequent angio was performed on [**12-25**], which demonstrated very poor flow to the liver and a very tight stenosis in the vicinity of the anastomosis.
On [**12-27**], he underwent a Doppler ultrasound of the liver demonstrating normal wave forms to the hepatic artery and again, no left hepatic arterial flow was visualized.
His liver function tests came back to normal and on postoperative day 4 after his second procedure while in the intensive care unit, he arose from a chair and while moving to the bed, became significantly hypoxic and hypotensive.
He underwent a CTPA which did not demonstrate any evidence of a pulmonary embolus.
[**Known firstname **] subsequently developed a significant status epilepticus with multiple tonic-clonic seizure disorder/seizure activity.
Over the course of the next several days, we were able to control his seizures and wean him from the breathing machine.
Upon extubation, [**Known firstname **] was noted to have significant rigidity and myoclonus of upper and lower extremities.
He did have a rise in his liver function tests on [**2178-1-5**] prompting a follow-up ultrasound which demonstrated no hepatic arterial flow to the liver.
