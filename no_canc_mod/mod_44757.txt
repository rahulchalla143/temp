He was evaluated by Gen Surgery in the ED, who felt the hernia was stable, and not related to current complaints.
Pt states that the pain is severe, [**10-7**].
There is pain localized L hip region, which starts L anterior pelvis at midline, and wraps around pelvis to posterior L spine.
Pain worse with leg movement.
Pt also notes history of bilateral leg pain, which starts at hips and radiates downt to feet B; does not have currently, and pt unable to describe if similar pain to hip pain, or if similar onset.
Pt does note that the leg pain improves when leaning over a shopping cart.
Pt is unclear if the hip pain improves with this as well, as he has been unable to ambulate.
[**12-2**], called complaining of shortness of breath as well as ?
rib vs chest pain.
[**11-29**], called about chalky feeling in throat and difficulty walking as well as cold extremities; was advised to suck on candy and push fluids.
The PCP noted that the pain might be due to decreased exercise and recommended that patient start to exercise more.
Pt also notes significant SOB, DOE, 3 pillow orthopnea (same as prior), and increased weight gain recently.

-cerebellar: No nystagmus, dysarthria, intention or action tremor, dysdiadochokinesia noted.
No acute fx or malalignment of the L spine.
A small pocket of air in the retroperitoneal space next to the spine at T11 (image 4:1), incompletely imaged and of uncertain etiology.
RADIOLOGY ATTENDING ADDENDUM There is some degree of spinal stenosis at L4-5.
The severity is difficult to evaluate due to overlying artifacts, but it is potentially severe.
There is a small collection of gas in the spinal canal on the right, just below the L4-5 interspace.
There is bulging of the disk at L5-S1 without evidence of a protrusion.
Large L inguinal hernia, with a loop of bowel in the sac.
No evidence of obstruction.
2. bony pelvis noted with DJD, but no acute fx.
Hip and L-spine X RAY [**2103-12-2**]: No acute fracture or dislocation.
Please refer to the concurrent  CT pelvis for additional findings of a large left inguinal hernia.
There is mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is septal flattening in systole which is consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation present.
Estimated PA systolic pressure, calculated from peak TR velocity,  is 53 mmHg above RA pressure.
However, with retrospective review of the prior study (which has even more limited imaging of the rightheart than the present study), there is probably some early and mild abnormalities of the right heart.
[**2103-12-10**] ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Atrial fibrillation making evaluation of ventricular function challenging.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional left ventricular systolic function.
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with evidence of volume overload.
CHEST X RAY PA/LAT [**2103-12-3**]: Findings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema and small left  pleural effusion in the setting of cardiomegaly.
Bibasilar atelectasis persists with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with low lung volumes.
Some left pleural effusion may well be present.
However, no definite pulmonary edema is appreciated.
Of incidental note is an azygos fissure, of no clinical significance.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 y/o male who presented with atraumatic left hip, left low back, and occassional bilateral lower extremity pain worse with standing and without neurological symptoms likely due to spinal stenosis who was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia.
Hypoxia / acute on chronic diastolic CHF:  Patient presented with a new oxygen requirement, satting 94% on 3L NC with bilateral rales on exam and a reported 10 lb weight gain over his dry weight with concern for pulmonary edema.
CXR revealed moderate pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion in the setting of cardiomegaly, BNP was > 3000.
He ruled out for an MI, his repeat echocardiogram revealed a normal EF and mild LVH.
The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia related to worsening pulmonary edema.
In addition the patient was diuresed and developed a contraction alkylosis, and he was treated with diamox to help correct this.
He was ambulating well but will get home PT, and given his admission for heart failure he was referred for tele health to help with diuretic management should he gain greater than 3 pounds above his dry weight.
His obstructive sleep apnea is likely a dominant cause in his R heart failure related to moderate pulmonary hypertension and is treated with CPAP.
Back and Leg pain: CT demonstrated mild degenerative changes in the pelvis but no fractures.
He was noted to have spinal stenosis.
Patient received Tylenol standing and Oxycodone PRN for breakthrough pain.
Pain and mobility improved.
Given the improvement in his symptoms he was treated conservatively however an MRI of the spine is indicated as an outpatient to further assess for severity of spinal stenosis.
History of Melanoma and Squamous Cell Cancer: No known current recurrence.
12. nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet Sublingual once a day as needed for chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Americare at Home Inc  Discharge Diagnosis: # Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure # Respiratory failure # metabolic alkalosis # Spinal stenosis # Obstructive sleep apnea # Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with back and leg pain due to spinal stenosis, but were found to be in significant heart failure.
