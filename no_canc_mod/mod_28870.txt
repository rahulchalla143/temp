History of Present Illness: The patient is a 25 year old female who sustained a gunshot wound to right check, exit wound R tempora-parietal area.
She was intubated in OSH, no BP initially, briefly placed on a dopa drip, after intubation she was moving her right upper extremity spontaneously to med flight and pupils were equal and reactive.
Head CT OSH showed displaced parietal bone fracture, with hyperdensity material temporal lobe along with subarachnoid blood.
HEENT: bleed coming from right parietal region where the skull fracture is, no scleral hemorrhage, C collor in place.
CVS: RRR, S1 S2 CHEST: CTA, no crepitus ABD: nT, ND, BS+ Extr; no edema , cool to touch with mild cyanosis lower extremities.

A CT of her head revealed extensive intraparenchymal and extraaxial hemorrhage in right temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes, and right cerebellum, with edema and herniation of brain through skull fractures.
There was minimal midline shift.
There were extensive fractures of right skull overlying area of brain injuryas well as base of skull fractures.
In addition, there were small bone fragments in middle cranial fossa, with no other retained foreign bodies.
A CT of her sinuses revealed multiple comminuted fractures of the facial bones and the skull base.
In the OR, she underwent a right sided hemi-craniectomy, temoral lobectomy, evacuation of epidural and subdural hematoma, and duroplasty.
Post operatively she was transferred to the ICU intubated and sedated in critical condition.
Dilantin was given for prophylaxis as a 1 gram load and then 100 mg Q 8 hours.
A CT of her head done immediately post op showed interval progression of extensive edema and mass effect associated with multilobar hemorrhagic injury of the right brain.
A repeat head CT 12 hours later showed no interval change.
On POD 1, she was noted to have purposeful movements of her left upper and lower extremities.
An ENT consult was obtained for possible closure of her defect, as she was draining CSF from her entry wound at her right maxilla.
A plastic surgery consult was then obtained for her orbital fractures and facial wound closure, but they declined to close the wound due to the risk of subsequent  retrograde infection.
Her wound was then closed by the neurosurgery team on POD 2 and antibiotics were stopped.
She was arousable and followed commands on the right, but with no eye opening.
Opthamology saw her for her right eye and found no evidence of a ruptured globe or any intraoccular pathology.
Evolving hemorrhage and edema within the right cerebral hemisphere, with left mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle since the prior study of [**2117-1-21**], as well as features of early obstructive hydrocephalus involving the left lateral ventricle.
Since she is been in the bed, and not moving very much her left side, obtained on [**2117-1-29**] bilateral lower extremity and left upper extremity doppler study which showed no DVT.
Patient went Speech and swallow evaluation several times, now she can be fed at upright position under supervision with cues to swallow, pure diet, nectar thick, continue with NG for meds and hydration.
Physical theray and occupational therapy felt that she needs acute rehab placement.
