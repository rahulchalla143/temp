He  A CXR showed a R IJ in place, but no overt pulmonary edema.

Blood Culture x 2 [**2-22**]: No growth .
Urine Culture [**2-22**]: MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH FECAL CONTAMINATION.
MRSA Screen [**2-22**]: No MRSA .
A single-lead left-sided pacemaker is unchanged.Within the lungs, no focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.
No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax is present.
There is mild vascular congestion.
Chain suture is noted in the left hemithorax with volume loss suggestive of prior resection.
IMPRESSION: Central catheter in standard position without pneumothorax.
No specific son[**Name (NI) 493**] sign to suggest acute cholecystitis.
Bilateral renal cysts and mild cortical thinning.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old man with h/o dyslipidemia, hypertension, CKD, COPD, afib, bladder ca s/po cystectomy/prostectomy with urostomy, parathyroid resection, and lung nodule resection who presented to OSH with a one day of weakness transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and treatment of sepsis from suspected urinary source.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: .
# Sepsis from Urinary Source: Patient had a UA with 86 WBCs and large bacteria in setting of unusual urologic anatomy with urostomy.
He was volume resuscitated with 2L in the ED with CVPs at goal, but continued to by hypotensive and was started on both levophed and vasopressin in the MICU.
His fevers, leukocytosis (34K->7K), lactatemia, and other evidence of end organ ischemia resolved and he no longer required IV fluids to maintain his pressures.
#Acute Renal Failure on CKD, Concern for Acute Tubular Necrosis: Resolved.
The likely cause for his ARF was thought to be hypoperfusion secondary to distributive shock from sepsis causing ATN.
# CAD/Troponin Leak: Has known h/o CAD s/p stenting to the LAD and LCx in [**2126**].
Is not on anti-platelet agents (ASA/plavix) given h/o heavy bleeding.
EKG was w/o acute ischemic changes and pt was asymptomatic.
Enzyme leak was attributed to demand in setting of shock as well as retention from ARF.
Atrial Fibrillation: Patient presented in AF, but not in RVR, with supratherapeutic INR (12.7) likely in setting of recent antibiotics.
Per his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] coumadin dose had recently been changed from 2 to 1 mg in the setting of his elevated INRs.
His beta blocker and coumadin were held in the setting of his acute illness and elevated INR.
# Thrombocytopenia: In setting of elevated INR, concern for DIC- fibrinogen and FDP were sent and negative.
# Transaminitis: Likely from mild shock-liver picture from hypoperfusion.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 5283**] U/S unremarkable for structural cause.
#Oral Herpes Simplex Recurrence: Not causing many symptoms or pain.
Started during his hospitalization likely related to the severe stress of medical illness.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: .
# sCHF: Stable.
His home diuretic regimen was held during his acute illness but re-started at the time of discharge.
# COPD: Stable.
#CHF: Patient is not on an Ace inhibitor which is indicated for his systolic CHF.
#Transaminitis: Patient had mild transaminitis on discharge that was downtrending and almost within normal limits.
