No acute intracranial process.
Large subgaleal hematoma at the right parietal vertex with associated soft tissue swelling/laceration.
Note is made of moderate bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary contusion.
Small nodules are also seen in a perifissural distribution on the right (2:32).
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
There is no mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Thoracic vertebral fractures at T9-T11 with anterolisthesis of T10 and tiny retropulsed fracture fragments at T10 level.
MRI recommended to assess for cord injury or epidural hemnatoma.
Pulmonary nodules in the right lung as above.
Moderate spinal cord compression at T10-11 due to mild retropulsion of the fracture T11 vertebral body, mild anterior subluxation at T10-11, and small posterior epidural hematoma from T9 through T11.
Apparent edema in the distal spinal cord.
Posterior element fractures from T9 through T11 are better visualized on the preceding torso CT scan.
Edema suggestive of disruption of the intervertebral disc at T10-11, with disruption of the posterior longitudinal ligament at this level.
Edema in the interspinous ligaments from T8-9 throgh T11-12.
Mass effect on the bladder base, possibly due to an enlarged prostate, partially visualized and incompletely evaluated.
Rapidly increasing bibasal opacification may be atelectasis but pneumonia is qually plausible; correlate clinically.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 83880**] was evaluated in the Emergency Room and admitted to the Trauma ICU with a T10 fracture of the inferior facets with anterior subluxation and a T11 compression fracture.
His MRI showed mild cord compression and his exam showed [**5-5**] strength in both lower extremities.
He had panic attacks and anxiety post op and required sedation to maintain log roll precautions and keep him calm.
He was treated with Morphine for pain and Ativan and Haldol for anxiety and delirium.
Eventually he was extubated on [**2182-12-4**] and was able to cough and deep breath and use the incentive spirometer.
He spiked a temperature on [**2182-12-4**] to 101.6 and his Chest Xray showed a left lower lobe consolidation.
He was subsequently treated with Levaquin for presumed pneumonia and kept in the ICU for an additional day for pulmonary toilet.
His appetite began to improve and he continued pulmonary toilet with no temperature spikes.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
T11 fracture dislocation through the disk space.
T10 fracture dislocation with extension through the     facet and lamina.
T9 fracture dislocation with extension through the     lamina and up and through the right transverse process     with significant soft tissue injury.
Severe thoracic stenosis with epidural hematoma.
Pneumonia  Secondary diagnosis 1.
Hypertension 2.
Discharge Instructions:  You had an operation called posterior spinal decompression for and posterior instrumented spinal fusion.Immediately after the operation:  -	Activity: You should not lift anything greater than 10 lbs for 2 weeks.
You may have some constipation after surgery.
If the incision is draining cover it with a new sterile dressing.
If the incision starts draining at anytime after surgery, do not get the incision wet.
