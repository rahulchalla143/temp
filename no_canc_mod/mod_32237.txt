Mild difficulties in obeying commands.
But otherwise no clear cranial nerve deficits.
There was no rest, action, or postural tremor.
A small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage adjacent to the surgical defect interdigitates along left frontal sulci, which demonstrate mild cortical swelling.
A small subdural hemorrhage may be present in this location as well.
A moderate amount of expected pneumocephalus is seen.
As seen on prior MR, there is moderate dilatation of the ventricles.
A small hypodense area in the left temporal lobe ( se 2, im 6) is likely artifactual.
IMPRESSION: Status post aborted DBS with small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage, mild cortical swelling, and possibly a small subdural hematoma present adjacent to the surgical site.
[**2197-4-5**] CT Head FINDINGS: Small left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage with minimal associated sulcal effacement adjacent to craniotomy due to aborted attempt of place deep brain stimulator is stable.
Previously suspected thin left frontal subdural hematoma is more evident on current study, but measures only 2-3 mm at greatest depth (2:21).
Stable moderate amount of post-procedural pneumocephalus evident.
Minimal mucosal thickening identified within the ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: Status post aborted DBS, with stable small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage layering in the left frontal sulci with mild sulcal effacement; there is a very thin subdural hematoma at the surgical site, minimally-increased and measuring only [**2-17**] mm in maximal thickness.
