He is an 81-year-old white male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a pneumothorax, status post a bronchoscopy with multiple biopsies on [**1-9**].
He had been admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
A chest computed tomography at that time revealed new significant right upper lobe mass which was worrisome for bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
The patient had multiple small nodules in the past which have been biopsied showing macronodular pulmonary amyloid.
Computed tomography also showed a left-sided pneumothorax that was not treated at that time.
He had acute shortness of breath five minutes prior to the end of the procedure and required nebulizers.
He received albuterol times three and Atrovent times one with improvement, and a subsequent x-ray revealed a large right-sided pneumothorax.
The pneumothorax was noted and attempted conservative management with nebulizers and high-flow oxygen.
At that point, he failed conservative treatment, and a right-sided chest tube was placed for respiratory distress.
His shortness of breath was resolved.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Macronodular pulmonary amyloidosis diagnosed in [**2194-1-4**].
New pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe.
Peripheral vascular disease; status post bilateral vascular surgery.
History of atrial fibrillation.
History of an anterior neck mass.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No intravenous drug abuse.
FAMILY HISTORY:   No history of pulmonary disease.
Lungs revealed bilateral breath sounds were equal.
Poor inspiratory effort.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray on [**1-13**] at 7 a.m. showed no pneumothorax.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  Status post bronchoscopy complicated by a pneumothorax.
Again, no pneumothorax developed.
An occlusive Vaseline gauze dressing was applied with minimal air leak.
A subsequent chest x-ray revealed no reaccumulation of the pneumothorax but some subcutaneous air.
The patient was maintained on oxygen over the course of the next night without any respiratory distress or other symptoms.
A chest x-ray on the morning of discharge revealed no reaccumulation of the pneumothorax.
The preliminary pathology results on the bronchoscopy specimens revealed a resolving pneumonia and amyloid.
No evidence of bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  The patient was maintained on his Atrovent, albuterol, and Serevent without any problems.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was cardiovascularly stable throughout his hospital stay with the exception of some hypertension at the time of bronchoscopy.
