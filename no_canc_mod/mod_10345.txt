Past medical history notable for pulmonic stenosis and acoustic neuroma.
This pregnancy uncomplicated until onset of preterm labor, only 1 cm dilated with fetal heart rate decel.
Therefore, delivered by cesarean section with rupture of membranes at delivery for clear fluid.
Received blow-by O2 and then developed some apnea which required positive pressure ventilation with several breaths.
Breath sounds quite clear, symmetric, slightly hyperdynamic precordium.
Abdomen benign, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.
She has never required intervention for apnea or bradycardia of prematurity.
This did not cause any problems with her respiratory stability.
Has been hemodynamically stable with a soft murmur noted on admission which continues to persist.
Echocardiogram performed on [**1-12**] revealed mild PPS with normal arch, small ASD.
She has had no further issues with sepsis during the hospital course.
The infant has been neurologically appropriate and exam has been consistent with gestational age.
Recommended immunizations include Synagis RSV prophylaxis which should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the three following criteria: (1) born at less than 32 weeks; (2) born between 32 and 35 weeks with plans for daycare during RSV seasons, with smokers in the household or preschool sibs; (3) with chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach 6 months of age.
Before this age family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Mild respiratory distress syndrome.
Rule out sepsis with antibiotics.
Atrial septal defect, peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
