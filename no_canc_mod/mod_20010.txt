According to his son, he apparently has had several falls recently including this morning when his son found him in the bathroom with altered mental status.
The patient was taken to [**Hospital3 8834**] where a head CT revealed a large acute-on-chronic RIGHT SDH with sulcal effacement and midline shift.
Apparently his pre-sedation neurological exam revealed him to be A/Ox3 with LEFT sided upper and lower extremity weakness.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: CAD  -s/p PCI to L circ and LAD in [**2-12**]  -s/p MI [**04**] years ago  -[**9-12**]: pMIBI showed a small fixed inferior defect with slight  apical redistribution suggestive of ischemia.
-[**12-13**] Echo showed EF 20% with regional left ventricular systolic dysfuntion, HK basal septum, AK distal septum, lat wall and basal ant.

Family History: No history of CAD  Physical Exam: PE on Admission: VS:  T afebrile  HR 85  BP 122/78 RR 18 (intubated)  Sat 100% Due to acuity of presentation, the patient was not examined in the absence of sedation.
Likely old fracture of the C7 spinous process.
Mild compression fracture of the C6 vertebral body.
Linear lucency invovling the anterior aspect of the T1 spinous process, which may represent small nondisplaced fracture, vs. vascular channel.
Possible old fracture near the right T2 transverse process.
There is no evidence of significant spinal canal stenosis.
Degenerative disc disease throughout the cervical spine, most severe at the level of the C6-C7.
[**2199-11-7**] CT Head Large right subdural hematoma with mixed densities in the right frontal, temporal and parietal lobe regions.
Significant leftward shift of normally midline structures.
[**2199-11-7**] CXR Severe cardiomegaly is stable.
Diffuse interstitial abnormality, unchanged since [**9-24**], new since [**9-23**] is stable edema.
There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
Transvenous right ventricular pacer and pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in position and intact although the lateral portion of the left pectoral pacemaker along with the extreme lateral left chest wall is excluded from the study.
There is no large pleural effusion or indication of pneumothorax.
[**2199-11-8**] ECG Atrial fibrillation.
Poor R wave progression.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-9-24**] artifact is present and ventricular premature beats are absent.
[**2199-11-10**] CXR Resolving congestive heart failure.
[**2199-11-11**] EKG Atrial fibrillation.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Poor R wave progression.
Cannot rule out anterior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-11-8**] left anterior fascicular block is present and baseline artifact is no longer seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 M on supratherapeutic coumadin s/p falls taken to OR for burr hole and evacuation of right subdural hematoma.
He was placed on Cefazolin for drain coverage and dilantin x1week for seizure prophylaxis.
CT spine showed multiple old cervical fractures and cervical collar was placed.
Please call your physician or go to the emergency room if you experience fever >101.4F, pain unrelieved by medication, or pus/foul-smelling drainage coming from your incision site.
