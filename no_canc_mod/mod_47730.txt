Name:  [**Known lastname 1406**],[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 647**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7401**]          Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 17930**]  Admission Date:  [**2135-8-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-9-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-5-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Percodan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 161**] Addendum: To clarify the patient's course as originally written in the discharge summary, the patient did not have a prior history of CHF and did not have CHF during her admission.
Her chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
She did likely have some component of acute pulmonary edema that improved after lasix and fluid restriction, however, she continued to require oxygen even after lasix.
As she was also receiving antibiotics for pyelonephritis and continued to improve clinically while on the antibiotics, pneumonia could not be ruled out.
