A prominent gastric bubble is stable.
There is a small amount of bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis and otherwise the lungs are clear.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Focal area of mesenteric stranding in the upper abdomen with prominent adjacent mesenteric lymph nodes.
Left lower lobe 5-mm pulmonary nodule.
In this patient with history of previous malignancy, followup with a dedicated CT of the chest is recommended in six months.
Hyperdense right renal lesion which is otherwise not completely characterized.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
There is no ventricular septal defect.

Brief Hospital Course: 62 yo F with HTN, DM2, schizophrenia, h/o breast cancer presenting with altered mental status and hypotension.
Syncope/Hypotension: Patient initally admitted to MICU from ED with persistent hypotension.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient's blood pressure was 138/76 with a baseline tachycardia which is present as an outpatient.
DDx included hypoglycemia, medication effect (recent history of hypotension as an outpatient with decrease in blood pressure medications).
Patient also with history of syncope in the past with negative outpatient work-up in the past including TTE, autonomic testing, stress test, and EEG.
DDx also includes possible vagal episode from pain, infection was also on the differential so she was initially broadly covered with vancomycin and zosyn, especially in the setting of fat stranding and mesesnteric LAD seen on CT A/P.
Overnight she again became hypotensive, requiring placement of a CVL and arterial line.
She remained on antibiotics until her cultures were negative for 48 hours, and then remained afebrile off antibiotics.
On the medical floor, the patient remained stable with no further episodes of hypotension or syncope.
She became hypertensive and her anti-hypertensive medications were slowly added back to her medication regimen.
However, the patient's blood cultures, urine cultures, and chest x-ray did not show evidence of infection.
She did have diarrhea on the floor.
Shoulder discomfort: Patient c/o bilateral shoulder discomfort over past two months.
Joint exam/ROM was without focal findings.
DDx includes osteoarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica.
Patient possibly hypoglycemic, but actos does not usually cause hypoglycemia unless combined with insulin or  sulfonylureas.
A Right Lower Lobe pulmonary nodule should get follow-up with a chest CT in 6 months.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Hypotension, NOS  SECONDARY: Diabetes Type 2 HTN   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have a very low blood pressure in the emergency room and were given fluids to increase your blood pressure.
Your lab tests did not show any signs of an infection that may have caused the low blood pressure.
Your low blood pressure and loss of consciousness may be due to some of the medications you take that can cause low blood pressure.
