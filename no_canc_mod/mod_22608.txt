Admission Date:  [**2160-10-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-11-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**] Chief Complaint: Decreased po intake  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 62618**] is an 86 year old Russian-speaking woman with a h/o HTN, anxiety, and recurrent UTIs, who has baseline moderate dementia.
She was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 62621**] for fever, confusion and falls and found to have Pott's disease.
MRI showed L4-5 osteomyelitis and discitis.
An LP was negative for TB meningitis and a repeat MRI showed no evidence of epidural abscess.
Her TB treatment was changed to ethambutol, levofloxacin and streptomycin due to elevated lfts and then isoniazid and pyridoxine were restarted once his transaminases improved.
On the day of admission ([**10-20**]) she was transfered to the [**Hospital1 **] ED for poor PO intake and dehydration as she was noted to be eating only 5-10% of her meals.
In the ED she was afebrile with a temp of 98.6, HR 58, BP 84/P, RR 18.
Decision made by ICU team in consultation with the family to make patient DNR/DNI, no pressors, no CPAP, and no feeding tubes.
Hypertension 2.
Depression 4.
Dementia 5.
No thyromegly.
CV: Tachycardic and regular with no m/r/g Lungs: CTA bilaterally anteriorly and posteriorly Abd: soft, NT, ND active BS, no hepatosplenomegly.
ext: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
[**10-22**] Stool: Negative for clostridium difficile toxin.
[**10-22**] Urine Cx--pending [**10-22**] C-diff-negative  STUDIES: [**2160-10-20**] Head CT: No evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.
[**10-20**] CXR: No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
No hydronephrosis bilaterally.
Stable marked atrophy and cystic replacement of the left kidney.
[**10-23**] CXR: There is slight increase in diffuse pulmonary edema compared with the previous study.
There is increase in left lower lobe opacity indicating pneumonia versus atelectasis.
No pneumothorax is identified.
There is small bilateral pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 year old Russian-speaking woman with a h/o HTN, recurrent UTIs, dementia, recently discharged to rehab after workup that revealed Pott's disease, re-admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with decreased po intake, ?sepsis, hypernatremia, elevated LFTs and ARF.
After several days in the ICU the decision was made by the patient and her health care proxy to make her DNR/DNI, with no aggressive treatments such as pressors, CPAP or feeding tubes.
1) Sepsis: On admisssion to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was initially thought to have urosepsis but her urine culture failed to grow bacteria (AFB still pending) and blood cultures have been negative.
She was started on Zosyn but this was stopped 11/17 per ID reccs as there is no source.
2) Pott's Disease: Her TB meds were initially held on admission due to her elevated LFTs.
Given that NG tibe was removed prior to discharge, and HCP did not want PEG tube or other artificial means of feeding, decision made to stop medications for Pott's Disease.
Patient had no cough in the hospital and CXR was negative for cavitary lesions or nodules.
3) Elevated LFTs: These are stable from her prior hospitalization, likely from her TB medications.
Patient had recently had hepatitis serologies checked, and these were not repeated.
It was also felt that patient's elevated LFTs may have risen secondary to zosyn that the patient was briefly started on during her hospitalization.
4) Acute renal failure: Suspected to be pre-renal azotemia from hypovolemia.
5) Hypernatremia: Suspected to be secondary to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
By time of discharge, urine culture remained negative for bacterial infection.
6) Elevated troponin: She had one elevated troponin (0.15) on admission - likely consistent with sepsis and does not represent ASCVD given her negative cardiac history and normal CK and MB.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Haloperidol 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID:PRN as needed for agitation.
Hypernatremia (hypovolemic).
Chronic UTIs.
