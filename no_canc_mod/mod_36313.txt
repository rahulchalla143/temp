Admission Date:  [**2178-12-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-1-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-4-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 23753**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain & blurry vision  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 45yo woman with a history of DM type I on home lantus and sliding scale who presented with abdominal pain & blurry vision.
One day prior to admission, pt developed photophobia (TV bothering her eyes), blurry vision, sharp abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest tightness & unsteady gait.
Also, (+) polyuria, polydypsia, nausea & vomiting.
EKG showed changes that were initially concerning for STEMI and pt started on heparin gtt because of this.
Cardiology reportedly saw pt & reviewed EKG in ED and felt that pt was not having ACS and that heparin was not indicated.
Additionaly, other changes, including ST depressions 1-2mm in I, V5, V6; TWI in I, aVL, biphasic T waves in V5-V6, were all unchanged from previous EKGs.)
DM type I; A1C 8.2 in [**11-3**]; no h/o DKA, but multiple ED visits for hypoglyemia 2.
HTN 3. depression 4.
Family History: History of HTN; no DM, CAD or cancer.
There is no evidence of failure or infiltrate.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Resting EKG is notable for chronic anteroseptal Q waves and left ventricular hypertrophy with STT wave abnormalities affecting the inferior leads and V4-V6.
The additional ST segment changes seen during exercise and in recovery period are uninterpretable for ischemia in the presence of baseline abnormalities.
Heart rate response was adequate, achieving 85% of maximum predicted heart rate and a rate-pressure product of [**Numeric Identifier **].
IMPRESSION: No angina-type symptoms with uninterpretable EKG for  ischemia.
Resting hypertension exacerbated with exercise.
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium.
Brief Hospital Course: 45F with h/o type I diabetes mellitus who presents with DKA.
# DKA - DKA likely resulted from medication non-compliance.
Infectious etiologies also considered as cause of DKA although her CXR, UA, blood cultures and LP were all negative.
# Elevated cardiac enzymes: on presentation to the ED, the pt was found to have elevated CE's as well as EKG changes that were thought to be ST elevations.
Her heparin was discontinued, as she was not felt to be having Acute Coronary Syndrome.
While in the MICU, the pt had additional sets of enzymes checked.
After being called out of the MICU, the floor team consulted cardiology regarding her enzyme elevation and need for further evaluation.
The cardiology team felt that the pt had in fact had an event based on her enzymes.
# HTN - metoprolol and lisinopril were titrated for BP & HR control.
# Mental status changes - Resolved following treatment of DKA.
Likely the result of toxic-metabolic causes in setting of DKA & acidemia.
Unlikely infection given all cultures negative.
# Acute renal failure - Due to DKA and related dehydration causing prerenal azotemia.
# Depression: pt seen by social work.
# PPx - SC heparin, PPI .
