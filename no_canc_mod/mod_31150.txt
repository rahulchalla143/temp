She became tremulous and was taken to [**Company 191**] for evaluation.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service from [**Date range (1) **] with bradycardia and shortness of breath.
Her bradycardia was thought to be secondary to recent initiation of propanolol.
She was monitored in the hospital, and her bradycardia resolved.
Her SOB she was thought to be secondary to mild volume overload, for which she was diuresed with 20 mg IV furosemide.
CXR showed findings concerning for RLL infiltrate versus aspiration, widespread bilateral interstitial abnormality.

Findings concerning for right lower lung infection versus aspiration pneumonitis.
Possible mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Widespread bilateral pulmonary interstitial abnormality, chronic in appearance.
Right lower lobe consolidations have worsened.
Left lower lobe opacities have markedly increased this could be due to atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are larger on the right side.
Moderate pulmonary edema has increased.
Patient has known chronic interstitial disease.
Head CT [**8-22**]: No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute infarction.
Given the change, this would favor worsening pulmonary edema, although a diffuse pneumonia should also be considered.
Small bilateral effusions are less well visualized on the current examination.
No pneumothorax.
Unfolded calcified tortuous aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
Diffuse bilateral airspace process does not appear to be significantly changed and could reflect moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema or bilateral infectious process.
Probable small layering left effusion.
No pneumothorax.
Most likely atrial flutter with slow ventricular response.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Left atrial abnormality.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes.
Absence of ventricular ectopy as compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-8-25**].
Microbiology: [**8-21**] Blood Culture: Negative [**8-23**] Blood Culture: Negative [**8-23**] Urine Legionella: Negative [**8-24**] Urine Culture: Negative [**8-25**] Urine Culture: Negative [**8-27**] C. Diff: Negative   Brief Hospital Course: Brief Course: 83F hx IDDM, HTN, CAD s/p MI in [**2077**], seizure disorder, SLE, CKD (baseline Cr 1.2), and recent admission for bradycardia thought secondary to propanolol who is admitted for evaluation of bradycardia and hypotension.
Bradycardia was responsive to atropine and the hypotension improved as the bradycardia improved.
Patient was also found to be hyponatremic which was corrected with diuresis and hypertonic saline.
A pneumonia was identified on chest xray and treated for HCAP with cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin.
Active Issues: #Hyponatremia: Thought to be secondary to hypovolemia/poor forward flow with possible component of SIADH.
CXR with findings concerning for right lower lung infection versus aspiration pneumonitis.
She was started on HCAP coverage with vanc/cefepime for an 8 day course with addition of azithromycin for atypical coverage.
CT head ruled out acute intracranial process.
We treated her pneumonia and hyponatremia as above.
Of note, her mental status made her an increased aspiration risk so she was evaluated by speech and swallow who recommended pureed solids and nectar thick liquids.
Prior episode had been attributed to propranol, but her symptoms have persisted since her last discharge.
Patient did respond to atropine in the ED, and did not have any episodes of bradycardia in-house.
Likely has a component of conduction disease but cardiology at this point deferred pacer placement.
#Hypertension: Blood pressures persistently elevated in the 140-170s.
Patient was restarted on her home blood pressure medications when her hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **] resolved.
#Hyperkalemia:  Persistently > 5 over the 1st part of admission, likely in setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
Less likely to be from adrenal insufficiency or beta blocker toxicity, though this was considered.
#Hypoglycemia: Resolved with oral glucose.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been due to poor PO intake in setting of worsening clinical status.
Adrenal insufficiency considered but less likely given normal random cortisol.
Thought to have a component of low flow from volume overload, with low urine Na+ on admission.
Likely secondary to bone marrow suppression in the setting of her acute illness.
However, both the anemia and thrombocytopenia improved and stabilized.
Lidocaine 5% Patch 1 PTCH TD DAILY:PRN pain 10.
Lidocaine 5% Patch 1 PTCH TD UNDEFINED pain 8.
Bisacodyl 10 mg PO DAILY:PRN constipation hold for loose stools 20.
Senna 2 TAB PO BID hold for loose stools 23.
Maalox/Diphenhydramine/Lidocaine 15 mL PO BID:PRN mouth pain  27.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay Skilled Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Bradycardia Altered mental status Hospital acquired pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were also found to have a pneumonia that is being treated with antibiotics through your veins.
You became confused during your hospitalization which improved, although you are still not quite back to your baseline.
