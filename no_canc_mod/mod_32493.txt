2) Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: 82 yom with hx of ESRD on HD, HTN, DM Type II with Peripheral Neuropathy, Afib on Coumadin who presented from an OSH with SDH s/p fall.
He denies LOC, chest pain, shortness of breath, convulsions, incontinence, pre-syncope, dizziness or lightheadedness.
He had a CT head done which showed a small 5mm left parietal subdural hematoma, INR 3.1 and was given Vit K and 2u FFP.
He developed uncontrolled HTN with SBP in 180s and was given multiple doses of Hydralazine PO/IV and Metoprolol PO/IV with minimal response.
Due to his uncontrolled HTN and stable SDH, he was transferred to the MICU for further management.
He was feeling well and denied any current CP, SOB, dizzines, LH, N/V, abdominal pain, fevers or chills.
He did report numbness in bilateral feet which has been stable for many months.

He is divorced with no children.

Small, acute left parietal subdural hematoma as described above.
No overlying soft tissue or osseous injuries identified.
Diffuse dilatation of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles appear disproportionate to the degree of underlying atrophy.
Ultrasound RUE ([**2127-10-2**]): IMPRESSION: Somewhat technically limited study, but no deep vein thrombosis seen in the right arm.
Abnormal appearance of the femoral neck on one view raises the possibility for a mildly displaced fracture.
Degenerative changes of the hips bilaterally.
No evidence of acute hip fracture.
Large lucent lesion of the left femoral head with a scalloped contour suggests the possibility of a joint-based process, possibly bilateral given the slightly abnormal contour of the inferior right femoral head.
Differential possibilities would include amyloid in this patient with end- stage renal disease.
Degenerative changes of the hips bilaterally.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 82 yom w/ ESRD on HD, HTN, DM Type II with peripheral neuropathy, Afib on Coumadin who presented from OSH with SDH.
1) Subdural hematoma: Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with small, acute left parietal subdural hematoma sustained during a mechanical fall with head impact.
2) Hypotension:  On the neurosurgery service, he developed hypertensive urgency and was treated unsuccessfully with IV/PO metoprolol and IV/PO hydralazine.
A central line was placed in the setting of progressive hypotension out of concern for sepsis.
However, sepsis was unlikely given that he remained afebrile and without a white count.
Additionally, the pt underwent dialysis on the evening of [**10-3**] and upon return to the ICU developed Afib with RVR in the context of large volume removal.
Ultimately, no antibiotics were required, and hypotension resolved with fluid resuscitation.
His metoprolol was uptitrated, and diltiazam 30 TID was added due to persistent elevation of BPs.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient's blood pressure was periodically elevated in the SBPs 180s.
4) Atrial fibrillation: The patient remained in normal sinus rhthym while he was on the floor with combination therapy from rate controlling agents metoprolol and diltiazem.
On [**2127-10-5**], Diltiazem was switched Nifedipine CR given concern for over-blockade with two anti-nodal agents.
However, per his CHADS score of 3 (age, hypertension, and diabetes), the patient is at substantial risk for thrombotic complications of his atrial fibrillation.
5) ESRD:  The patient has chronic renal failure and was followed by Nephrology while he was an inpatient.
6) DM Type II:  Upon admission, the patient's glypizide was held and he was started on an insulin sliding scale.
His symptoms resolved with D50 bolus and his insulin sliding scale was halved.
7) Peripheral Neuropathy: Remained stable throughout the patient's stay in the hospital.
Because of immobility as well as the presence of the central line in the right internal jugular vein, there was concern for possible thrombosis.
A RUE ultrasound showed no thrombi and the RUE continued to have strong pulses.
9) Left Hip Pain: On [**2127-10-5**], the patient complained of worsening pain in his left hip and anterior thigh and deomonstrated increased pain with ambulation.
There was no history of trauma but there was concern for an occult fracture secondary to the patient's original fall on [**2127-9-29**].
The patient's hip was imaged with a left pelvic xray which showed degenerative changes of the hip bilaterally as well as lucency in the left femoral neck, but low suspicion of fracture.
A left pelvic CT w/o contrast was then performed which demonstrated a "Large lucent lesion of the left femoral head with a scalloped contour suggests the possibility of a joint-based process, possibly bilateral given the slightly abnormal contour of the inferior right femoral head.
Differential possibilities would include amyloid in this patient with end- stage renal disease."
Per discussion with Orthopaedic team, this is likely consistent with amyloid vs. bone cyst related to DJD.
At discharge, was referred to the Total Joint [**Hospital 9696**] Clinic for follow-up and consideration of future hip replacement.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Baypointe - [**Hospital1 1474**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Subdural hematoma Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Mechanical fall Hypotension Hypertension .
Secondary: Diabetes Mellitus Type II End stage renal disease Peripheral Neuropathy Degenerative joint disease of left hip   Discharge Condition: Ambulating with walker.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **], you have been diagnosed with a subdural hematoma, a bleed in your brain that occurred after your fall.
If your bleed is stable after reevaluation, it will be important for you to restart your Coumadin.
Additionally, you have been treated for hypertension and atrial fibrillation during your current admission to the hospital.
Your medications for hypertension and atrial fibrillation have been changed to Toprol XL 150 mg PO daily and Nifedipine CR 120 mg PO daily.
During this admission, you have also received hemodialysis for your kidney disease.
You also underwent several studies for left hip pain.
This included a left hip xray and a left hip CT scan.
There was no bone fracture detected on these studies.
