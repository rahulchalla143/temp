Equivocal right suprarenal lesion, 3,5cm, can represent complex cyst, mass or secondary to volume averaging.
CT Pelvis: IMPRESSION: No fracture.
Mild degenerative changes at the level of T8-9, without canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
Evaluation for subtle cord abnormalities on the sagittal T2 or STIR sequences is limited.
No evidence of cord compression.
Left anterior fascicular block.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
