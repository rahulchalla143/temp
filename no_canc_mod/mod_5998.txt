The patient presented to the Emergency Department where a computed tomography scan showed multiple brain lesions confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging.
The Neurology staff was consulted and felt the picture was consistent with multiple septic brain emboli, and the patient was started on ceftriaxone and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  His neurologic status deteriorated with decreased mental status and extensive posturing on the left and withdrawal on the right with equal pupils.
A repeat computed tomography scan showed a 6-cm X 5-cm right posterior frontoparietal intracranial hemorrhage with mass affect.
In view of the decreased level of consciousness, the patient was taken to the operating room for evacuation of the hematoma without intraoperative complications on [**2169-5-22**].
The patient was felt to have a question of septic emboli from endocarditis.
The pupils were 3 mm down to 2 mm and brisk bilaterally.
He showed his thumb and two fingers and wiggled his toes on the right.
On [**5-23**], the patient had a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed a bicuspid aortic valve endocarditis abscess with embolic occlusion of the left anterior descending artery.
Discussed the aortic valve root replacement with Cardiothoracic Surgery; and unless the patient was able to be heparinized and put on bypass, the surgery would become extremely risky.
The patient also had an akinetic apex, and portions of the septal and anterior wall were also akinetic with vegetation on each valve.
No eye opening.
A computed tomography showed persistent intraventricular hemorrhage with mild intraventricular effacement and increased swelling.
On [**2169-5-24**], the patient's blood cultures came back positive with gram-positive cocci in [**5-11**] bottles.
He continued to have extensor posturing in the left upper extremity to pain.
Computed tomography showed no significant change in hemorrhages.
On [**5-27**], the patient had a repeat head computed tomography which showed no significant change from the head computed tomography done on [**5-25**].
A chest x-ray showed no evidence of infiltrate.
A head computed tomography was obtained.
A computed tomography on [**6-1**] showed no significant change.
For the patient's condition, the patient had an emergent transesophageal echocardiogram for worsening blood pressure control and temperatures to 103.9.
Transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which showed an abscess of the aortic root, moderate mitral regurgitation, severe aortic regurgitation, large pericardial effusion.
