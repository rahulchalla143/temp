# UGIB - No prior history of UGIB.
Known cirrhosis s/p TIPS, ultrasound on admission showed patent TIPS but with decreased velocity.
He was seen by the liver service and underwent an urgent upper endoscopy that showed duodenal ulcers with no active bleeding, grade I esophageal varices with no stigmata of recent bleeding, and one ulcer with clot indicating likely source of recent GIB.
Pt received 3 units PRBC in MICU total, hct stable and increased appropriately with transfusion post-EGD.
# Cirrhosis - Cirrhosis felt to be secondary to ETOH abuse.
Currently with acute elevation of liver enzymes, with AST/ALT ratio > 2 and elevated bilirubin.
Acute decompensation maybe related to TIPS stenosis, ETOH hepatitis, infection.
Also with mild synthetic dysfunction.
US showed insufficient ascites for paracentesis, unlikely to be SBP.
# Acute renal failure - Likely pre-renal in setting of GIB and poor PO intake, FeUrea was 4.8%, consistent with a prerenal etiology and his creatinine improved with blood transfusions and IV fluids.
