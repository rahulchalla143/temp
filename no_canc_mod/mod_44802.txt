Stress test revealed a new anterolateral and inferolateral reversible defect with a decline in LVEF.
He was found to have coronary artery disease and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrates three vessel coronary disease.
There is an 80% lesion in the distal left main coronary artery.
The left anterior descending is involved, with ostial diagonal and ramus lesions of 70% and proximal LAD lesion of 40%.
The right coronary arteyr contains an 80% lesion in the proximal posterior descending.
There is a 50% lesion in the distal right coronary artery.
Left ICA <40% stenosis  [**2155-12-26**] Echo: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated and displays mild to moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is a suggestion of a possible fibroelastoma on the left or non-coronary cusp but it can not be definitively determined.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A left pleural effusion is noted.

He was transfused with blood products postoperatively for coagulopathy and anemia likely due to blood loss and volume resucitation.
Anticoagulation was resumed for his chronic atrial fibrillation.
He remained in CVICU until POD#3 for aggressive pulmonary hygiene.
He was slow to progress but transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
