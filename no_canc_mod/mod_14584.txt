There is a left pacer/AICD with leads extending to the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.
There is increased right pleural effusion, with associated right lower lobe volume loss.
There is increased opacity in the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure.
This may reflect layering effusion and atelectasis, though superimposed pneumonia is not excluded.
There is prominence of the right hilar structures, though this may be secondary to rotation, given lack of right hilar abnormality on recent chest CT.
The pulmonary vasculature is prominent, consistent with fluid overload.
There is no acute osseous abnormality.
Basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis versus pneumonia.
There is no echogenic intraluminal thrombus identified.
There is minimal soft tissue edema in the antecubital region.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT in the left upper extremity.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: severe diastolic left ventricular failure and secondary right ventricular failure.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-10-12**], severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension are now evident.
[**2186-5-11**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay.
Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition.
Diffuse T wave changes.
[**2095-5-10**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is slight improvement.
The extent of the bilateral pleural effusions is slightly decreased.
No evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities suggesting interval appearance of pneumonia.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
Bilateral pleural effusions persist, more prominent on the left.
Basilar atelectatic change is again seen, especially on the left.
Lung volumes have mildly decreased.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 59863**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with hx of sick sinus syndrome s/p pacer as well as recent admission for PNA, transaminitis, pancreatitis, MS changes, who presents from rehab with lethargy and was found to be hypotensive.
Baseline blood pressures are 130s-140s and patient was hypertensive at rehab.
These interventions were therefore withheld, and the patient's blood pressure improved on its own with diuresis and antibiotics.
# Hypoxia: The patient's presentation was concerning for early sepsis from presumed respiratory source vs. CHF exacerbation with volume overload (as suggested by changes on CXR), and she was admitted to the MICU.
Negative cardiac enzymes were reassuring for minimal contribution from acute cardiac ischemia.
Echocardiogram showed right heart failure and pulm htn and she received IV Lasix to promote diuresis with good effect.
# Elevated LFTs: Trending down compared to prior admission.
# Hx of Pancreatitis: Patient did not appear to have abdominal tenderness although this was difficult to assess.
Lipase was slightly elevated but trending down.
insulinoma was considered, however it was felt that low blood sugars were much more likely [**2-28**] acute illness.
# ?Hypothyroid: Pt had elevated TSH and normal FT4 on this admission.
-Pt should have recheck TSH and FT4 [**3-1**] wks post-discharge  # Mental Status Changes: Felt likely from acute medical issues and underlying dementia.
Improved with diuresis and antibiotics.
# Prophylaxis: Holding subcutaneous heparin as pt had elevated PTT while on it  # Code:  DNR/DNI, confirmed with family, pt may benefit from referral to palliative care consult as pt has many serious medical conditions  Medications on Admission: Medications per prior D/C summary from yesterday: Acetaminophen 325-650mg PO q4H PRN pain, fever Calcium Carbonate 500mg PO QID PRN indigestion Donepezil 10mg PO qHS Senna 1 tab PO BID PRN constipatin Colace 100mg PO BID Albuterol Sulfate Nebulizer q6H Toprol XL 75mg PO qday Nifedipine SR 60mg PO qday Pantoprazole 40mg PO qday   Discharge Medications: 1.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization [**Month/Day (3) **]: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Miralax 17 gram Powder in Packet [**Month/Day (2) **]: One (1)  PO once a day: hold for loose stool.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: CHF, hypotension secondary: hypoglycemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
