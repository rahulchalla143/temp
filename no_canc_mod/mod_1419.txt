Most c/w drug-mediated process   Brief Hospital Course: 34 y/o F with allergic reaction (pruritis and angioedema), acute renal failure, and acute hepatitis likely secondary to Allopurinol.
Acute Drug-Induced Hepatitis- The patient presented to clinic on [**12-1**] with intense pruritis and dyspnea.
This progressed to facial and lip swelling and increased difficulty breathing upon arrival to the ED.
She remained respiratory stable and hemodynamically stable in the MICU and did not require intubation or pressor support.
By labs, she was noted to have acute hepatitis with AST=1206 ALT=1293 Tbili=584 and Alk/Phos=2.2.
In addition, she was in acute renal failure with Cr =3.1.
Liver ultrasound was performed and demonstrated no mass or ductal disease.
By [**12-6**], hospital day#6, AST=753 and ALT=636 with conservative management.
Liver biopsy was performed and demonstrated acute and chronic inflammation, plasma cells, eoinophils and neutrophilic infiltrate.
No viral inclusions, no granulomas, no biliary disease.
Although allopurinol toxicity generally causes granulomatous hepatitis and there were no granulomas present, allopurinol was still thought to be the most likely culprit medication.
She also noticed improvement in her pruritis and much improved reduction of her facial and lip swelling.
Angioedema/Pruritis: Allergic reaction thought to be secondary to allopurinol.
On presentation, her Creatinine was elevated at 3.1.
UTI- Urinalysis on [**12-4**] showed moderate leukocytes and >50 bacteria, so she was started on a 3 day course of levofloxacin which was completed on [**2166-12-7**].
