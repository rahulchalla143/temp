Admission Date:  [**2169-7-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-8-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-3-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9662**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 52 year old female with a past medical history of asthma who presented to the ED with cough and worsening SOB x 1 day.
She states that she woke up this morning with SOB and had a fever to 101 at home.
Per her report, she had similar symptoms in [**2167**] requiring intubation for multifocal pneumonia.
She felt increasingly SOB with associated lightheadedness.
CXR showed multifocal pneumonia.

admission weight recorded as 245 kg--error in one of these weights) GENERAL - Morbid obesity.
NAD, comfortable, somewhat depressed affect HEENT - NC/AT, sclerae anicteric, MMM NECK - supple, no thyromegaly, JVP difficult to assess due to habitus HEART - RRR, nl S1-S2, no MRG LUNGS - Diffuse expiratory and inspiratory wheezes and squeaks, more significant during expiration; improved from yesterday.
ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no organomegaly appreciated EXTREMITIES - WWP, 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs), trace edema and signs of venous stasis SKIN - no rashes or lesions NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact.
IMAGING: [**2169-7-26**] CXR: Confluent consolidation is seen in the right lower and left lower lungs concerning for pneumonia.
No large effusions are seen.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Consolidation in the lower lungs, right greater than left, concerning for pneumonia.
Diffuse opacities, worse in the lower lobe are unchanged, suggesting that these abnormalities likely represent pneumonia and less likely pulmonary edema.
There are no new lung abnormalities, pneumothorax, or large pleural effusions.
[**2169-7-30**] CXR: Again seen is moderate cardiomegaly and diffuse bilateral patchy alveolar infiltrates.
Compared to the prior study, the pulmonary status is slightly worse.
[**2169-7-27**] Left leg LENI: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower extremity.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Mildly dilated aortic root and ascending aorta.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old woman with a history of morbid obesity, asthma (no PFTs in OMR), and pneumonia requiring intubation in [**2167**], who presented initially with cough, SOB, and fever to 101, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and treated for CAP, asthma exacerbation, and pulmonary edema.
# Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Patient with fever, SOB, tachypnea, and evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CXR.
She was initially treated with levofloxacin for CAP, and vancomycin was later added due to bacteremia (see below); later determined to be a contaminant.
She also had significant wheezing suggesting an asthma exacerbation, which was treated (see below).
She also had signs of volume overload and pulmonary edema, which was treated (see below).
She did have asymmetric leg swelling L>R on admission, but LENI was negative for DVT.
However, because of well-appearance, non-labored breathing, and the absence of recent healthcare contacts, her [**Name2 (NI) 621**] were re-narrowed to levofloxacin and she completed a 7 day course ([**7-27**]->[**8-2**]).
#Asthma/?COPD: The patient has a history of asthma with multiple admissions (last in [**2166**]); takes ventolin PRN, but never been on a controller medication.
No PFTs on record; given her significant smoking history, she may have COPD vs. asthma.
While on prednisone she has be famotidine 20 mg q12 hours for prophylaxis and HISS for blood sugar control.
She should follow up with outpatient PFTs to distinguish if she has asthma vs. COPD vs. another type of lung process.
#Pulmonary Edema due to Diastolic CHF: Patient has HTN and LVH and in the past has been on lasix, but on admission had no current HTN/CHF medications.
Her CXR showed bilateral fluffy infiltrates suspicious for pulmonary edema vs. ARDS.
TTE revealed moderate-severe LVH with good systolic function (EF >55%).
Likely has an element of diastolic dysfunction.
She was diuresed with IV lasix >5 L with no initially no change in pulmonary edema on CXR; however, she improved symptomatically with lasix.
#Obesity hypoventilation/?OSA: Sleep consult on [**8-2**] was done due to concerns for obesity hypoventilation and OSA.
# Bacteremia: Bcx from [**7-26**] grew out Coag NEG staph and staph epidermitis (sensitive to vancomycin), so she was started on vancomycin.
She remained afebrile wtih stable BPs throughout the admission.
She was restarted on trazodone 50-100 mg QHS due to difficulty sleeping.

You came in because of cough, fever, and shortness of breath.
You were found to have a pneumonia and were treated with antibiotics.
It seemed that you were having difficulty breathing because of asthma triggered by your pneumonia, for which you received inhaled medications and oral steroids.
Your respiratory therapy and treatments for asthma will continue at the rehab facility.
You were also seen by a sleep doctor who thinks you may have obstructive sleep apnea, which may be contributing to your shortness of breath.
