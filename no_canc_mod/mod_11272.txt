She was noted to have lethargy, decreased oxygen saturation in the low 80s.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was suctioned with increased secretions and the saturation improved on a 40% tracheostomy mask.
Prior to this presentation, the patient had had multiple complicated admissions, including from [**2190-2-27**], to [**2190-3-3**], for hepatic artery stenosis, status post dilatation and stent, complicated by acute renal failure and multiple multiresistant organisms.
The patient then was admitted from [**2190-3-12**], to [**2190-4-9**], with elevated alkaline phosphatase of unknown origin, episode of [**Year/Month/Day **]/sepsis from a urinary tract infection and pneumonia requiring a Medical Intensive Care Unit transfer, questionable dystonic reaction to Phenergan, and intermittent left bundle branch block with troponin leak, and intermittent delirium, pyloric tube placed for feeding and diarrhea.
In the Emergency Department, the patient denied chest pain, abdominal pain, fever, chills or sweats.
She complained of shortness of breath and needing suctioning.
The shortness of breath improved after suctioning.
The patient also complained of buttocks pain.
The patient was unable to give significant history but nodded and shook her head appropriately to questioning.
Hepatitis C virus, status post liver transplant in [**2189-1-31**], and redo transplant in [**2189-2-28**], after hepatic artery stenosis, status post stent.
History of respiratory failure, status post tracheostomy.
Diabetes mellitus.
Chronic renal insufficiency secondary to immunosuppressive toxicity.
Chronic right pleural effusion.
Chronic anasarca.
History of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
History of Clostridium difficile.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The heart was tachycardic without murmurs.
The lungs revealed decreased breath sounds one half way up on the right.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, no masses, no definite ascites.
Extremities - large pitting edema, warm.
Sacral decubitus was noted to be large but did not appear infected.
Urinalysis showed greater than 30 white blood cells with many bacteria.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 119, Q waves in V1 through V3, Q wave in III, T wave inversion in V4, biphasic T waves in V2 and V3, flat T wave in aVL.
Chest x-ray showed a right PICC, postpyloric tube into the duodenum, right sided pleural effusion, no changes.
Pulmonary - On hospital day one, the patient had another episode of acute hypoxia requiring transfer to the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's sputum culture grew out multiresistant Klebsiella and pseudomonas.
It was felt that these organisms were likely colonizers rather than representing infection.
However, early in her hospital stay, the patient was having frequent episodes of desaturation and she was started on Zosyn for possible pneumonia.
As the patient responded to suctioning and quickly improved her oxygen saturation, it was felt that mucous plugging was the most likely cause for hypoxia.
She was also diuresed for some mild congestive heart failure but the ultimate cause of her hypoxia was felt to be due to inability to clear her secretions.
At the time of this dictation, the patient has been stable from her pulmonary status, although still requiring frequent respiratory therapy and suctioning.
In terms of her tracheostomy tube, it was noted that the patient was unable to speak with her Passy-Muir valve in place and it was wondered if there may be some upper airway stenoses causing increased resistance.
ENT was consulted and noted no anatomical problem with the upper airway.
However, she continued to have frank aspiration and therefore this was not a viable option at this time.
Her tracheostomy was changed by ENT to a #6 Shiley cuffed as it was felt that a noncuff would increase the risks for aspiration events.
The patient continued to be too weak to speak with her Passy-Muir valve and it was felt that the valve should not be used until she demonstrated improvement in her strength, decreased her aspiration and we were able to clear her secretions more effectively.
Diarrhea - The patient continued to have profuse watery diarrhea.
Stool lytes were done, which showed evidence of an osmotic diarrhea.
Sacral decubitus - The patient with a large sacral decubitus ulcer which was cared for by the wound care team and then plastic surgery was consulted who did a bedside debridement.
The patient had considerable pain from this ulcer and was treated with Oxycodone.
Initially, the diarrhea complicated the matter as it was very difficult to keep the wound area clean.
There was a question of whether this ulcer could have led to sacral osteomyelitis.
Cardiology - The patient was noted to have episodes of tachy/brady with heart rate going up into the 100 teens and down into the 30s to 40s in a junctional pattern.
They felt that this was likely secondary to her overall status and felt that there was nothing that could be done at this point, that she was not a candidate for a pacer and that this may improve as her overall health improved.
There was no evidence that the patient became symptomatic during these episodes of bradycardia.
Hypertension - The patient was hypertensive throughout her stay and her ace inhibitor was slowly titrated up with a close eye on her blood urea nitrogen and creatinine given her history of acute renal failure, especially in the setting of the Prograf use which was thought to be the likely culprit during her last admission.
Liver - Her alkaline phosphatase remained approximately where it had been, ranging between 800 and 1000.
The patient remained NPO due to her risk of aspiration.
Depression - The patient appeared extremely depressed and at times appeared ready to give up on getting better.
She was on Paxil for depression although this was likely not helping very much.
Anemia - The patient's hematocrit slowly titrated down throughout her stay.
There were no signs of gastrointestinal bleed although this could not necessarily be excluded.
It was felt to be due to blood draws and anemia of chronic disease.
