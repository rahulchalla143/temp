Admission Date:  [**2200-4-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2200-4-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2159-10-27**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital1 **] MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 40-year-old woman is transferred from the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] on [**2200-4-15**] for further management of liver failure.
She has a past medical history significant for HIV and hepatitis C seropositivity.
A liver biopsy in [**2196-2-1**] revealed the presence of grade 2 inflammation and Stage II-III fibrosis.
She initially presented to the ED on [**4-1**] with a three week history of sore throat, pain with swallowing, nasal congestion, cough productive of white sputum, nausea, vomiting, and painful swelling of the left lower extremity.
She reports taking [**1-6**] Extra Strength Tylenol every four hours for several weeks for management of her painful symptoms.
On admission, she was found to be in acute liver failure with AST of 2,158, ALT 948, total bilirubin 6.0, and alkaline phosphatase of 142.
She was additionally found to have pancreatitis with amylase in the 400's and lipase in the 300's.
A summary of her medical problems up until time of transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] is as follows:  1.
Liver disease/pancreatitis:  The patient's acute liver failure was attributed to Tylenol toxicity in the setting of chronic liver disease secondary to hepatitis C.  She was treated with intravenous N-acetylcysteine and her antiretroviral therapy was held.
The pancreatitis was also attributed to acetaminophen toxicity by the Toxicology consult service.
Complications of her liver failure included thrombocytopenia, impaired synthetic function with coagulopathy and hypoalbuminemia, and portal hypertension with ascites and splenomegaly.
She developed epistaxis as well as grossly bloody stools in the course of her hospital stay.
She received several units of fresh-frozen plasma and was transfused a unit of packed red cells for a drop in her hematocrit to 24.2 on [**4-8**].
A MRCP was performed to evaluate for additional causes of pancreatitis and/or obstructive biliary disease.
This study was negative for obstruction of the bile ducts, but did show evidence of acute liver inflammation as well as portal hypertension.
Patient had a brief period of hepatic encephalopathy with confusion and asterixis.
She was placed on lactulose with an appropriate increase in stool output and resolution of her confusion and asterixis.
Cellulitis:  The patient received an ultrasound evaluation of the left lower extremity for her pain, erythema, and swelling on [**2200-4-3**].
The clinical picture was felt to be most consistent with cellulitis, and the patient was started on cefazolin.
Pharyngitis:  The patient was initially felt to most likely have a viral supraglottitis.
The ENT service was consulted and after an evaluation with laryngoscopy, they recommended administration of a proton-pump inhibitor for potential laryngeal reflux.
Swabs for viral culture were obtained and at time of transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**], had not revealed the presence of a viral infection.
Skin changes:  The patient had two bullous skin lesions on her back on admission.
A biopsy revealed changes consistent with bullous impetigo.
HIV:  Patient's HAART was held on admission because of her liver failure.
In summary, the patient's main issues at time of transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] were her continued liver failure, GI bleed of unknown source, persistent left lower extremity cellulitis, and persistent sore throat.
The infection is most likely secondary to heterosexual contact as the patient had a previous significant other who is deceased from HIV.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General:  Pleasant, in no acute distress.
Neck:  Normal jugular venous pressure, no palpable lymphadenopathy.
Heart:  Tachycardic, regular rhythm, grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, no rubs or gallops.
Abdomen:  Slightly distended, diffuse tenderness with maximum tenderness in the lower abdomen, no rebound or guarding, bowel sounds normoactive.
Extremities:  No cyanosis; 3+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally, left calf with a bright red area, warm and tender to palpation (28 x 10 cm in extent).
Neurologic: Alert and oriented times three, speech fluent, thought content appropriate, no asterixis.
Bacterial wound culture with gram-positive cocci in pairs, coagulase negative Staph sparse.
Abdominal ultrasound revealing patent hepatic vasculature, appropriate flow directionality, small fluid around and in the left lower quadrant, edematous gallbladder.
MRCP with pathological enhancement of the liver in the arterial phase consistent with vasospasm due to acute inflammation, portal hypertension, Morgagni hernia with the liver in it, no gallbladder stones, intra or extrahepatic bile duct dilatation, normal evaluation of the pancreas.
Liver failure complicated by hypoalbuminemia with third spacing of fluids, coagulopathy, portal hypertension with mild ascites, splenomegaly with thrombocytopenia, and macrocytic anemia:  The patient continued to be treated supportively for her liver failure.
GI bleed:  On [**4-16**], the patient had hematemesis in the setting of drinking GoLYTELY for colonoscopy prep.
She received an EGD on [**4-17**], which revealed a single oozing 5 mm ulcer in the lower third of the esophagus, normal stomach, and normal duodenum.
No esophageal varices were seen.
An esophageal swab from the ulcer was tested for HSV-I and II.
Left lower extremity cellulitis:  The Infectious Disease service was consulted regarding management of the patient's cellulitis, which appeared to be refractory to antibiotic therapy.
They recommended continuing the Unasyn and obtaining a MRI of the left lower extremity to evaluate for presence of osteomyelitis.
The MRI revealed a large fluid collection tracking down into the calf, potentially representing a ruptured [**Known lastname 4675**] cyst versus an independent infectious process.
A possible aspiration of this fluid to evaluate for infection was considered, but it was decided that a procedure would potentially cause more harm than benefit as the patient had a persistent coagulopathy and could potentially bleed into the space.
Sore throat:  Patient described persistent sore throat.
In their impression, the patient's odynophagia was likely related to candidiasis with overlying reflux.
By time of discharge the patient was symptomatically improved with less of a sore throat.
At the time ([**2200-4-23**]), patient had ulceration with minimal crusting and a pink epithelialized rim of her major back lesion.
She had a lesion on her neck that was ulcerated and oozing brown material.
In the impression of the Dermatology service, the back lesion was healing well and the ulcerated left neck lesion continued to have an element of impetigo.
Persistent coagulopathy:  As aforementioned, the patient had a persistent coagulopathy despite resolution of her elevated transaminases and the administration of vitamin K.  The Hematology service was consulted, and the impression was that the differential diagnosis for the patient's persistent coagulopathy included decreased synthetic function by the liver, DIC, and inhibitor to clotting factors.
The patient was scheduled to followup in Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic for further evaluation of her coagulopathy.
Acute on chronic liver failure secondary to acetaminophen ingestion.
Hepatitis C virus infection.
Human immunodeficiency virus infection.
Left lower extremity cellulitis.
Left lower extremity cystic structure in calf, ruptured [**Known lastname **]s cyst.
Esophageal ulcer.
Laryngeal candidiasis.
Anemia secondary to blood loss with hypoproliferative bone marrow response.
Thrombocytopenia secondary to liver failure and splenic sequestration.
Bullous impetigo.
