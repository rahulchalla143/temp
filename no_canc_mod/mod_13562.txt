Pregnancy uncomplicated until an ultrasound on the day prior to delivery suggested a slightly smaller left ventricle compared to right ventricle.
Mother presented for a cesarean section delivery due to breech presentation.
Upon presentation would flex and grimace but with no spontaneous respirations.
Infant with spontaneous respirations but with retractions and flaring.
Also with cyanosis requiring blow-by oxygen.
The infant was wrapped and taken to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for monitoring of respiratory distress.
Bilateral breath sounds diminished.
RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  The infant initially required blow-by oxygen and received one liter of nasal cannula at 100% for increased respiratory distress.
The infant has had no apnea or bradycardia during this hospitalization.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  Due to prenatal findings of a smaller left ventricle compared to the right ventricle, apraxia test was done which was greater than 300.
No plans for followup.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  Due to increased respiratory distress a complete blood count, differential, and blood cultures were drawn on admission.
Status post respiratory distress.
Status post rule out congenital heart disease; ruled out.
