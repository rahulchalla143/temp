Mr. [**Known lastname 51812**] states that he began to experience a bifrontal headache originally on [**2120-1-19**], which has waxed and waned.
The headache has been accompanied by "blurry vision", which he states that the has had with prior episodes of HA.
He beleves that he had a 'cold' approximately one week ago, with cough, rhinorrhea and subjective fevers.
Since his ED visit, his HA has continued, and he experienced several episodese of emesis (two on [**2120-1-30**], one on [**2120-1-31**]).
He denies photophobia.
No teeth pain.
Mr. [**Known lastname 51812**] was originally diagnosed with HIV [**7-28**] in the setting of a headache, blurred vision, eventually thought to be secondary to CNS toxoplasmosis (serology IgM-/IgG+, though he had multiple ring-enhancing lesions on MRI).
He was treated empirically and was also noted to have elevated CMV VL, treated with valgancyclovir.
He has had intermittent headache since that time, including an admission in [**7-29**] for HA, with a negative LP, though MR with several anomalies (multiple areas of susceptibility with minimal ring enhancement.
ROS is negative for changes in hearing, abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, myalgia, arthralgia, or rash.

_________________________ Radiology: [**2120-1-31**]- CT Head without contrast-There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, midline shift, or mass effect.
Stable small areas of hypoattenuation in the right caudate and putamen, likely related to prior lacunar infarct.
There is evidence of calcification within the basal ganglia.
No acute fracture.
There is mucosal thickening within the right maxillary sinus and possibly a small mucosal polyp in the left maxillary sinus.
Headache Differential diagnosis on admission included migraine, tension headache, HIV related infection, meningitis, or a psychiatric manifestation.
A lumbar puncture was performed with protein and glucose not consistent with a meningitis.
CSF was negative for RPR and cryptococcal antigen.
Pt remained afebrile throughout his hospitalization.
Upon further speaking with patient, and secondary to his recurrent headaches with negative workups in the past, we further explored pt's social situation (see psychiatry below).
Psychiatry- Upon speaking with patient, it was clear that he has depressive symptoms and his social and psychological state was a large contributor to his headache.
Because pt had a negative workup of an infectious etiology, it was thought that his symptoms could be attributable to this, as had been thought about in the past by his infectious disease doctors.
Pt said that he had decreased concentration, insomnia, and poor appetite.
He denied suicidal ideations, saying that he would never consider it because he has a lot of faith and he is a religious man.
They believed that he had a mood disorder secondary to his medical condition of HIV.
Pt had no focal neurological deficits, no change in mental status, and blurry vision remitted.
This was likely due to the above as well.
Pain - Pt had back pain secondary to the LP and also with a headache ([**10-5**]).
Pt required morphine in the ED for headache and back pain.
The back pain resolved upon discharge.
Nausea - Pt was written for prn Compazine.
