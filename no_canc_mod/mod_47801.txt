Name:  [**Known lastname 32**], [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]              Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 17429**]  Admission Date:  [**2189-9-29**]     Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2155-6-30**]     Sex:  F   ADDENDUM: HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with the complaints as above including chest pain and shortness of breath: she was initially felt to have a left upper lobe and a left lower lobe thrombus of indeterminate age according to CT scan.
The Indomethacin was changed in the face of hematocrit drop and gastrointestinal bleeding to Vioxx in the dosage of 50 mg po q day on [**10-4**], although it was initially suspected that the patient might have pneumonia, she did not present with a fever nor did she present with an elevated white blood cell count.
CT surgery consult on [**9-30**] suggested the differential diagnosis of post pericardiotomy syndrome vs pericarditis vs recurrent PE with lower lobe pneumonia.
The patient was noted at the time of admission to have a pericardial effusion.
To the date of this admission, this pericardial effusion did not lead to signs of tamponade nor was there radiographic evidence of such.
Bronchoscopy performed on [**10-2**] showed dynamic collapse throughout with moderate amount of purulent secretions throughout the left bronchi.
Echocardiography on [**10-3**] continued to show small circumferential pericardial effusion.
A nasogastric lavage was dip positive for blood but there was no gross blood at that time.
The patient continued to have OB positive stools and hematocrit stabilized post transfusion.
The patient was again sent for bronchiolar alveolar lavage with transbronchial biopsy of the lingula on [**10-5**] which again showed diffuse dynamic collapse and purulent secretions form the left and now from the right upper and middle lobe as well.
It was suggested that the patient be checked for HIV which ultimately returned negative because of the suggestion was made in light of the patient's continuing pneumonic processes without elevated white count or fever.
On [**10-5**] intern was called to see the patient for shortness of breath, status post bronchoscopy with oxygen saturation approximately 68% on three liters, increasing only to 88% on five liters as well as tachypnea.
The patient, at that time was diuresed for presumed pulmonary edema and was also given nebulizers and improved and stayed on the floor.
On [**10-7**] the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for increasing dyspnea and desaturation on non rebreather on the floor.
In the MICU the patient was treated with Ceftaz and Clindamycin for a presumed nosocomial pneumonia and/or aspiration pneumonia and aggressively was diuresed for pulmonary edema.
Bronchial alveolar lavage is negative, tissue is negative, washings were negative as were pleural fluid and blood cultures negative at the time.
On [**10-14**] CT of the chest showed diffuse ground glass appearance in the right lung and in the focal region on the left lung which could represent the infectious process.
A  hemorrhage or diffuse alveolar damage although it was considered odd that it was less than unilateral, oxygen requirements in the MICU decreased with diuresis in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient on [**10-14**] required only 50% Venti Mask and oxygen saturation of 96 and was transferred back to the floor.
It was still unclear whether the patient had actually originally had a pneumonia or other pneumonic process.
Interventional pulmonology was reconsulted who suggested holding on empiric steroids but pursuing the possibility of open lung biopsy to confirm or rule out the possibility of post pericardial injuries.
