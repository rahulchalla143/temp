Admission Date:  [**2113-9-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2113-9-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2113-9-15**]       Sex:  M  Service:  NEONATOLOGY HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 43526**] is a 36 6/7 weeks 2225 gram male newborn with a prenatal diagnosis of arachnoid cyst vs. Dandy-Walker variant, who was admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and management.
This pregnancy was notable for an increased alpha-fetoprotein.
A follow-up MRI at approximately 20 weeks gestational age revealed an intact spinal cord, age-appropriate lissencephalic cerebrum, a posterior fossa enlarged fourth ventricle (lateral ventricles normal size), unclear of vermis displaced or underdeveloped, no other fetal anomalies.
Pregnancy also notable for poor fetal growth.
The family met with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from [**Hospital3 1810**] Neurology for an antenatal consult.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed with the family that findings may be consistent with an arachnoid cyst vs. a Dandy-Walker variant.
Family history significant for autism in a second cousin and another cousin with cerebral palsy after perinatal asphyxia.
The mother was induced due to concerns of pregnancy-induced hypertension and poor fetal growth.
Skin:  Smooth, pink, several pustular lesions scattered over torso and legs, consistent with pustular melanosis.
Thorax symmetrical.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm, no murmur auscultated.
Spine straight, no dimples or masses noted.
He has not had any desaturations or oxygen requirement during his hospitalization.
No fluid boluses or support with pressors has been required.
He did, however, have some hypoglycemia with dextrose sticks dipping down into the 40 to 50 range, requiring addition of Polycose 4 calories/ounce to his formula.
He has been voiding and stooling without difficulty.
Infectious Disease:  There was minimal risk for sepsis on this infant.
Neurology:  Head ultrasound on day of life four was consistent with a Dandy-Walker variant, showing splayed cerebellar hemispheres, fluid collection connected to the fourth ventricle by a narrow channel.
Issues of hypoglycemia resolved.
The circumcision site is without erythema or bleeding.
Immunizations recommended:  Synagis respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks gestation; (2) Born between 32 and 35 weeks, with plans for day care during respiratory syncytial virus season, with a smoker in the household, or with preschool siblings; or (3) With chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for pre-term infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other care givers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Fetal cerebellar anomaly, Dandy-Walker variant versus arachnoid cyst 2.
