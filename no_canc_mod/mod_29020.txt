Head CT demonstrated small scalp hematoma, w/ no evidence of intracranial or C-spine trauma.
Serial evaluation in the ED demonstrated worsening mental status; after 2 hours the pt was unresponsive to painful stimuli, and minimally responsive to deep painful stimuli.
He was intubated for airway protection and ventilation in the setting of altered mental status, and the MICU was called for further evaluation.

Other possible etiologies include separate toxic/metabolic problems and intracranial hemorrhage.
However, UTOX and STOX were negative except for alcohol, pt denied other ingestions once extubated, there were no metabolic derangements, and head CTs pre/post intubation were normal.
The morning after his admission his propofol was stopped and he was extubated without difficulty.
There was no hyperglycemia, ketonuria, serum ASA, or other apparent cause of gap acidosis.
EtOH abuse: discussed with patient gravity of admission event and concern that he could have developed a serious illness (eg aspiration pneumonia) or died had he not been in a monitored setting with airway protection.
