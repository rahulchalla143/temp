There was no associated trauma or injury.
The pain is in his central lower back, is present almost all the time, and varies in severity up to [**11-4**].
He has also noticed increased abdominal distention in the last few days.
He has tried tylenol for pain without much relief.
Other than his lovenox and coumadin, he has no new medications or changes in his medication.
He was then noted to have systolic pressures in the 70s and he was complaining of lightheadedness; he was transferred to the core.
EKG showed paced rhythm and hematocrit was noted to be 31.4 from 39.2 one week prior.
CTA was done for concern of dissection and showed a left RP bleed with active extravasation at the left iliacus muscle.
He received D5W with bicarb for renal protection.
The patient received 4mg IV morphine x 2 for abdominal pain when pressures were improved, with improvement in pain.
FAST exam showed a small pericardial effusion.
Cardiology recommended slow reversal with FFP; no indication for vitamin K. In ED, unable to place Foley due to resistance.
Mechanical AV: Pt had bicuspid AV requiring replacement.

mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 93613**] for sub therapeutic [**Date range (3) 263**] now on Lovenox bridge and Coumadin who presents with 2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma .
# RETROPERITONEAL BLEED.
He was found to have a large retroperitoneal hematoma with evidence of active arterial extravasation on imaging in the setting of a supra therapeutic [**Date range (3) 263**] and Lovenox bridge.
The general surgery, vascular surgery, and interventional radiology services were consulted for possible operative/procedural management.
He underwent mesenteric angiogram although an active source of bleeding was not able to be identified.
He developed hypotension requiring vasopressor support.
He developed worsening renal failure with limited urine output, elevated bladder pressures, and elevated CK levels concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.
The patient developed oliguric acute renal failure initially due to hypovolemia in the setting of acute bleed, later exacerbated by abdominal compartment syndrome.
# MECHANICAL AORTIC VALVE: The patient was found to have a supra therapeutic [**Date range (3) 263**] in the setting of anticoagulation with Coumadin with a Lovenox bridge.
# FEVER: He developed a fever to greater than 101 on hospital day 3.
There was concern for pneumonia given evidence of a new infiltrate on imaging so he was empirically started on broad spectrum antibiotics... .
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
Metoprolol was initially held in the setting of active bleeding.
# CAD s/p CABG.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA.
His simvastatin was held in the setting of increasing CK levels.
# HYPERTENSION.
His home lisinopril, metoprolol, HCTZ were initially held in the setting of active bleeding.
General surgery was consulted for retroperitoneal bleed secondary to anticoagulation.
IR consulted, recommended Ultrasound-guided left common femoral artery access, abdominal aortogram, it reveled extensive atherosclerotic disease as seen on prior CT, no active contrast extravasation identified.
Serial hematocrits slowly treading down.
IV Lasix given with minimal response.
Concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome.
CVL and Left IJ line placed  [**2142-5-17**] patient was taken to the OR for abdominal compartment syndrome due to left retroperitoneal and sigmoid mesenteric hematoma status post decompressive laparotomy with evacuation of retroperitoneal hematoma and packing for hemostasis, placement of silo closure with reinforced Silastic.
[**2142-5-18**] Reopening of prior laparotomy for removal of packing, abdominal washout and partial closure.
[**2142-5-21**] Abdominal washout and partial closure; [**Last Name (un) **] gastrostomy; drain retroperitoneal hematoma.
[**2142-5-23**] Transfused 1 unit pRBC  [**2142-5-24**] Patient underwent thoracentesis for bilateral pleural effusions.
Noted to have decreased movement in his right, CT scan head showed chronic infarct within the right PCA territory (present on CT from [**2139**]).
Hypo density noted within the margin between the left PCA and MCA, suggestive of possible subacute watershed infarct, neurology recommended to maintain anticoagulation with goal PTT 50-70 to avoid new embolic events, though current infarct was likely watershed in the context of hypotension to the 70s systolic.
ARF for hypovolemia improving.
VAC removed; Adaptic and gauze with wound VAC dressing ng overlying.
[**2142-6-11**] Ct scan torso: Newly distended gallbladder with wall edema, internal sludge, and a gallstone, concerning for cholecystitis.
Stable retroperitoneal hematoma and anterior fluid collection, not significantly changed in size since the prior examination.
No new fluid collection seen.
Large amount of mesenteric stranding and edema about a large abdominal wall defect, compatible with post-surgical changes.
[**2142-6-14**] perch drain placement x2 by IR ID summary: Over the past 10 days he has been intermittently hypotensive, febrile with a leukocytosis which raises concern for an infected source.
He is at risk for a number of sources of infection, most obviously is his RP hematoma and open abdominal wound which now has a drain placed in the hematoma.
He has pleural effusions, his nurse reports increased secretions and now has GNR and GPC's from his sputum which may indicate a pulmonary source of infection and a hospital acquired source of infection is of additional concern.
He has been a on a chronic quinolone prophylaxis for years and now has increased diarrhea in the setting of a rising WCC, which raises the possibility of C difficile.
This should provide broad gram positive, fungal and anaerobic coverage as well as some gram negative coverage.
Should he decompensate overnight we recommend switching his levofloxacin for Meropenem which would provide broader gram negative coverage.
Successful CT-guided drainage of a large retroperitoneal collection likely hematoma.
Drain was placed in the left psoas collection, however no fluid was drained.
[**2142-6-16**] confused but otherwise stable in TSICU  [**2142-6-17**] Ceftriaxone started for E coli in sputum  [**2142-6-18**] d/c VAC Speech and swallow evaluation suggest initiating a PO diet of thin liquids and moist, ground solids when fully awake and alert.
1:1 supervision- hold meals if too lethargic.
[**2142-6-20**] Patient had massive GI bleeding, coded in the floor was intubated on mechanical ventilation, transfused and fluid resuscitated, on pressors EGD today revealed severe erythema and ulceration in the entire visualized area from the duodenum and up to proximal jejunum consistent with diffuse bowel ischemia.
Recommend PPI gtt or pantoprazole 40 mg IV BID to prevent further acid induced damage to the duodenum - Poor prognosis.
EEG This is an abnormal portable EEG due to a burst suppression pattern which can be seen in anoxic ischemic encephalopathy secondary to cardiac arrest or in the setting of high dose sedating medications like Midazolam.
In the absence of high dose sedating medications, the presence of a burst suppression pattern is a poor prognostic sign.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were seen during this recording.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: New diagnosis  Retroperitoneal hematoma secondary to anticoagulation.
