Was also found to have a dilated right ventricle on a TEE, but without clear-cut left to right shunting at a degree that would cause such a dilation of the right ventricle.
For further exploration she underwent a cardiac MRI at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-16**] that showed a significant left to right shunting with Qp/Qs flow at 2.6.
She did not have any chest pain but she took 2 SL nitroglycerin and then took her night dose metoprolol finally with improvement.
She continues to complain of feeling extremely fatigued.
She denies any chest pain.
She presented for cardiac catherization prior to correction of her anomalous pulmonary veins which showed no significant coronary artery disease.
She had an E coli urinary tract infection which was treated prior to her same day admission for surgery.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms.[**Known lastname **]  presented for cardiac catherization prior to correction of her anomalous pulmonary veins which showed no significant coronary artery disease.
Her preoperative workup revealed an E coli urinary tract infection which was treated prior to her same day admission for surgery.
On [**2148-8-1**] she was taken to the operating room and underwent repair of  partial anomalous pulmonary venous return and sinus venosus atrial septal defect, and closure of patient foramen ovale.
She awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without difficulty.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
