Admission Date:  [**2153-12-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2154-1-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2081-10-15**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 41485**] is a 72 year old female with a history of hypertension who presented to an outside Emergency Department after she experienced the sudden onset of low back pain.
She had associated symptoms including abdominal pain which was a band-like pain and constant, diaphoresis, and nausea and vomiting.
There was no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no lightheadedness.
There were no paresthesias or weakness.
She has never had any such pain before in her life.
At the outside hospital, an abdominal ultrasound was performed which revealed aortic dissection.
Polymyalgia rheumatica.
Status post removal of part of the pancreas, right nephrectomy and splenectomy due to a pancreatic cyst which was later found to be benign.
Physical examination is notable for regular rate and rhythm, with no evidence of aortic insufficiency murmur.
There are no carotid bruits.
There is no abdominal bruit.
There are no ST segment elevations or Q waves.
CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed an aortic dissection extending from the level of the pulmonary vein beyond the left subclavian and into the celiac artery but not including the celiac artery.
There was no evidence of contract extravasation.
There is no ascending aortic involvement.
There is no aortic arch involvement.
AORTIC DISSECTION:  The patient was admitted with a Type B aortic dissection.
She was noted to have a very labile systolic blood pressure.
During the course of the hospitalization, the patient complained of left flank pain which was positional.
It showed no extension of the aortic dissection.
CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT:  On admission, the patient had no focal neurological findings.
The patient was examined and was found to have no appreciable weakness on examination.
Her blood pressure was being tightly controlled with a goal systolic blood pressure between 100 and 120 due to her Type B aortic dissection.
At one point, she was noted to have very labile blood pressures and became briefly hypotensive but she quickly returned to baseline after Nipride drip was turned off.
The patient again complained of weakness in the right leg greater than the right arm.
Again, neurological examination showed some mild right upper extremity weakness with four out of five strength proximally but no pronator drift on examination.
She was also noted to have give-way weakness of the right lower extremity.
An MRI / MRA of the brain was obtained which showed possible narrowing of the left posterior cerebral artery and inferior division of the left middle cerebral artery origin, but the study was severely limited by motion.
It also showed a left sided subcortical subacute watershed infarction of the posterior frontal lobe and extending into the parietal lobe and toward the posterior portion of the lateral ventricle.
RHEUMATOLOGY:  On admission, the patient was noted to have arthritic changes of the hand.
There was concern that possibly the patient may have a vascular disease which may be effecting her aorta and thus leading to her aortic dissection.
Work-up included as follows: Plain x-rays of the hand showed findings most consistent with osteoarthritis.
Rheumatology noted that given the patient's past medical history of polymyalgia rheumatica that giant cell arteritis is associated with aortic dissection.
However, the patient had no jaw claudication or temporal tenderness on examination.
Based on these, were not consistent with giant cell arteritis.
They felt that her physical examination findings were most consistent with osteoarthritis and recommended continuing Vioxx.
Rheumatology also noted that renal artery stenosis can be associated with certain arthritides.
Abdomen CT angiogram showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis in her one remaining renal artery.
During the hospital stay, the Foley was removed, however, the patient had difficulty holding her urine and difficulty getting up out of bed to go to the urinal.
The patient states that she has a history of urinary incontinence at home.
A Foley catheter was in place due to urinary incontinence which is an old medical problem.
She is chest pain and back pain free with no evidence of continuing dissection.
The patient continues to have difficulty ambulating due to her right lower extremity weakness but has good use of the right upper extremity, and no evidence of cranial nerve involvement or sensory deficit.
Ischemic stroke (watershed infarction of the left middle cerebral artery territory).
Urinary incontinence.
