No pulmonary embolism.
Multiple chest x-rays repeatedly showing a left-sided pleural effusion with opacification of the right chest wall.
A renal ultrasound showed swollen echogenic kidneys; in keeping with a history of possible acute renal failure.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
No evidence of a mass or stone.
A magnetic resonance imaging of the chest and mediastinum with and without contrast following was recent ultrasound examination demonstrated thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein, occlusion versus narrowing of the left brachiocephalic vein, consolidation of the left upper lobe and lingula, multiple cavitations in the right upper lobe, and a large left pleural effusion.
Bilateral lower extremity Doppler studies showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
Magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen, pelvis, and kidneys showed no evidence of tumor within the abdomen, pelvis, or kidneys.
It showed a moderate left-sided pleural effusion.
No evidence of renal vein thrombosis.
This was considered negative for malignancy.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was obtained to evaluate for pericardial constriction showed a normal left ventricular cavity size, with normal regional and global ventricular systolic function, normal right ventricular cavity size.
No myocardial infarction evidence, pericardial thickening, adhesions, or reconstruction.
A large left pleural effusion and evidence of increased intravascular pressure.
Overall, no evidence of pericardial constriction.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is a 54-year-old Asian male with a history of adenocarcinoma of the right lung (status post lung resection) and history of pulmonary tuberculosis as a teenager who presented to the hospital on [**2133-5-29**] complaining of a several day history of shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea on exertion, and bilateral lower extremity edema; who was ultimately discharged on [**2133-6-19**].
PULMONARY ISSUES:   The patient continued to have shortness of breath secondary to a recurrent left-sided pleural effusion.
During his hospital stay he was tapped with thoracentesis three times with relief of symptoms; however, the patient had repeated fluid reaccumulation.
Ultimately, the etiology of the pleural effusion remained unclear.
The patient was treated for a pneumonia early in his hospital course with azithromycin for seven days with no apparent change.
The patient had a bronchoscopy on [**6-5**] which was highly suggestive of atypical cells; consistent with adenocarcinoma of the lung.
However, no biopsy was performed as no mass was identified.
A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a large pleural effusion; however, there was no constriction (based on the Cardiology interpretation).
The patient also had multiple chest magnetic resonance imaging studies and computed tomographies which demonstrated no obvious cause for the recurrent pleural effusions; however, a further study will be complained on [**6-24**] when the patient undergoes a positron emission tomography of the chest.
At this time, the suspicion of malignancy cells needs to be confirmed, and the recurrent pleural effusion seemed most probably related to a malignancy.
However, the patient's complex course also included kidney disease with a diagnosis of probable immunoglobulin A nephropathy; question nephritis versus nephrosis possibly leading to the accumulation of the effusion.
Prior to admission, the Interventional Pulmonology Clinic placed a Pleur-X drain which will need to be repeatedly drained to help improve shortness of breath.
A pleurodesis was determined to be a risky procedure in a patient with limited pulmonary reserve and only one functioning lung.
From a pulmonary standpoint, the patient was discharged home on oxygen, Lovenox for seven days (covering his internal jugular deep venous thrombosis with no evidence of pulmonary embolism) with followup to be coordinated with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 217**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (his pulmonologist and oncologist) following completion of the positron emission tomography scan.
RENAL ISSUES:  The patient initially presented with what was thought to be a picture consistent with acute renal failure.
A magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen and pelvis showed that there was no deep venous thrombosis or renal vein thrombosis.
The patient was given a tentative diagnosis of probable immunoglobulin A nephropathy and/or nephritic versus nephrotic syndrome.
However, the patient refused an inpatient renal biopsy which hindered a confirmatory pathological diagnosis.
The patient was markedly proteinuric and had marked hematuria in his urine.
He had elevated blood pressures.
However, by discharge his urine protein to creatinine ratio had increased back to 5, and he remained moderately hypertensive in the 140s with proteinuria and hematuria in his urine.
The plan on discharge was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1366**] in his clinic for scheduling of a renal biopsy.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient had marked anemia which progressed throughout his hospital course.
However, the patient did continue to have hematuria and has been instructed to have close followup for his hematocrit.
The patient was initiated on his Coumadin treatment today for treatment of his internal jugular deep venous thrombosis.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient ruled out for any evidence of constrictive pericarditis.
There was marked discrepancy in the notes in terms of blood pressure recordings.
Dyspnea and shortness of breath.
Recurrent left pleural effusion.
Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Acute renal failure.
Nephritic syndrome.
Nephrotic syndrome.
The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 217**] (from Pulmonary) for management of pulmonary symptoms.
The patient was to follow up with Urology for cystoscopy.
The patient was to follow up with oncologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) after positron emission tomography scan.
