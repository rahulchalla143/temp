She has a history of severe [**Hospital3 1106**] disease with a complete occlusion of the left carotid and a left hemispheric stroke, as well as b/l AKAs secondary to peripheral [**Hospital3 1106**] disease.
Her daughter who was present in the [**Name (NI) **] stated that she had recovered much of her speech but still had some difficulty getting words out.
She has not been by her nursing home in the last few days but had not heard any report of illness, cough, cold, or GI problems.

No definite acute intracranial hemorrhage  EEG [**2178-5-31**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG in the awake and asleep states due to the presence of intermittent right mid-temporal epileptiform discharges.
These findings are indicative of an active epileptogenic focus in the right temporal region.
In addition, the background activity is diffusely slow indicative of a moderate encephalopathy which suggests widespread cerebral dysfunction but is non-specific as to etiology.
No electrographic seizures are present.
Note is made of an irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation.
It showed no evidence of seizures.
There were no prominent focal abnormalities but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
Acute infarction of the right basal ganglia with very slight mass effect on the adjacent right lateral ventricle and evidence of recent hemorrhagic conversion.
Acute infarction of the right posterior temporal and right medial parietal lobe.
Absence of the flow void in the left internal carotid artery indicating probable occlusion, likely chronic.
Stable encephalomalacia in the left temporal and left cerebellum, suggestive of prior infarctions.
Increase in opacification in the left lung is attributable to very mild edema, but on the right the change is more pronounced with a more nodular component which suggests developing aspiration pneumonia.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
CXR [**2178-6-3**]: Patient is rightward shifted which projects the large heart over the right lower lung, but nevertheless, there is clearly progressive opacification of the right lung and decrease in volume of the right hemithorax suggesting a large component of atelectasis, conceivably obscuring pneumonia, but not necessarily.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
At least a small right pleural effusion, new or increased since [**6-2**], is presumed.
A new lead runs parallel to the left clavicle ending in the midline, but I do not recognize it.
There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
EEG [**2178-6-4**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The background remained markedly suppressed throughout.
Nevertheless, there were no clearly epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 year-old woman with a history of hemispheric L MCA stroke, L carotid occlusion, severe PVD s/p b/l AKA's who presented after being found seizing in bed at her nursing facility.
Upon arrival here she was intubated and sedated with no further signs of seizure activity.
Initial exam revealed intact brainstem reflexes but was otherwise very limited due to her sedation.
CT showed encephalomalacia of the left hemisphere, and UA was grossly positive.
On exam she was noted to be moving her right side more than left, inconsistent with her prior large L hemispheric stroke.
Routine EEG on [**5-31**] also showed R temporal spikes without clinical correlate.
She was continued on Keppra and connected to LTM, which showed an encephalopathic background in delta-theta frequences without further evidence of epileptiform activity.
An MRI was performed on [**6-2**] which showed multiple new strokes in R MCA distribution with hemorrhagic conversion in R basal ganglia.
Most likely source was presumed to be embolic from atrial fibrillation, but may also be related to [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] stenosis/occlusion given hx of L carotid occlusion and severe PVD.
Aggrenox was discontinued in the setting of hemorrhage and she was switched to aspirin.
CV: She was maintained on telemetry monitoring during her admission which revealed atrial fibrillation.
Aggrenox was switched to aspirin after she was found to have hemorrhagic conversion of new infarct.
Her FSs and ISS were stopped when she was made CMO.
ID: She continued to have intermittent fevers throughout her admission.
UA was positive upon admission and she was initially started on ceftriaxone for empiric treatment.
CXR subsequently began to show evidence of aspiration pneumonia vs. VAP and her antibiotic coverage was broadened to linezolid/cefepime.
Sputum culture showed GPC in pairs and clusters.
Pulm: She was maintained on mechanical ventilation and was unable to be weaned due to her poor mental status and lack of gag reflex.
Code status: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was initially full code upon admission as confirmed with her husband and son.
After she was found to have new R sided strokes and continued to deteriorate, a family meeting was held on [**6-3**].
Medications on Admission: Aggrenox Insulin Metoprolol Zoloft Zocor Trazadone MVI Vitamin D  Discharge Medications: N/A, pt expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: R MCA infarcts Seizures Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Expired   Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 1170**] on [**2178-5-30**] after being found seizing at home.
An MRI of her brain was then performed which showed multiple strokes in the right side of her brain, in addition to her previous large area of stroke in the left side of her brain.
She also developed a severe pneumonia which was treated with antibiotics.
Given her poor prognosis and low likelihood of recovery, her family decided to make her care focused on comfort measures only.
