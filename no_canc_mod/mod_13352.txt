Admission Date:  [**2161-5-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-6-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Demerol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: Torn medial meniscus shortness of breath bronchospasm  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Medial meniscus repair.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known firstname 17937**] [**Known lastname 6633**] is a 53 yo female with PmHx of asthma, colon cancer s/p resection, HTN, osteoarthritis who was admitted for elective R knee arthroscopy [**2161-5-6**].
Although she appeared to tolerate her surgery well, her immediate post-op course was complicated by diffuse wheeze and hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear etiology (?bronchospastic adverse durg reaction) shortly after the LMA was removed, necessitating intubation.
Of note, her post-intubation chest film did not reveal any infiltrates.
Her MICU course was notable for several complications, as follows.
1) respiratory failure.
2) She was noted to have a lactic acidosis, with lactate up to 11 [**5-6**], perhaps secondary to adverse reaction to propofol versus ?albuterol.
3) She complained of L-sided CP, and was noted to have T wave flattening in the lat leads.
An echo revealed an EF of 65%, with nl LV thickness and wall motion, and [**1-25**]+ MR. .
GI was consulted, who felt that her coffee grounds may have been secondary to stress gastritis in the setting of high-dose steroids, and she was begun on frequent PPI.
5) HTN - patient has been noted to have significant HTN, with SBPs in the low 200s associated with mild HA.

Respiratory failure: likely [**2-25**] asthma flare possibly from instrumentation vs. adverse medication reaction vs. aspiration.
CP: Currently chest pain free.
Prior lateral T wave flattening, ?etiology given serially negative cardiac enzymes.
However, it is noteworthy that the CP occurred in the setting of coffee-ground emesis, and may actually have been GI in origin.
s/p arthroscopy: Wound was healing well and eventually tolerated weight bearing with physical therapy.
Gastritis: Suspect coffee grounds were secondary to stress gastritis as above.
Suspect anemia of chronic dz.
No intercurrent fevers or leukocytosis.
Dispo: Patient was afebrile with stable vital signs on the day of discharge.
She had no further comnplaints and was able to bear weight on her knee s/p arthroscopy.
She was without wheezing or rales on physical [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] and was euvolemic.
Follow-up: With PCP for asthma management during rapid prednisone taper, management of anemia, and for exercise tolerance testing or pharmacological stress (as limited by asthma).
With GI for outpatient EGD for possible stress gastroenteritis).
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual ASDIR (AS DIRECTED) as needed for pain: please let 1 tablet every 5 minutes for persistant chest pain.
