), OSA on nocturnal Bipap, admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2128-5-3**] with subacute respiratory distress, started on broad spectrum antibiotics, transfered to MICU this AM because of worsening respiratory distress, found to have multifocal pneumonia, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
He was admitted most recently to [**Hospital1 1474**] on [**2128-5-3**] at which time he was not able to provide much clinical history but had been having worsening shortness of breath as well as significant diarrhea and fever to 103F, stating that he had been feeling sick for a long time.
He was noted to be somewhat somnolent, easily falling asleep, increased oxygen requirement.
He had also reported increasing weight and leg edema over the last several days to weeks.
He was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Cipro in the ED for hospital-acquired pneumonia coverage after right-sided infiltrate was seen on CXR.
ABG showed hypoxemia and hyercapnea, though hypercapnea was presumed to be at his baseline.
CXR done also in setting of spiking fevers showed new developing infiltrate.
He was transfered to CCU for worsening multifocal pneumonia and heart failure.
On arrival, the patient was in no acute distress but having some difficulty breathing.
He did have a large loose bowel movement on arrival.
He denies nausea currently, but states that he did have an episode of emesis earlier today.
Patient states that abdomen has been increasingly distended over the last several weeks, as well as increased lower extremity edema.
Over the phone, his wife believes the patient had an aspiration episode at some point in the last few weeks, though unclear when, perhaps at home; wife has been in the hospital for a few weeks, so she does not know details of recent history well.
Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] [**Date range (1) 89899**] for presumed COPD exacerbation triggered by viral illness, including self-limited nausea/vomiting, diarrhea.
He had a fever to 100.8, no pneumonia seen on CXR, negative blood cultures.
He was admitted from [**Date range (1) 17717**] for ankle edema and atypical chest pain, diuresed effectively, thought to have poor compliance with low sodium diet.

Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2128-5-9**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
Imaging: [**2128-5-7**] CXR: There is a right-sided PICC line whose distal tip is low and has an unusual course with the distal tip to the left of midline.
There is prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings as well as more focal areas of consolidation at the lung bases.
This may be due to combination of fluid overload as well as developing infiltrates, particularly at the lung bases.
There is calcification along the right hemidiaphragm which is stable since the [**2126**] study and may be due to pleural plaques.
There are mildly prominent loops of small bowel which are air filled in the left abdomen.
Overall, these findings are nonspecific and there are no signs for small-bowel obstruction.
No extraluminal contrast is seen.
There is no free air in the abdomen or pelvis.
[**2128-5-9**] CXR: Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and there is persistent vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness.
This may reflect asymmetrical edema, but superimposed infection is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
Small pleural effusions are again demonstrated as well as pleural plaques, the latter consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
No evidence for DVT.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.
No significant valvular abnormality.
for CAD, COPD on 4L O2, HTN, OSA who was transferred from [**Hospital1 1474**] with multifocal pneumonia, transferred to MICU on [**2128-5-7**] for respiratory distress, improved on vanco/levofloxacin, and transferred to Medical service on [**2128-5-9**].
NICU COURSE: The patient was admitted to the ICU on [**2128-5-7**] for respiratory distress which was thought to be multifactorial from a possible PNA, obstructive sleep apnea, and fluid overload.
Imdur, Metoprolol and Lisinopril were initially held in the setting of acute illness but Imdur and Metoprolol were restarted on [**2128-5-9**].
He was not placed on full dose of Lantus insulin due to decreased PO intake and fingersticks were in the normal range.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF:  Repeat ECHO showed stable EF.
However, he developed hypovolemia with increasing Cr, BUN, and contraction alkalosis, and further diuresis was held for 48 hours prior to discharge with stabilization of Cr at 1.6.
# Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr is ~1.3.
However, he developed hypovolemia with increasing Cr, BUN, and contraction alkalosis, and further diuresis was held for 48 hours prior to discharge with stabilization of Cr at 1.6.
While he was in the MICU, he developed penile bleeding, likely from traumatic Foley placement; however ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], cryoglobulin, and anti-GBM were sent to eval for pulmonary-renal syndromes and were all unremarkable.
# L leg pain/swelling:  Patient developed L > R pedal edema.
Ultrasound was negative for DVT.
# Urinary retention:  Patient was noted to have urinary retention.
# COPD:  He did not have an acute exacerbation.
# DM2, uncontrolled, with complications:  Initially, he had issues with hypoglycemia, requiring decreased insulin dosing compare to prior.
# Obstructive sleep apnea:  Patient utilizes CPAP overnight.
