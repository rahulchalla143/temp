FINDINGS: There has been slight interval evolution of the previously identified scattered peripheral intraparenchymal hemorrhages, most pronounced in the inferior temporal lobes.
There is also slight increase conspicuously of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe as well as a lesser degree in the right frontal lobe.
No other areas of hemorrhage are identified.
There remains no shift of normally midline structures or mass effect.
Slight interval evolution of previously identified intraparenchymal hemorrhages and slight increase conspicuously of bilateral frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No new areas of hemorrhage identified.
She did spike fevers and was found to have an aspiration pneumonia and started on antibiotics.
She improved neurologically but continued to have problems with memory.
These numbers were felt to be related to her traumatic injury and pneumonia and not any chronic process.
