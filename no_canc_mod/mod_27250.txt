The shortness of breath started about 40 minutes before the chest pain while she was making dinner.
She described substernal chest pain and tightness that was acute in onset and felt similar to her prior MI, but not as severe.
It did not radiate to her arm or jaw, and was not associated with nausea or diaphoresis.
On the way to the hospital she took 3 of her husband's sublingual nitroglycerine tabs which provided minimal relief of the chest pain.
Chronic lower back pain 4.
Also had abd CT negative, Chest CT demonstrated LUL nodule which was monitered.
Had recent scan that demonstrated increase in size of LUL nodule from 3mm->7mm, PET scan in [**12-11**] negative - scheduled to have repeat Chest CT this month.

Studies: [**2112-10-12**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with a late cycle atrial premature beat.
Q-T interval prolongation.
Anterior myocardial infarction.
Low voltage throughout.
T wave abnormalites and Q-T interval prolongation persist.
[**2112-10-12**] ECHO: No pericardial effusion or tamponade.
Regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with prior LAD infarction.
[**2112-10-11**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Approved: No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
[**2112-10-11**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
Low limb lead voltage.Late R wave progression.
Q-T interval prolongation with marked precordial ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2112-9-9**] there is new Q-T interval prolongation with prominent precordial T wave inversions.
Consider infarction or metabolic derangements.

Hypotension on presentation required MICU stay with peripheral dopamine.
# Hypotension: She was hypotensive to the 70s systolic on arrival to [**Hospital3 **], which was likely due to a recently started beta-blocker in the setting of her systolic heart failure and possible volume depletion from decreased PO intake leading up to admission.
There was no evidence of adrenal insufficiency with cortisol stimulation testing.
Whether or not to re-start her BBlocker and ACEi should be discussed at her cardiology follow up in a few days.
Given recent weight loss, there was concern that poor nutritional status was resulting in a decreased oncotic pressure in the vasculature, but albumin was 3.7.
On discharge, she was hemodynamically stable without orthostasis and denied any symptoms of feelings of lightheadedness or feeling unsteady.
# Chest pain: She had substernal chest pain and tightness that was acute in onset and felt similar to her prior MI.
The pain was mildly relieved by 3 of her husband's expired sublingual nitroglycerine tabs.
She had new T-wave inversions in V2-V4 on her initial ECG.
Her chest pain resolved without further intervention and had no complaints of chest pain throughout her admission.
# CAD - NSTEMI in [**2108**] and STEMI in 09/[**2112**].
She had not been taking furosemide or HCTZ since STEMI in 09/[**2112**].
# Acute kidney injury: Her baseline creatinine is 0.4-0.5, but was up to 1.1 on arrival likely from volume depletion.
# Depression: She has a history of depression with suicide attempts.
# Chronic pain: Continue home gabapentin and oxycodone for her chronic back pain.
6. quetiapine 25 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hypotension .
Secondary: Coronary artery disease  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were initially admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) for management of low blood pressure.
We did not find any evidence of an infection causing low blood pressure.
We checked to make sure you did not have another heart attack.
