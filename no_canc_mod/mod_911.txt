Right subcapital femoral neck fracture: Pt was not in pain prior to operation, fracture was found due to fall at home and inability to ambulate.
On [**7-26**] he went to the OR for a right hip hemiarthroplasty.
During his post-op course, coumadin was restarted and the pt developed a large hematoma in the wound bed requiring pRBCs and surgical evacuation on [**7-28**].
Post-operatively, he was still AOx0 but less alert, and as his course continued he became progressively more alert but still remained AOx1.
Infectious workup was negative throughout his course; he remained afebrile, blood cx/ucx were negative, and he never developed a leukocytosis or penia.
It is unclear why this culture was performed, as he had no signs of infection throughout his course.
2 CXR after this sample was obtained were negative for infiltration; the pt never developed a fever or leukocytosis.
After his hematoma evacuation, he was restarted on coumadin 2.5 by the ortho team.
It is important that he be above 2.5 for his valve, and be less than 3.5 as his risk of bleeding and hematoma development in the wound site would be quite high.
On admission, his citalopram was held due to his AMS and citalopram's interaction with his selegiline.
No episodes of hypotension during this admission.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right femoral neck fracture Right hip wound hematoma post operative blood loss anemia post operative fluid volume deficit   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted for confusion and found during your workup to have a right hip fracture which was repaired by orthopedic surgery on [**7-26**].
After the operation, you had bleeding into the surgical site, which required a return trip to the OR for drainage.
Afterwards, you had a wound vacuum placed over the incision to help facilitate healing which was removed prior to discharge.
You also had continued confusion during your hospital course that was originally due to your hip fracture, and afterwards was due to the anesthesia from your operations; this is common.
This will likely have to be changed in the future, but your dose was lowered due to the risk for further bleeding into your operation.
-Elevate right/left arm/leg to reduce swelling and pain.
