No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
No pericardial effusion.
Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded (the basal and mid inferior and inferolateral segments may be mildly hypokinetic).
Heterogeneous collection with foci of air, which could be a hematoma or developing abscess, should be closely followed.
Minimally improved multifocal peribronchial and peripheral ground-glass opacity, likely due to residual bronchiolitis, could be inflammatory or infectious.
Emphysema and signs of small airway disease.
Small pericardial and left pleural effusion with dependent atelectasis.
Moderate aortic calcifications.
4/9/090 ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Well-seated prosthetic aortic valve without regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
[**2117-4-7**] Chest X-Ray Small left pleural effusion, no other changes.
Brief Hospital Course: Admitted evaluation of sternal drainage.
Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation was held due to his elevated INR.
A CT scan was obtained which revealed an anterior mediastinal small fluid collection with displacement of his sternal wires.
The plastic surgery service was consulted  for assistance who felt he would be a good candidate for sternal plating.
Given his persistent atrial fibrillation, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which confirmed no left atrial thrombus.
On [**2117-4-3**], the plastic surgery service took him to the operating room where he underwent sternal debridement, followed by sternal plating with four Synthes plates and bilateral pectoralis musculocutaneous flap.
Intraoperatively he was noted to have complete collapse of the left lung.
Chest tube was placed and then thoracic surgery service performed a bronchoscopy for left upper lobe collapse.
