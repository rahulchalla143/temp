Admission Date:  [**2152-3-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2152-4-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2077-1-9**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit, Green Team  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female with a history type 2 diabetes mellitus (on oral hypoglycemics) and a 3-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2151-9-20**] who was admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2152-3-25**] with a 4-day history of nausea, mild emesis, and a cough productive of clear white sputum.
She also complained of abdominal pain over those preceding days which was not clearly defined by her son who was giving most of the medical history.
On the night prior to admission, she developed worsening shortness of breath and a question of chest pain.
She originally presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital where she was hypertensive at 220/120, and tachycardic to 110, with a respiratory rate of 40, and an oxygen saturation of 87%.
She was treated for congestive heart failure with diuretics without a good response.
She progressively deteriorated, requiring intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus; on oral hypoglycemics, none of which were changed prior to admission.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass graft times three in [**2151-9-20**].
No history of significant renal insufficiency (per her primary care doctor).
ALLERGIES:  She had no known drug allergies.
Her lung examination revealed rales laterally.
Her abdomen was soft with decreased bowel sounds.
The abdomen was nontender and nondistended.
Her rectal examination revealed guaiac-negative stool in the vault with no mass.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient's entire hospital course was in the Intensive Care Unit where she was being treated for pancreatitis, hypoxic respiratory failure (felt to be secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome), renal failure, and hypoglycemia.
HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  This started at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, and she continued to progress with worsening failure despite aggressive ventilatory support.
She required increasing levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and progressive bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray.
She underwent a thoracentesis on [**2152-4-5**]; removing 800 cc of transudative fluid without any improvement in her respiratory status.
It was the acute respiratory distress syndrome was felt to be secondary to her pancreatitis that caused her eventual demise.
She had no stones.
She was covered empirically with antibiotics and received computed tomography scans during her hospitalization at the time of fevers which revealed no drainable fluid collections.
RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's renal failure was felt to be secondary to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of relative hypotension that she experienced right after presenting to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.
She did have an intermediate syndrome revealing a FENa of less than 1%.
HYPOGLYCEMIC ISSUES:  Her hospital course was complicated by hypoglycemia which was felt to be secondary to persistent sulfonylurea affect in the setting of her acute renal failure.
The patient's Intensive Care Unit course was long with persistent hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome which precluded any possibility for meaningful recovery.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Renal failure.
Coronary artery disease.
