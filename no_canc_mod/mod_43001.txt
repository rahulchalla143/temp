Admission Date:  [**2112-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-3-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-1-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine Sulfate / Pronestyl / Quinidine-Quinine Analogues / Mexiletine / Captopril / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Latex / Nitrofurantoin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: progressive dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right heart cath PICC placement  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 111334**] is a 56 year old woman with a history of severe dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of [**10-24**]% (?viral vs post-partum) s/p ICD placement who was admitted on [**2112-2-23**] for severe shortness of breath and PND, presumably due to worsening congestive heart failure.
Given the lack of edema or hypoxia, the patient was continued on her home regimen fo torsemide 30mg PO QAM and 10mg PO QPM.
Notable findings during her stay included a BNP >4000 (baseline of 1000), trigger for severe dyspnea/orthopnea, and an echo that showed profoundly worsened EF now down to 5% from 10-15%, with severe dilation of the LV.
RHC revealed markedly elevated left and right heart filling pressures that significantly improved with milrinone infusion.
If this milrinone trial fails, she would likely be transferred to [**Hospital1 3278**] for a heart transplant evaluation.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

There was severe pulmonary hypertension with a PA pressure of 71/41mmHg.
Severe right- and left-sided heart failure with elevated filling pressures at rest.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
AT LEAST moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared to the prior study of [**2111-4-20**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is even further reduced, and now severe right ventricular contractile dysfunction is present, with markedly increased tricuspid regurgitation and at least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
LENIs ([**2112-2-24**]): Normal appearance of the deep venous structures of the right and left lower extremities.
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
The size of the cardiac silhouette is still substantially enlarged and the presence of a small pleural effusion on the left cannot be excluded.
Otherwise, there are signs of minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema with no evidence of pneumonia.
Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC.
Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2112-2-26**]  10:29:02 AM Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature depolarizations.

She was started on milrinone drip and had improvement in symptoms and functional capacity in-house.
Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient presented with severe dypspnea/orthopnea.
Her EF was found to be 5%, BNP elevated to 4000 from baseline of 1000, and left and right sided pressures were markedly elevated (40s and 70s systolic respectively) on right cath performed on admission.
She was transferred back to the floor, where PT eval on milrinone showed asymptomatic during ADL's and even climbing stairs.
# ARRYTHMIA: Patient went into multifocal ATach on HD#4 likely [**2-11**] discontinuation of her beta blocker after initiation of milrinone.
# Left wrist Superficial Thrombophlebitis: Patient developed superficial thrombophelbitis of left wrist since peripheral line removal in the ICU.
There was a superficial 3x3cm area of erythema, warmth, and tenderness to palpation with a palpable cord on the lateral aspect of patient's left wrist.
This initally improved with warm packs and elevation alone, but then developed increasing erythema, tenderness, and induration.
H/O LYME DISEASE, FUNGAL INFECTIONS: Per patient report, she has history of chronic Lyme disease for which she is followed by integrative medicine specialist at an OSH.
Per ID consult, no further workup needed at this time as these issues are unlikely related to her chronic heart failure.
ABNORMAL LFTs: Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.
Iron studies and hepatitis viral studies WNL.
DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Patient endorsed depression and SI without a plan in the ED.
She underwent psych eval in CCU where she was found to be mildly delirious and it was recommended that home benzos be limited.
ASTHMA: Patient has a remote history of asthma and is on prn ipratropium at home.
