[**2191-10-26**] EGD and Colonoscopy [**2191-10-28**] Capsule study   History of Present Illness: This is a 73 year old female with rheumatic heart disease and history of coronary artery disease.
Since that time, she has undergone PCI of the right coronary artery with placement of DES in [**2188**] for recurrent angina.
Recently in [**2191-9-11**], she presented to outside hospital with chest pain and ruled in for a small NSTEMI.
Echocardiogram at that time was notable for aortic stenosis.
Left Ventriculograhpy showed an LVEF of 50% without mitral regurgitation through the mechanical MVR.
Coronary angiography showed total occlusion of LAD, 60% lesion in the distal circumflex and patent stents in the RCA.
Right and left heart catheterization demonstrated critical aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.5cm2 and mean gradient of 37mmHg.
The mean PA pressure was 30mmHg and cardiac output was 3.2l/min very consistent with congestive heart failure.

The pulmonary edema has been improved being now mild.
The bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Improvement in pulmonary edema, now being of mild degree.
Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Slight T wave inversions in leads I, aVL and V4-V6 suggest possible anterolateral ischemia.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No left ventricular aneurysm is seen.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2) Mild to moderate ([**12-13**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Asingle tilting disk mitral valve prosthesis is present.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS (on milrinone): Mild LV global dysfunction.
A bileaflet aortic prosthesis visualized,well seated and no periprosthetic leaks seen.
The images are poor due to acoustic shadowing .
She remained on Heparin with no clinical signs of active GI bleed.
She was started on Ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection.
Given her recent history of massive GI bleed and known AV malformations, the GI service was consulted to evaluate for any potential sources of bleeding prior to heparinization with cardiopulmonary bypass.
EGD found two polypoid lesions in the stomach adjacent to the GE junction.
The diverticulosis appeared mild in severity.
Evaluation showed no overt signs of aspiration but silent aspiration could not be ruled out.
