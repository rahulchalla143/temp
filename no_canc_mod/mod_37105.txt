Admission Date:  [**2158-3-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-4-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-8-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12174**] Chief Complaint: Ascites  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Dobhoff tube placement Multiple paracenteses Colonoscopy Endoscopy Hickman line placement   History of Present Illness: 57 yo M with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C decompensated with ascites, encephalopathy, varices, and mild jaundice referred by his hepatologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for TIPS evaluation for refractory ascites.
Patient has had hepatitis C for over 30 years but over the past 2 months developed increasing ascites not responsive to escalating doses of lasix and aldactone.
Per report, last paracentesis was four days ago, he reports 'a lot of fluid removed' and was negative for SBP.
Patient denies any fevers or chills, but reports chronic abdominal pain over all of his belly (which he attributes to the ascites) and worsening shortness of breath due to fluid accumulation in this abdomen.
Denies hemoptysis or rectal bleeding.
CXR showed no focal pneumonia.
Liver attending was consulted who recommend admission to [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] with paracentesis and U/S in AM.
On the floor, patient had a run of SVT which broke spontaneously.
Patient denies any chest pain or palpitations at the time and stated he had gotten up to go to the bathroom at the time and had been 'lying down' all day.
Has never had a tachycardia before.
GI bleed, small volume hematemesis - EGD on [**2158-2-25**] with mild to moderate gastritis, 1+ nonbleeding esophageal varices and mild erosive reflux esophagitis h/o previous EtOH abuse (quit in [**1-/2158**]) PVD s/p aortobifemoral bypass graft in [**2150**]   Social History: Currently unemployed.
Family History: Mother died of pancreatic cancer  Physical Exam: Admission physical exam: VS: 97.1 117/69 94 20 96% on RA GA: elderly M AOx3, NAD HEENT: PERRLA.
+scleral icterus nad sublingual jaundice.
Pulm: CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: distended, +BS.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Patent hepatic and portal veins, with slow flow through the portal vein.
Hepatofugal flow is seen in the left portal vein.
Cirrhotic liver with moderate amount of ascites without any evidence of concerning focal lesion.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75-80%).
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline/mild bileaflet mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion .
EGD: Trace varices at the lower third of the esophagus, non-bleeding  Normal mucosa in the whole stomach Normal mucosa in the whole duodenum .
Colonoscopy: Abnormal mucosa was noted from rectum to length of colon examined.
There was erythema, friability, hyperemia and edema, consistent with ischemic colitis.
male with alcohol and hep C cirrhosis presenting for TIPS but with course complicated by end stage renal failure, GI bleed, and multisystem organ failure transitioned to comfort care and subsequently expired at 8:27 PM on [**2158-4-4**] with chief cause of death ischemic colitis (week) and secondary cause respiratory failure (minutes) with contributing causes of alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis C cirrhosis, and hepato-renal syndrome.
# EtOH/Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Child's Score of 10, class C. MELD of 18 on admission.
Decompensated with ascites, grade I varices, recent encephalopathy and mild jaundice.
Recent paracentesis 4 days prior to admission negative for SBP.
RUQ ultrasound not suggestive of Budd-Chiari.
SAAG > 2.2, so unsurprisingly suggestive of portal hypertension.
Hyponatremia was managed as below.
# Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient was admitted with a Cr of 1.8.
He gave a history of multiple recent paracenteses without albumin administration.
# Anemia: On presentation, patient was anemic with Hct 31.5, MCV = 102.
# Hyponatremia: Na on admission was 127.
Thought to be hypervolemic hyponatremia in setting of cirrhosis and hyper-[**Male First Name (un) 2083**]/high-ADH state.
# SVT: Patient with narrow-complex tachycardia on telemetry on morning after admission, asymptomatic (was standing at the time).
Returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm without intervention.
He had a repeat episode of Afib w/ RVR on [**3-27**] and again on [**3-30**] in HD.
Ischemic Bowel: On the evening of [**3-30**], the patient had the acute onset of BRBPR and altered mental status, he was transferred to the ICU.
Was intubated the morning of [**3-31**] and underwent EGD and flex-sig, which revealed ischemic colitis.
Patient evaluated by transplant surgery team, but was not felt to be surgical candidate given underlying  liver and renal disease.
He was managed conservatively with close monitor of HCT and hemodynamics, with transfusions as needed for recurrent bleeding.
Hypotension: Patient developed hypotension while in ICU, in setting of acute blood loss from ischemic colitis, sedation in setting of intubation, underlying cirrhosis, and possible sepsis in setting of ischemic colitis, leukocytosis and concern for intraabdominal process.
Patient initially on levophed for pressor support, though switched to dopamine on [**4-1**] given desire to minimize vasocontriction given ischemic bowel.
