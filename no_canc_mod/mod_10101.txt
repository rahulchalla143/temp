There was unknown loss of consciousness with the accident.
A deformity of the left hip was noted and was confirmed to be a posterior dislocation of the left hip.
After the reduction of the left hip, the patient had a decreased respiratory rate, and he was intubated for failure to protect his airway.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
HEENT:  Pupils were bilaterally 2 mm and minimally reactive after receiving narcotics.
Trachea midline.
No hemotympanum.
There were multiple facial lacerations and abrasions.
Left ear was with a small 1 cm laceration.
Right eyebrow extending to the scalp and hairline with a degloving-type injury with a 4 x 8 cm flap.
There was a left lower lip through-and-through laceration.
There was some crepitus on palpitation of the chest on the right side of the chest.
No other deformities.
No open wounds.
RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray showed no pneumothorax, right rib fractures noted, ribs [**5-10**], the mediastinum is wide.
Pelvis notable for a widened joint space between the head of the femur and the acetabulum on the left.
CT of the chest was negative except for bibasilar consolidations and right-sided rib fractures in ribs [**5-10**].
CT of the cervical spine demonstrated a left C4 posterior ring fracture and a left C4 vertebral foramen fracture.
It also demonstrated a T1 spinous process fracture.
A CT of the left hip demonstrated a left acetabular fracture.
An MRI/MRA of the neck demonstrated increased signal in the intraspinous C1 and C2 and in the posterior soft tissues posterior to the spinous processes of C3-C7.
There was no evidence of spinal cord compression.
Upon arrival, the patient was hemodynamically stable except for a sinus tachycardia in the 130s.
The injuries were notable for multiple facial lacerations, a C4 fracture, right rib fracture, T1 spinous process fracture, nasal fractures, a left acetabular fracture, a possible left anterior cruciate ligament tear.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the Plastic Surgery Team was consulted for repair of his multiple facial lacerations.
The Orthopedic Service was also consulted for his left acetabular fracture, as well as his left knee instability.
He tolerated this procedure very well and had no complications postoperatively from the surgery.
[**Name (NI) **] was consistently breathing over the ventilator and showed no signs of respiratory distress following extubation.
There was no evidence of significant hemorrhage in the patient's chest, abdomen or pelvis, or associated with his pelvic fracture.
There was also no evidence of acute withdraw or delirium tremens related to his use of alcohol.
To help observe any signs of withdraw, the patient was placed on a CIWA scale to follow for any signs of withdraw from his alcohol.
The Neurosurgery Service was also consulted regarding his spinal fractures, in particular the C4 posterior ring fracture and vertebral foramen fracture.
The Neurosurgery Team recommended a four-vessel angiogram to rule out any vessel damage.
This was performed, and there was no evidence of vessel laceration or injury.
The Orthopedic Service has recommended that he be touchdown weightbearing only on his left lower extremity, and also in conjunction with the Orthopedic Service, have recommended a hinged knee brace for his left knee ligamentous injury.
The patient has been maintained on a patient controlled anesthesia pump for his pain control, and on the day of discharge was switched to pain medication by mouth.
At the time of discharge, the patient has been competent in using the bathroom, eating a regular diet, and ambulating with touchdown weightbearing of the left lower extremity.
Left hip posterior dislocation.
Left acetabular fracture.
Right-sided rib fractures.
T1 spinous process fracture.
Ligamentous injury to the left knee.
