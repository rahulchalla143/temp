IMAGING:  CT Study Date of [**2206-2-11**] 12:34 PM FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
There is no cerebral edema or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation to suggest an acute ischemic event.
Extensive confluent hypodensities in deep white matter and periventricular distribution, most likely represent small vessel ischemic disease.
Focal hypodensities in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, likely represent remote infarcts, unchanged.
Linear hyperattenuation seen in the left occipital lobe (2:10) most likely represents laminar cortical necrosis in area of prior stroke.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well aerated.
No acute fracture is seen.
No acute intracranial process.
Extensive small vessel ischemic disease.
The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.
Mild aortic tortuosity is again noted, similar to prior.
Lung volumes are slightly diminished.
No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
IMPRESSION: Relatively stable chest x-ray examination with no acute pulmonary process noted.
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL Study Date of [**2206-2-12**] 8:33 AM FINDINGS: There is limited visualization of the liver, especially of the left hepatic lobe given the extensive bowel gas.
The imaged portion of the liver is unremarkable, without intrahepatic biliary dilatation or focal liver lesions.
No demonstrable color Doppler or waveforms were obtained in the region of the main or the intrahepatic branches of the hepatic artery, despite extensive scanning.
The abdominal aorta demonstrates moderate atherosclerotic calcification, without aneurysmal dilation.
There are no perihepatic or intrahepatic fluid collections.
There is no ascites.
No demonstrable arterial flow within the main hepatic artery and intrahepatic branches of the hepatic artery in this [**Date Range **] liver.
No focal hepatic lesions or fluid collections.
Continued thrombosis of the common hepatic artery as visualized previously on [**2198-4-17**].
Interval enlargement of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a mural thrombus.
Stenoses at the origin of bilateral renal arteries along with markedly atrophic kidneys bilaterally.
Evidence of mild fluid overload.
Overall, no significant changes are noted since the prior studies, persistent areas of high signal intensity in the subcortical white matter detected on FLAIR, likely reflecting chronic microvascular ischemic disease and global atrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad, although a small pericardial effusion cannot be exzcluded with certainty.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2206-1-30**], no obvious change but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive comparison.
Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2206-2-14**] at 5:46:17 PM No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are calcified and thickened/deformed, with probable mild stenosis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Moderate to severe (3+) eccentric aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus seen.
No ASD or PFO.
No abcesses or vegetations.
Calcific aortic valve disease with probable mild stenosis and moderate to severe regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
There appears to be a calcified plaque with narrowing of the distal left common carotid artery.
Contrast enhanced CTA of the neck would help for better assessment.An ultrasound of the carotids can also help if clinically indicated.
No interval change in the left occipital lobe hyperdensity since the earlier study of [**2206-2-11**], which represents a combination of calcification and blood products.
No other sites of intracranial hemorrhage detected.
Few tiny nonspecific ground-glass and nodular opacities scattered throughout both lungs and both lung bases.
While some of this may represent atelectasis, infection and other inflammatory processes are within the differential and clinical correlation is recommended.
The superior vena cava markedly decreases in caliber just proximal to its entry into the right atrium and possibly related to chronic atheterization.
Small fluid around the proximal endotracheal tube.
Small posterior right paratracheal soft tissue of unclear significance.
Contrast-filled bladder (presumably from CT from [**2206-2-12**]) with multiple left-sided diverticula.
Thickened bladder wall with trabeculations are suggestive of a more chronic process.
DVT with nonocclusive thrombus identified within the left brachial vein.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL SUMMARY: 62 yo male with history of HBV/HCV/EtOH cirrhosis with hepatic failure s/p liver [**Date Range **] on immunosuppression, ESRD on HD, seizure disorder, polymyositis on prednisone, recent STEMI ([**2205-12-5**]) on ASA/clopidogrel, recent large GI bleed [**1-8**] duodenal ulcer s/p clipping and injection, and recent admission for sepsis (d/c [**2206-1-30**]) admitted from rehab facility with altered mental status and elevated WBC count.
Active issues were addressed as below and he was called out of the MICU on [**2206-2-20**].
ACTIVE ISSUES:  # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/SEIZURE/EMBOLIC STROKE: Mr. [**Known lastname 2809**] had been noted by his wife to be inattentive and speaking in shorter sentences than usual for several weeks with no preciptious decline in mental status (subacute course).
He had an EEG on his prior admission [**2205-1-28**] which showed non-specific slowing but no epileptiform activity or focal slowing.
The initial differential for his altered mental status was broad and included infectious process (given markedly elevated WBC count and immunosupprsion), liver disease (given elevated LFTs), and neurological impairment.
He then had an apparent generalised tonic clonic seizure after 45 minutes on dialysis [**2206-2-12**] which was proceeded by a 1 minute episode of VT at 200/min for which he was unresponsive and received 2 chest compressions before waking up.
Of note, he had a prior seizure disorder though no episodes since [**2200**]; he had been on oxcarbazepine as prophylaxis.
After he was noted to have seizure during HD on [**2206-2-12**], post-ictal state from unobserved seizure was also in the differential for his altered mental status on initial presentation.
Further work up was undertaken and included LP (initially unobtainable at bedside; patient was ultimately intubated for this and other procedures and LP was performed by IR; CSF was notable only for elevated protein to 178; cultures were negative), MRI (which revealed multiple embolic infarcts as per report above); EEG (consistent with encephalopathy, no seizure activity documented); and CT scan to evaluate area of hyperdensity in occipital lobe concerning for progression of old bleed.
Tacrolimus toxicity/PRES was considered as a possible etiology of symptoms, but MRI was not consistent with that diagnosis (instead revealed embolic strokes).
Embolic stroke work up included echo with bubble study (negative) and MRI/MRA of neck demonstrating calcified plaque with narrowing of the distal left common carotid artery.
He was initially placed on heparin gtt where he was frequently supratherapeutic given his ESRD; this was stopped in the setting of Hct to 27 (from 40 on admission) and concern for expansion of old/subacute bleed in occipital region on imaging.
Following extubation the patient was noted to be awake but was not speaking except for rare one-word responses.
As the patient was transitioned to CMO care, the decision was made that the patient is allowed to eat for comfort despite having failed speech and swallow evaluation.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Following his seizure, the patient developed a troponin leak to a peak of 1.32.
He did not have significant EKG changes during this time.
Subsequent echocardiogram showed preserved EF with no major new wall motion abnormalities.
He was continued on his home aspirin/Plavix and was started on heparin gtt shortly thereafter, though this was cheifly for treatment of his embolic strokes.
He did not complain of active chest pain.
# HYPOTENSION: On [**2206-2-15**], patient became acutely hypotensive to SBP in 70s.
He had no localizing symptoms.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and Zosyn, pancultured, and started on pressors for pressure support.
There were no significant EKG changes.
The cardiology fellow was consulted by telephone, but given the normal echocardiogram, absence of EKG changes, and CVP of 6 he felt the overall clinical picture was inconsistent with cardiogenic shock.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient was noted to have elevated WBC count to 18K on admission which peaked at 21K following seizure.
However, just prior to his planned extubation, he developed the episode of hypotension as above.
He remained intubated until his blood pressures recovered.
# LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY DVT: Patient was noted to have left upper extremity swelling.
He had been anticoagulated for several days on heparin gtt for embolic stroke, but anticoagulation was held over concern for possible enlarging area of bleed in occipital region on head CT.  # ELEVATED LFTs, S/P LIVER [**Date Range **]: [**Date Range 1326**] was in [**2194**] and patient has generally done well since that time (initially for HBV, HCV, ETOH cirrhosis).
Differential for these values included reactivation of hepatitis virus (known HBV, HCV+) or graft rejection.
The patient was initially started on lactulose but this was held when he developed diarrhea (C. difficile negative) as hepatic cause of his encephalopathy was felt less likely given his laboratory profile.
He was continued on Cellcept and steroids throughout this admission, though tacrolimus was held from [**2206-2-12**] through [**2206-2-19**] given possibility of contribution to his neurologic presentation.
# VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA: Patient was noted by his nurse to have a run of ventricular tachycardia during his dailysis session on [**2206-2-12**] immediately preceding his seizure.
He was monitored on telemetry during his ICU stay with no further events.
# ESRD: Hemodialysis initiated in [**2205-11-6**].
Renal failure thought possibly due to tacrolimus toxicity, but tacro was restarted on HD.
# HYPERTENSION: Patient was periodically hypertensive during his ICU stay to SBP > 200s.
# DIABETES MELLITUS: He was treated with a HISS while in house.
# NUTRITION: During intubation, an OGT was placed and the patient was started on tube feeds.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 31427**] House (Hospice Home) - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Stroke, seizure disorder, Coronary Artery Disease, End Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis, Hepatitis B / Hepatitis C / EtOH Cirrhosis status-post Liver [**Hospital1 1326**], Polymyositis     Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 2809**] was admitted to the hospital with altered mental status, confusion and low blood pressure.
He was also found to have had a seizure during hemodialysis associated with a possible episode of ventricular tachycardia.
He was transfered to the medical intensive care unit and intubated for a short period of time.
There it was  discovered that he had experienced a stroke and also that he had a blood clot in his left upper extremity.
We also found persistent clot in his hepatic artery.
