HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 70-year-old female with a history of scleroderma, osteoarthritis, dermatomyositis who was admitted to an outside hospital back on [**2-24**] with inability to walk and low back pain, mild fevers, and questionable stool incontinence in the setting of colchicine.
The primary medical team at that point was concerned for epidural abscess, however, the neurological examination at that time did not clearly demonstrate evidence for abscess, and MR of the spine was reported negative for abscess.
However, this MR showed L3-L4 cord compression and was seen by Neurosurgery at the outside hospital, which commented that they felt that this was a diffuse process and nonfocal, and recommended following up with Rheumatology.
She was also scheduled to get a bone scan, but at that time was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation and was sent to the CCU.
Scleroderma with interstitial lung disease.
History of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter since [**10-21**].
Congestive heart failure with intact ejection fraction.
Hypothyroidism status post thyroidectomy.
Coccydynia status post injection.
Status post left medial meniscus tear.
Chronic low back pain status post laminectomy.
HEENT: anicteric sclerae.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention and supple.
Lung examination:  Scattered crackles throughout the lung fields, no wheezes.
Extremities:  Sclerodactyly with a swollen left fourth digit.
No focal deficits.
Back with positive spinal tenderness at L2-L3.
Back pain:  Patient was noted to be disoriented which was felt secondary to excessive narcotics.
Her narcotics were discontinued with the resolution in her mental status.
A Neurology consult was obtained for further evaluation of the questionable L3-L4 cord compression seen at the outside hospital MRI scan.
Repeat MR [**First Name (Titles) 7837**] [**Last Name (Titles) 14796**] degenerative and postoperative changes most prominent in the lower lumbar spine as well as impingement on the exiting left L3 root.
There was notable mild disk bulging in the lumbar spine as well as osseous effusion of the vertebral bodies with Grade I anterolisthesis of L5 upon S1.
The Neurology Service felt that this compression of L3-L4 was a chronic process and not consistent with her intact neurological examination.
This MRI revealed mild microvascular changes in the cerebral white matter, but no evidence of recent infarct.
The back pain did not improve throughout her admission.
A sacrococcygeal steroid injection was performed with improvement of her low back pain approximately 48-72 hours later with increase in her daily activities and increased ambulation as well as significant improvement in her Physical Therapy.
She will be discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility for further physical therapy sessions and will only have Tylenol with codeine as her only narcotic which seemed to minimize her mental status changes.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  The patient was admitted in normal sinus rhythm, however, during her hospital course, she reverted back to atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of approximately 100-150 beats per minute.
Flecainide 100 mg po q12h was started, but was not successful with chemical cardioversion.
Scleroderma:  The patient was admitted with IV steroids for her scleroderma.
They recommended following a hand x-ray to further evaluate the swelling of the left fourth digit which revealed extensive soft tissue calcifications, joint space narrowing, sclerosis, and subluxations in the DIP and PIP joints consistent with scleroderma.
She is to followup with her rheumatologist once discharged from her acute rehabilitation facility.
FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  She was to followup with her primary care physician and her rheumatologist, as well as her cardiologist upon discharge to her acute rehab facility.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Chronic back pain secondary to spondylolisthesis.
Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 14798**] developed progressive dyspnea requiring MICU transfer on [**2177-3-18**], with rapid progression to respiratory failure and intubation.
was determined to have diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; scleroderma renal crisis; systemic fungemia; and progressive acidosis eventually leading to her demise.
Please refer to the separate MICU discharge summary for details of her protracted MICU course.
