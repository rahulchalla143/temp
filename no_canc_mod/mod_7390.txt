Admission Date:  [**2145-8-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-8-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-12-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain, Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization  History of Present Illness: 49 year-old man with HTN, Dyslipidemia and CAD s/p MI in [**2141**], managed with PCI following failed thrombolysis, CPK peak of 3500 with ejection fraction of 41% presents today at wife's insistence with intermittent shortness of breath and vague substernal chest pressure for the past 3 weeks.
Patient states the symptoms are not related to exertion, and resolve without intervention within 20-30 seconds.
Patient also has SOB daily, most of the time in the evening upon lying down for bed.
The SOB and chest pain are not related temporally.
Patient believes the shortness of breath is related to his increased abdominal girth from weight gain of 22lbs over the past year.
Of note, patient had a nuclear stress test [**2145-7-23**], which showed fixed as well as moderately reversible defects (probably unchanged from [**2141**]).
Patient was asymptomatic at this time, and was given 325mg Aspirin.
EKG was obtained and was concerning for new twi in anterior leads; troponin < 0.01 with normal CKMB.
ROS: Notable for increased fatigue over past year and 2 weeks of intermittent headaches, which patient states are related to eye strain and increased stress.
This was associated with fever of 100, extreme fatigue and myalgias.
He denies any nausea, vomiting, diuresis, pleuritic chest pain, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools, fevers, chills, rigors or nightsweats.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC HISTORY: Anterior MI [**2141-8-9**] CHF since MI with initial EF 25%.
Recent stress MIBI with LVEF 41%.
Many (>10) cousins and extended family members with CAD and sudden cardiac death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
CHEST: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No TTP over costochondral articulations.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to apical anteroseptal akinesis and apical akinesis/dyskinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  40% to 45%  >= 55% Cath: BRIEF HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname 31693**] is a 49 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction in [**2141**].
In [**2141**] the patient had a Cypher DES placed in his proximal RCA (3.5 x 18mm) and a Cypher DES placed in his mid LAD (3.0 x 28mm).
Now coming in with unstable angina and subsequently referred for cardiac catheterization.

Upon exchanged for a 6 French sheath, the patient developed a vagal episode with decrease in SBP to 75 mmHg and HR to 49 bpm, requiring 2 mg of IV Atropine, IV fluid, and Dopamine in escalating doses up to 20 mcg/kg/min with good response.
A Prowater wire crossed the lesion without difficulty.
We directly stented with a 3.0x8 mm Cypher DES at 16 ATM.
Interim angiography showed a lesion at the proximal edge of the stent which we also directly stented with another overlapping 3.0x8 mm Cypher DES.
Final angiography showed 0% residual stenosis with TIMI 3 flow and no dissection or distal emboli.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
The LAD had no angiographically apparent disease.
The Cx had mild luminal narrowing throughout the vessel but no angiographically prominent stenosis.
The RCA had a filling defect on angiography and a plaque rupture that was apparent in the distal mid RCA.
2- Central aortic pressure was 105/67 mmHg 3- Sucecssful direct stenting of a distal RCA lesion (fiolling defect with plaque rupture) with two overlapping 3.0x8 mm Cypher stents.
Brief Hospital Course: 49M with HTN and CAD s/p MI in [**2141**] with PCI of LAD and RCA, and CHF with LVEF 41% presents today at wife's insistence with 3 week history of intermittent shortness of breath and vague substernal chest pain.
# CHEST PAIN: History of progressive, worsening chest pain and shortness of breath in a patient with significant CAD and past MI highly concerning for unstable angina.
Patient had a recent stress MIBI ([**2145-7-23**]) that did not showed stable wall motion abnormalities with one small area of reversible ischemia that was also stable from prior.
He had no furher episodes of chest pain and therefore was not started on heparin gtt.
His groin site was monitored and he had no evidence of hematoma, AV fistual and DP pulses were 2+.
# Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Patient with history of CHF following MI in [**2141**].
No evidence of acute exaccerbation on exam.
# HTN: Continued on outpatient regimen of Carvedilol and Lisinopril.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tab Sublingual as needed as needed for chest pain: may repeat up to three times every 5 minutes until chest pain resolves.
Unstable Angina 2.
Dyslipidemia 3.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable; s/p placement of cypher DES x2 to distal RCA.
Discharge Instructions: You were seen and evaluated at the [**Hospital1 18**] for chest pain and shortness of breath.
Cardiac catheterization showed a filling defect and disrupted vessel wall integrity suggestive of unstable plaque rupture in your right coronary artery.
Two overlapping stents were placed along this area to prevent further generation of clot and future occlusion of this vessel.
You had a vagal episode in the cath lab that required a short stay in the ICU for monitoring.
It is very important that you continue your aspirin and plavix following placement of this stent to prevent clot formation within the stent.
If you develop lightheadedness, fever greater than 101F, chest pain, shortness of breath, bleeding at your catheter site, significant pain or increased bruising at the catheter site, or if you at any time become concerned about your health please contact your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Hospital1 18**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31694**] or present to the nearest ED.
