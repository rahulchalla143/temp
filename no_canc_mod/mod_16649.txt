Admission Date:  [**2191-3-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2191-3-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2165-2-17**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 26-year-old male previously healthy who in [**2190-11-2**] developed the sudden onset of atrial fibrillation.
He has apparently been in persistent atrial fibrillation from [**Month (only) 359**] until now.
He was successfully converted to again went into atrial fibrillation on [**2191-3-11**].
He also received two doses of 1 mg of Ibutilide with no effect.
However, during the procedure, a small amount of loculated pericardial effusion was seen.
He denied currently feeling any lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath.
FAMILY HISTORY:  His father apparently has atrial fibrillation and had it for many years.
He has no history of sudden death or coronary artery disease in the family.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is originally from [**Location (un) 45715**] and is studying Computer Science at BU and does not smoke or consume alcohol.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No nausea, vomiting, headache, syncope, hot or cold intolerance.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to penicillin.
Additionally, he appears to have significant side effects to beta blockers and flecainide with no true allergic reaction.
General:  He was a pleasant, comfortable male in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular: Tachycardiac, irregularly/irregular, S1, S2, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Groin:  No hematoma, bruit, or oozing.
LABORATORY DATA/STUDIES:  The EKG showed atrial fibrillation with heart rate about 90, normal axis.
Echocardiogram upon arrival to the Coronary Care Unit revealed a normal left atrium and normal left ventricle, EF about 60% and very trivial pericardial effusion with no tamponade.
He had no episodes of hypotension and his atrial fibrillation was controlled with Diltiazem.
It appears that the patient was shocked into normal sinus rhythm during the procedure but upon arrival in the CCU he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation.
He remained in atrial fibrillation for his whole stay and was completely asymptomatic.
It was decided not to anticoagulate him given his young age and lower risk factors but rather use aspirin.
Additionally, a PPD will be placed and a chest x-ray obtained to rule out the possibility of a tuberculosis infection may be implicated in the pericardial effusion.
