The patient had a prolonged ventilatory wean and was tracheostomy dependent and had a gastrostomy tube placed.
The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus.
The patient developed acute renal failure, status post her ventricular fibrillation arrest and has current end stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis.
The patient had a living related renal transplant in [**2185**], with graft failure in [**2188-10-20**], again during the ventricular arrest.
The patient is status post cerebrovascular accident and has a depressed ejection fraction.
The patient has a history of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and aseptic thrombophlebitis.
The patient has a history of chronic colonization of pseudomonas in her sputum.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, end stage renal disease, who was recently discharged on [**2188-11-25**], to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.
She was doing well until five days prior to admission when she began having left lower quadrant abdominal pain and epigastric pain.
She stated that the pain was constant for five days but slowly increased.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 97.0, blood pressure 181/63.
Chest had crackles at the bases.
She had mild epigastric tenderness with left lower quadrant tenderness without any frank rebound or guarding.
She had pitting edema in her extremities.
KUB was performed which demonstrated no obstruction and that she was full of stool.
IMPRESSION:  The initial impression was that this was a 61 year old female with long medical history as stated who had abdominal pain which was quite concerning.
She had no guarding and she had no rebound.
She was discharged to rehabilitation on 60 mg of steroids, who presented with abdominal pain and tenderness on examination.
CAT scan showed free abdominal air.
At this point, it was found that the gastrostomy tube had eroded through her stomach and was freely floating in her abdominal cavity.
The patient developed progressive multisystem organ failure despite the institution of CVPHD to manage her dialysis needs as well as her fluid status.
She developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and she was placed on Amiodarone.
She developed large pleural effusions which were tapped and she had a chest tube placed to drain large pleural effusions.
She developed progressive hypotension requiring multiple pressors and she required progressive and increasing amounts of ventilatory support including high dose FIO2.
She also developed recurrent herpes infection which she had previously.
However, despite our maximum care including multiple pressors, CVPHD, multiple broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics and despite pulmonary consultations and infectious disease consultation, the patient did not make any progress and progressed with multisystem organ dysfunction and multisystem organ failure despite being on Vancomycin, Imipenem, Acyclovir, having multiple line tips cultured and being pancultured.
The patient had a repeat CT scan that did not demonstrate any focal abdominal collections or any abscesses.
