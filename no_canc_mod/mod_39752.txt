Compared to the previous tracing of [**2181-8-15**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
B. ECHO ([**2184-3-29**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (AoVA <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Borderline dilated left ventricular cavity size with moderate global hypokinesis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis is also now present.
Is the patient a candidate for surgery or CoreValve.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis.
Based on [**2179**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is symptomatic (angina, syncope, CHF) and a surgical candidate, surgical intervention has been shown to improve survival.
### Pending studies: none   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old Russian-speaking male with history of osteoarthritis s/p L hip arthroplasty in [**2165**], CAD s/p MI, critical AS non-operable due to age and comorbidities, DM2, COPD on 2L O2 at home, history of post-operative pulmonary embolism that presents principally with mechanical fall and resultant non-operative left proximal femoral periprosthetic intertrochanteric fracture.
Hospital course complicated by acute systolic heart failure likely multifactorial with large contribution secondary to excessive afterload from severe AS and flash pulmonary edema in setting of pain, constipation, and tacyhcardia.
# Left proximal femoral periprosthetic intertrochanteric fracture Patient had mechanical fall with resultant hip fracture and is unable to ambulate secondary to pain.
He was placed on standing tylenol, oxycodone 5 mg prn, and lidoderm patch for pain management, which may need to be uptitrated as he mobilizes.
On discharge, he was having minimal left hip pain.
He was started on calcium/vitamin D and outpatient empiric treatment with bisphosphonate or BMD could be considered.
Secondary issue is constipation from narcotics for which he was placed on senna, docusate, miralax, and bisacodyl.
Notably, pt has hx of prior post-operative pulmonary embolism.
# Acute systolic heart failure with flash pulmonary edema in setting of critical AS Patient was not reporting angina or syncope on admission.
Patient became hypoxemic requiring 10 L O2 on FM on [**3-27**] with flash pulmonary edema in setting of tachycardia corrected with metoprolol IV and transferred to CCU.
Pulmonary embolism, ischemia, pulmonary process ruled out with CTA showing multifocal opacities not likely representing pneumonia given clinical status.
ECHO showed new acute systolic heart failure.
Exam on discharge significant for crackles at right base.
Cardiology consult felt that acute systolic heart failure was likely multifactorial with large contribution secondary to excessive afterload from severe AS.
Beta-blocker contraindicated given history of bradycardia.
Symptomatic therapy with cautious use of diuretics was recommended given patient extremely preload dependent.
# Mechanical fall: History of fall was suggestive of a mechanical fall with no red flag symptoms such as LOC, chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness.
# Right lower leg erythema Patient noted to have circumferential erythema on right lower extremity that may be early cellulitis vs. venous stasis changes.
If erythema expands beyong boundaries of marking we would suggest starting Keflex 500mg Q12 for 5 days.
# Left humeral deformity: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
Plain film suggested no definite acute fracture and posttraumatic deformity of the left humerus.
If pain persists, patient can follow-up with orthopedics surgery clinic in [**2-13**] weeks.
# Oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Patient has no signs or symptoms of acute COPD exacerbation.
Type II DM (last A1c 6.9) Patient not on any medications at home.
# Coronary artery disease No active chest pain or anginal symptoms.
He is not on a beta blocker secondary to history of bradycardia.
# GERD Continued on protonix.
# Insomnia Continued on trazodone  # Mild malnutrition Albumin 3.3 on labs.
# CONTACT: Daughter (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (5) 94554**]  # CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI  # Transition of care - monitor for constipation given pt started on narcotics for pain control - uptitration of pain regimen as patient begins to mobilize - continue lovenox 30mg [**Hospital1 **] for at least two weeks.
Notably, pt has hx of prior post-operative pulmonary embolism.
9. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
14. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
15. lidocaine 5 %(700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Sig: One (1) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Topical DAILY (Daily) as needed for left hip pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 4542**] Rehabilitation and Nursing of [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Left hip fracture, mechanical fall Secondary: critical aortic stenosis, anasarca, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes type II, mild malnutrition   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Oxygen: Home oxygen at 2 L with target saturation 87 - 93 %   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a left hip fracture in the setting of a fall.
You also had acute systolic heart failure in the setting of your heart valve problem.
START bisacodyl and miralax in addition to senna/docusate as needed for constipation START calcium and vitamin D Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
