His preoperative electrocardiogram revealed an inferior myocardial infarction and he had an echocardiogram on [**2114-4-26**], which showed an ejection fraction of 30 percent with a moderately dilated left ventricle, moderately global left ventricular hypokinesis with posterior and apical akinesis and mild mitral regurgitation.
He then had a positive stress test and underwent cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2114-6-22**], which revealed the left ventricle had no mitral regurgitation, inferior akinesis with an ejection fraction of 26 percent, left main had minor disease, left anterior descending coronary artery had 80 percent proximal lesion, left circumflex had 90 percent before obtuse marginal one with a long segment of serial lesions to 90 percent, right coronary artery was occluded in the midregion after the acute marginal.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of hypertension.
History of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Status post inferior myocardial infarction.
History of coronary artery disease.
Status post disc surgery.

ALLERGIES:  He is allergic to Sulfa.
REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  Significant for nocturia.

Left leg has mild varicosities.
He continued to have a stable postoperative course except on postoperative day number seven when he had some bradycardia and at which time he was seen by electrophysiology who felt he had blocked premature atrial contractions.
His Lopressor was discontinued and because of his low ejection fraction, they recommended that he have an echocardiogram in one month and then follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Peripheral vascular disease.
