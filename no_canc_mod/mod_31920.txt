She presented with shortness of breath and found to be in congestive heart failure.
Cardiac catheterization revealed a 60% LAD lesion just after the first diagonal branch, a 100% stenosis of the RCA with faint bridging collaterals, severely elevated LVEDP of 35 mmHg, severe anterolateral hypokinesis, apical dyskinesis, diaphragmatic and posterobasal akinesis.
She was noted to have severely depressed global left ventricular function with an EF of 30%.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2140-12-18**] for evaluation of her coronary disease and possible stenting.
Prior to catheterization she was noted to continue to have a decreased H/H and instead underwent colonoscopy which revealed a colon mass.
Revascularization of her coronary lesions was deferred until the mass was resected and she underwent a transverse colectomy for colon cancer on [**2140-2-12**].

There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen with a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg.
The posterior mitral leaflet is slightly restricted.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Mild mitral regurgitation present.
On POD 2 the patient was noted to have a new left facial droop.
CT revealed an acute infarct of the subcortical area.
