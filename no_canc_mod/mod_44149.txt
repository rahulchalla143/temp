She remained intubated for three days after surgery secondary to a difficult airway and fluid overload.
She was fed via a dobhoff tube after surgery secondary to somnolence.
She had intermitant episodes of atrial fibrillation with hypotension and was returned to the surgical intensive care unit, where she converted to sinus rhythm after adjustment of Bblockers and initiation of amiodarone.
Her mediastinal incision was noted to have some purulent drainage and she was started on Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.
