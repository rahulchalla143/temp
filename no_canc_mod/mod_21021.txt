Mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
No evidence of pneumonia or overt CHF.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
[**2116-10-24**] CXR Lungs are mildly hyperinflated.
Heart is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged.
Mild prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissues likely reflects vascular ectasia in someone of this age.
No CHF, infiltrate, or effusion is identified.
Subsegmental atelectasis or scarring is present at both bases.
There is more atelectasis at the base of the left lung, but no change in tiny left pleural effusion or any indication of pneumothorax following removal of the left pleural drain.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette has enlarged minimally, but still normal caliber.
No evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Small low attenuation is seen involving the periventricular white matter, nonspecific probably related to chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
Hyperostosis frontalis.
If there is clinical suspicion for an acute ischemic event, correlation with MRI would be helpful if clinically indicated.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] via transfer from [**Hospital1 62664**] center on [**2116-10-22**] for surgical management of her coronary artery disease.
She underwent routine pre-operative work-up which included a carotid u/s and echocardiogram.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was stable on medical management and her surgery was delayed secondary to bed availability.
remained intubated through operative day one secondary to mild metabolic acidosis.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] developed several runs of ventricular tachycardia and Amiodarone was started.
She also had elevated blood pressure which required nitroglycerin which was ultimately weaned off without difficulty.
On postoperative day seven, Ms. [**Known lastname **] became acutely confused.
This revealed several areas of old lacuna infarcts but no new acute infarcts or  hemorrhages.
