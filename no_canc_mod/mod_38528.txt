Coli).
He was resuscitated in ICU while receiving zosyn, with marked improvement.
# Urosepsis: Patient presented with fever >104, WBC <2,000, RR 26, HR 120, (+)UA, MS changes and lactate of 7 meeting criteria for severe sepsis.
Regarding prophylaxis, this patient needs more extensive services at home to prevent recurrent UTIs.
# Acute renal failure: Patient presented with Cr 1.3 from a baseline of 0.8.
This likely represents pre-renal azotemia in the setting of sepsis and hypovolemia.
It was deemed an unlikely source of infection given history of UTIs and (+) UA.
Plain radiographs did not show any evidence of osteomyelitis.
# Multiple sclerosis.
The patient endorsed stiffness and spasticity consistent with his recent baseline.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Lidocaine HCl 2 % Gel Sig: One (1) Appl Mucous membrane PRN (as needed) as needed for Self-catheterization.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
On arrival to the emergency room you were found to have evidence of active infection including high fevers, a rapid pulse, and fast respiratory rate.
Labs showed infection in your bladder and in your blood, along with evidence of some kidney injury.
Within 24 hours, your symptoms were largely resolved and your kidney function had normalized.
As your blood infection requires additional intravenous antibiotics, we placed a PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter).
Bisacodyl and senna are also included in your discharge medications; you can request these as required for constipation.
