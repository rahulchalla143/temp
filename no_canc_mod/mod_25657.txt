History of Present Illness: 43M with alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatitis B who presented to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital (he was then transferred to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital) [**6-24**] with acute hepatic failure and pancreatitis (unclear of severity, lipase recorded as 108).
He then discharged himself AMA on [**6-27**] and returned on [**6-28**] with acute decompensated liver failure (MELD 41, INR incr 1.8->3.5), anemia, oliguria/acute renal failure and suspected sepsis.
He is being transferred from CH tonight due to hemoperitoneum following paracentesis.
The patient reportedly was noted to be more somnolent on [**6-29**] and underwent paracentesis on [**6-29**] (of note he also had a paracentesis on [**6-24**]) for 2.5L but no cell counts were sent and a descriptive report of the fluid was not logged (family reports fluid was non-bloody).
Family History: Brother with alcoholic cirrhosis.

[**2122-6-30**] AXR: IMPRESSION: Multiple air-filled dilated loops of small bowel without air in the colon is concerning for small bowel obstruction.
No definite flow is noted within the main portal vein.
[**2122-7-6**] RUQ Ultrasound FINDINGS: No focal liver lesion is identified.
No biliary dilatation is seen and the common duct measures 0.4 cm.
The gallbladder wall is mildly thickened, likely due to underlying liver disease.
There is a scant trace of ascites seen in the abdomen in the perihepatic space.
A small left pleural effusion is noted.
Scant trace of ascites and small left pleural effusion.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The visualized thyroid enhances homogeneously.
There is no axillary, mediastinal or hilar pathologic lymphadenopathy.
Ground-glass opacities are seen mainly peripherally with slight upper lobe preponderance.A more nodular wedge-shaped opacity is seen on the left.
There is atelectasis and superimposed consolidation in the right lower lobe.
There is no pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is periportal edema.
There is a smooth  long transition point in the proximal ileal loops proximal to which there is fecalization.
There is no free air within the abdomen.
There is a small amount of fluid adjacent to distal bowel loops on the right and proximal to the jejunal loops on the left.
There is no pathologic lymphadenopathy in the abdomen.
The ascending colon demonstrates an edematous prominent wall.
The prostate and seminal vesicles appear normal.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesion.
Degenerative changes are seen in the lower thoracic spine.
Distended small bowel with tapering long segment transition to decompressed ileum; findings are consistent with early or partial small-bowel obstruction.
Hepatomegaly with heterogeneous enhancement consistent with acute hepatitis.
Bibasilar atelectasis with probable superimposed consolidation in the right lower lobe; coexistent pneumonia cannot be excluded.
[**2122-7-13**] KUB: INDICATION: History of alcoholic cirrhosis presenting from outside hospital with hemoperitoneum, status post paracentesis and exploratory laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome, now with a large quantity of ascites draining from the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] tube and diarrhea concerning for C. diff.
Worsening abdominal pain today.
FINDINGS: Air and contrast material are seen within a distended stomach and there are multiple air-filled distended loops of small bowel, measuring up to 4.3 cm.
There is no free air in the abdomen.
IMPRESSION:  1) Multiple loops of air-filled distended small bowel along with air in the colon and rectum is most consistent with ileus.
2) No evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
There are no suspicious masses and no renal stones.
Trace free fluid is seen in the upper quadrant at the [**Location (un) **] pouch.
Urinary bladder is moderately filled with urine.
Neuro: The patient received intravenous dilaudid with good effect and adequate pain control.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout this hospitalization.
The patient's intake and output were closely monitored as his JP drain output was greater than 2 liters with ascitic fluid, and at POD 9 it started to slow down to less than one liter and the drain was pulled on POD 13.
As creatinine value was increasing, renal consult was called and in concert with the hepatology service the patient was managed for hepatorenal syndrome with the addition of IV albumin, octreotide and midodrine.
There was possible an early small bowel obstruction on the [**7-8**] CT, however the patient continued to have flatus and have daily BMs and continued lactulose and started rifaxamin.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Blood cultures have been sent throughout the hospitalization, and have always returned as no growth.
Cipro and Flagyl were continued for SBP prophylaxis.
CT scan done on [**7-8**] did not reveal any fluid collections or areas concerning for infection.
He was ambulatory on discharge without assistance.
He was begun on rifaximin while inpatient given concern for hepatic encephalopathy since the patient intermittently appeared confused.
At the time of discharge, in light of his worsening renal failure and poor overall prognosis on aggressive treatment, the patient in discussion with his family elected to be made CMO (comfort measures only).
Disp:*30 ml* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Hospice of the [**Location (un) 1121**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Alcoholic cirrhosis with hemoperitoneum and abdominal compartment syndrome Hepatorenal syndrome Acute Liver failure Acute Kidney Failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
