CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2110-12-12**] No hemodynamically significant stenosis was identified in the bilateral extracranial carotid arteries .
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2110-12-11**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No evidence of acute infarction.
No MR features of acute vascular territorial infarct.
[**12-13**] EEG IMPRESSION: Probably normal awake and drowsy EEG without focal, lateralizing, or epileptiform features seen.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2110-12-14**] No right lower extremity DVT  Brief Hospital Course: 81 year old woman with h/o htn and rheumatoid arthritis (on chronic steroids) admitted with urosepsis and found to have stress-induced cardiomyopathy (s/p cath [**12-8**]).
Found to have thrombocytopenia consistent with HIT and may have suffered a TIA  with negative head CT and MRI/MRA.
Differential diagnosis included sepsis, possible HIT I or II.
Concurrently, patient developed facial droop, ptosis, tongue deviation and right LE swelling concerning for arterial and venous thrombi.
## Neuro: Had new facial droop and tongue deviation on [**12-11**] thought be a TIA likely secondary to HIT Ab.
Head MRI/MRA was negative for acute ischemia.
Carotid doppler showed no significant stenosis.
Unclear whether facial signs were TIA or twitching so EEG was performed which was negative for epileptiform activity.
Repeat echo [**12-9**] EF 25-30% severe LV hypokinesis and LV sys fcn depression, RV sys fcn depression, no endocarditis.
# Pump: Patient with low EF in setting of sepsis.
Patient became  hypotensive again secondary to excessive diarrhea which improved with fluid boluses and resolution of her dairrhea.
Fever/Leukocytosis: Likely [**2-19**] E coli UTI and +BC GNR, has been afebrile since admission, leukocytosis may also be secondary to steroids, newly diagnosed lymphoma.
Possible LLL pna on CXR however sat'ing well on room air and asymptomatic.
Repeat U/A + for UTI & urine cxr no growth.
Patient to complete a 2 week course of levoquin until [**12-19**] urosepsis and possible LLL pneumonia.
Etiology likely secondary to septic shock, decreased PO intake and fluid resuscitation with NS.
Her 1.5 days of diarrhea likely contributed to her nongap acidosis.
Nutrition was consulted given history of decreased intake and low albumin, boost breezes with meals, zinc oxide, vitamin C for wound healing (sacral irritation) and calcium vit D supplementation for chronic steroid use.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
Lidocaine Viscous 2 % Solution Sig: 15-20 cc Mucous membrane  QACHS as needed for mouth/throat discomfort.
