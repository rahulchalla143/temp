The patient is a 66-year-old male with a long-standing history of coronary artery disease, who was admitted [**2138-12-2**] due to unstable angina with a troponin level ranging between 4.5 and 5.9.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2138-12-2**] which revealed a patent left internal mammary artery graft, occluded OM-1 and OM-2 graft, and a 90% occlusion in the in-stented segment of the PDA.
He was extubated the same day of surgery without any incidents around 6:00 p.m.  On postoperative day number one, the patient had a low-grade temperature at 100.3 in sinus rhythm at 88.
On postoperative day number two, the patient was mildly disoriented, however, calm without complaints with his pain well controlled.
He was still with a low-grade temperature of 100.1 in sinus rhythm at 88, mildly hypertensive at 170/88.
On physical examination, he had mild crackles bilaterally, otherwise his examination was benign.
The plan was just to continue monitor his mental status and pain control.
He did undergo cardiac catheterization on [**2138-12-11**] which now revealed a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal patent and a saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery with a 90% distal stenosis with a 3 by 13 mm stent with distal protection and 0% residual with normal flow.
