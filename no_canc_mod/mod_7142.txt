Admission Date:  [**2126-10-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-11-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-5-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: lower GI bleeding, fever and hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CENTRAL VENOUS LINE PLACEMENT   History of Present Illness: 58 year old woman with cryptogenic cirrhosis, followed by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2943**] [**Name (STitle) 696**], admitted on [**10-1**] with lower GI bleeding, fever and hypotension.
MICU course was complicated by intubation from [**10-2**] to [**10-16**], bouts of hypotension and oliguria in the setting of profuse bleeding requiring a total of 7U PRBC and 16U FFP.
Source of bleeding was identified as 1) Rectal varices and 2) Vaginal bleeding, felt to be in setting of flexiseal and very elevated INR.
Patient has undergone extensive workup for liver transplantation, given her very elevated MELD score (32 today).
6)Group B streptococcal infection and ARF in [**2124**].
She does not use tobacco or alcohol.
Family History: No history of liver disease or autoimmune disease  Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS: T = 98.2 Tc = 97  HR 89  BP 150/71  RR: 22 .
Significant scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
ABDOMEN: Obese, distended, normoactive bowel sounds EXTREMITIES: 3+ Pittind edema in lower extremities, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
Limited examination demonstrates an endometrial stripe measuring 1.4 cm.
If the patient is postmenopausal, this is an abnormal finding, and differential diagnosis includes endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial polyp, or endometrial carcinoma and clinical correlation with biopsy is recommended.
ECHO ([**2126-10-16**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is probably at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (although tricuspid regurgitation jet is now technically subopitmal).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-10-3**], probably at least mild pulmonary artery systolic pressures is now detected.
Bidirectional low velocity flow in a patent portal vein.
Mild-to-moderate ascites.
Other Three to four cords of rectal varices were identified.
Mostly likely cause of rectal bleeding.
Impression: Blood in the colon Three to four cords of rectal varices were identified.
Mostly likely cause of rectal bleeding.
Moderate ascites.
-[**2126-11-1**] KUB: Unchanged bowel gas pattern consistent with nonobstructive ileus.
Endometrial biopsy: Blood and very scant strips of surface endometrium with focal tubal metaplasia.
Pap: NEGATIVE FOR INTRAEPITHELIAL LESION OR MALIGNANCY .
The etiology of cirrhosis was not entirely clear, as her past workup included a mildly positive anti-smooth muscle antibody, and an isolated positive HBcAb, in the absence of surface antigen positivity.
Pre-transplant evaluation included an endometrial biopsy and pap smear that was negative for malignancy.
The donor was found to have a soft tissue infection, however, and the surgery was cancelled.
The patient remained on the medical floor for several more days, during which her MELD increased into the 40's, with persistently high bilirubin, and worsening INR/creatinine.
On [**11-7**], she was found to have blood in her oropharynx.
She also developed hyperkalemia and hypermagnesemia, which were attributed to her acute kidney injury.
Her recorded I/Os were initially consistent with net negative fluid balances, but the patient's urine output progressively worsened.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: The patient developed a leukocytosis up to 16 in the setting of prednisone therapy.
Fungal blood and urine cultures were sent, revealing no growth.
She was written for magic mouthwash, but did not require it once the NG tube was removed.
She also complained of pain over her left neck, where her central line had been placed.
CTA of the neck revealed no thrombosis, abscess or fluid collection, and there was no fluctuance to exam.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: On [**11-7**], the patient's creatinine increased abruptly from 0.8 to 1.7.
She had had underlying electrolyte abnormalities (hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia) leading up to this.
Urinalysis showed [**2-28**] granular casts.
Her urine output also decreased significant, and she was olguric at time of transfer to MICU on [**11-7**].
GI BLEEDING: Her initial reason for admission was GI bleed [**1-28**] portal hypertension and rectal varices.
She had small amounts of hematochezia several days prior to transfer to MICU, but hematocrit was generally stable at the time.
VAGINAL BLEEDING: TVUS concerning for thickened endometrial cancer.
Pap negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy.
Not actively bleeding .
Ganciclovir was also added for a borderline positive CMV viral load.
She tolerated her first HD session, but soon thereafter had worsening hypotension with an increasing pressor requirement.
