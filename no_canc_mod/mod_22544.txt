He returned for dialysis on [**8-25**] (the following day) where he was again found to be hypotensive and complained at that time of multiple episodes of CP on the day prior for which he had taken 6 ntg.
An EKG demonstrated AF with LVH and ST depressions with TWI in inferolateral leads, unchanged from prior EKG.
His hypotension was presumed secondary to intravascular volume depletion and plans were made for careful IVF (given history of intubation secondary to CHF), while holding BP meds for low blood pressure.
On [**8-27**], just after dialysis, he again developed left sided CP which he describes as radiating to left shoulder with SOB, relieved with nitropaste 1".

Chest pain- Not convincingly cardiac given EKG relatively unchanged from prior (possibly increased ST depression in lateral leads) and no increase in cardac enzymes despite numeraous episodes of CP over last few days.
Possibly some volume related hypoperfusion in the setting of fixed stenoses and dialysis.
If CP recurs and is difficult to control, may consider more urgently.
Will consder ablation only if unable to decrease HR with meds - continue heparin gtt with frequent neuro evals given subdural hemorrhage.

INDICATION: 82-year-old man with PVD, CAD, COPD presenting with chest pain status post spleen catheterization.
Rule out PE or dissection.
CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There are bilateral large pleural effusions, right greater than left.
There are few focal areas of ground-glass opacity within the right upper lobe.
There is associated dependent atelectasis.
There are multiple enlarged lymph nodes within the mediastinum, the majority of which are calcified, the largest measuring 11 mm in diameter within the precarinal space.
There is also calcified hilar lymphadenopathy, measuring 18 mm in diameter on the right.
There are calcified granulomas within left atelectatic lower lobe.
Bilateral pleural effusion.
CTA CHEST: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic aneurysmal dilatation within the visualized thoracic aorta.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Calcified mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy along with calcified lung granulomas consistent with chronic granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis or sarciodosis  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2174-8-30**] 11:49 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: please evaluate for SDH, other process.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN  HISTORY: Coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with history of a subdural hematoma.
Evaluate for status of subdural hemorrhage.
[**First Name (STitle) 1022**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] as showing "no evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect."
FINDINGS: There is no sign of an intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures, or visible major vascular territorial infarction.
Two probable chronic lacunar infarctions are noted within the head of the right caudate nucleus with redemonstration of a mild degree of chronic small vessel infarction in the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.
There is prominent atherosclerotic calcification involving both distal vertebral arteries as well as the basilar artery, and to a marked extent involving the cavernous portions of both internal carotid arteries.
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are notable for interval development of moderate, slightly polypoid shaped mucosal thickening involving the right maxillary antrum.
CONCLUSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 82 year old man with ESRD, COPD and pleural effusion REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Right decubitus to evaluate pleural effusion.
Pleural effusions.
Moderate volume mobile bilateral pleural effusion, stable on the left and increased on the right since [**7-9**] and [**8-28**].
Interstitial edema has almost entirely cleared since [**8-28**].
Severe left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened since [**8-28**].
No pneumothorax  Upper endoscopy: Stomach:  Mucosa: Diffuse continuous hypertrophy of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the whole stomach.
These findings are compatible with hypertrophic gastritis.
Tissue biopsy [**8-31**]: DIAGNOSIS: Stomach, mucosal biopsy:  Mild chronic inactive gastritis.
Chest pain: The patient was admitted with chest pain with EKG demonstrating possibly increased ST depression in lateral leads and troponin of .16 with no elevation in CK.
The differential diagnosis for his chest pain included cardiac ischemia due to coronary blockage vs. increased demand due to atrial fibrillation vs. volume related hypoperfusion in the setting of fixed stenoses and dialysis vs non cardiac cause.
CTA was also performed, which ruled out pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Non-cardiac causes for the patient's chest pain were explored and he underwent a EGD, which demonstrated hypertrophic gastritis.
Anticoagulation: The patient was restarted on coumadin after a CT of his brain was performed to rule out expansion of previously noted subdural hematoma.
It is likely that when the patient experienced chest pain previously, he self medicated with nitroglycerin leading to some hypotension.
His chest x-ray demonstrated some degree of atelectasis and volume overload.
Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient underwent renal dialysis according to his normal outpatient schedule while in the hospital, with removal of fluid to assist in relieving his pulmonary congestion.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.

You were found to have NO new blockage in your coronary arteries.
You should not continue to take sublingual nitrates for chest pain.
If you have chest pain, you should call your primary care physician to discuss appropriate action.
You had an endoscopy while in the hospital which showed hypertrophic gastritis.
There have been no other changes to your medication regimen.
This requires that you have your INR checked regularly and may require that you decrease or increase your dose.
