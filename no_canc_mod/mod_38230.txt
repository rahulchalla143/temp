[**2186-3-9**] Cardiac Cath  History of Present Illness: 80 year old male with a history of CHF, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation was admitted to outside hospital with shortness of breath X 3 weeks with exertion and syncope while shoveling snow.
He ruled out for myocardial infarction with negative cardiac markers.
Echocardiogram [**2186-3-8**] showed increase in aortic stenosis, with valve area 0.4cm and an EF of 55%.
He was transferred for cardiac catheterization to evaluate known aortic stensosis and for Coronary artery disease.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no angiographically significant coronary artery disease.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right atrial pressures, mild pulmonary artery hypertension, and elevated left heart filling pressures with prominant PCW v-waves (23mmHg).
On carefull pullback of the pigtail catheter from the LV apex to the ascending aorta there was no subvalvular gradient appreciated.
[**2186-3-13**] Echo: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated.
Moderate spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Moderate spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
Moderate spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a bioprosthesis located in the aortic position.
There is trace valvular aortic regurgitation.
