The patient complains of right lower extremity pain extending from the knee down to the foot.
He also noted increased fingersticks at home in the 400 to 500 range for two days prior to admission.
Review of systems at presentation was significant for no fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria or bright red blood per rectum.
The patient received stents to the left marginal for a 70% stenosis and the obtuse marginal one for a 90% stenosis.
The patient has a known left bundle branch block.
Diabetes mellitus type 2 complicated by chronic kidney disease (several episodes of acute renal failure, receiving dialysis at that time), neuropathy and retinopathy.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Magnetic resonance imaging scan at that time was negative for osteomyelitis.
History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin resistant enterococcus infections.
Left thyroid lobectomy.
General:  Alert, in no acute distress.
Neck:  Supple without lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
Extremities:  Left lower extremity below the knee amputation, no erythema or edema, right lower extremity with erythema and edema extending above the knee, status post right number one and number two toe amputations, heel ulcer healing with no drainage, beginning of skin breakdown on right shin and right foot but no drainage and no cuts/ulcers/lesions.
IMPRESSION:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old male with vasculopathy, peripheral vascular disease, status post left below the knee amputation, coronary artery bypass grafting, who was admitted with right lower extremity cellulitis complicated by Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and aspiration pneumonia.
The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, likely in the setting of demand ischemia and acute renal failure, now improved.
He has remained afebrile while on levofloxacin and clindamycin.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Emergency Room on [**2191-11-6**] with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus right lower extremity cellulitis.
A chest x-ray was clear and venous ultrasound was negative for thrombosis at that time.
An electrocardiogram showed 1 mm inferior and lateral ST depressions and his chest pain resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.
His stool remained occult blood negative.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on [**2191-11-10**] and consideration of repeat vascularization may be undertaken after the acute process resolves.
On [**2191-11-11**], the patient developed a cough and shortness of breath with mild desaturation.
On [**2191-11-12**], the patient was noted to be somnolent, with nausea and vomiting.
The patient became febrile and had a temperature that peaked at 102.9.
The Renal Service suspected acute tubular necrosis and Lasix boluses and isosorbide mononitrate were discontinued.
Throughout the evening of [**2191-11-12**], the patient continued to have rigors and soaking sweats.
He experienced several episodes of transient hypotension to the 80s and 90s systolic.
He rapidly became hypoxic around 2:00 p.m. and eventually required a 10 liter face mask.
He was noted to have poor secretion management, with a weak cough and persistent rattle without frequent suctioning.
He was noted to have cardiac enzymes that were positive and his metoprolol was decreased to 25 mg twice a day rather than discontinuing it altogether secondary to his hypotension.
He was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia at that time and was treated with renally dosed levofloxacin and clindamycin.
He was continued on aspiration precautions with the head of bed greater than 45 degrees with frequent tracheal suctioning.
Vascular Surgery was re-consulted to assess the patient's right lower extremity for possible revascularization or amputation.
They evaluated the patient and felt there was no indication for amputation or revascularization acutely.
Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Chronic kidney disease with an episode of acute renal failure, which resolved.
Peripheral vascular disease complicated by right lower extremity ulcers.
Renal artery stenosis.
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
