She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (1) 75302**]) - she had presented to an OSH [**1-3**] with confusion and headache and was found to have a NSTEMI; she was started on ASA and heparin gtt and developed aphasia.
She was transferred here, where she was found to be aphasic, with mild right hemiparesis (mild right facial, right arm drift, right leg with less brisk movement).
CT scan revealed left parietal hemorrhage consistent with hemorrhagic conversion of a left inferior MCA infarct (possibly seen on OSH head CT from [**1-3**]).
Hospitalization was notable for new onset atrial fibrillation/flutter, treated with metoprolol, UTI, treated with vancomycin, and anemia secondary to hematemesis from H pylori gastritis, treated with triple therapy.
The day of presentation, she complained of acute onset worsening of her speech and acute RUE weakness at 4:45pm (she had been able to talk w/ neologisms and walk).
Past Medical History: Left inferior MCA infarct with hemorrhagic conversion as above NSTEMI diabetes mellitus type II hypertension atrial fibrillation/flutter GIB secondary to H pylori gastritis C diff infection s/p treatment  Social History: No tobacco, EtOH, drug use.
Family History: unable to elicit, unknown on prior OMR notes   Physical Exam: T 98.3, HR 127 (improved later to 80s-100s), BP 143/85, RR 32 (improved later), SaO2 100%/NRB Genl: lying in bed, eyes mostly closed HEENT: NCAT, MMM, OP clear CV: irregularly irregular, tachycardic, nl S1, S2, no m/r/g, no bruits Chest: CTA anteriorly w/ cough Abd: soft, NTND, BS+ Ext: warm and dry  Neurologic examination: On initial examination prior to HCT, pt noted to have approximately 10 seconds of rhythmic jerking of eyebrows, spontaneously resolved.
CN: pupils equal and reactive, ?slightly decreased right eye abduction, o/w full EOM, R facial palsy, ?tongue deviated to the right vs relative deviation due to facial palsy Motor: RUE flaccid, LUE antigravity w/o drift, RLE triple flexes, LLE antigravity Sensory: responds to noxious in all but RUE Pt brought to CT scan, and on return, able to say name (only), follow commands for formal strength testing of left arm (full), and was noted to be minimally antigravity at shoulder and elbow.
However, then developed rhythmic twitching of her right face, given ativan 2mg IV after approximately 1-2 mins, with resolution after 1 min more.
After the ativan was given, exam: MS: pt was minimally responsive, able to open eyes and look to voice, following command to squeeze and let go of hand, not speaking CN: as above, +cough Motor: flaccid RUE, not moving RLE to noxious, increased tone throughout DTRs: hyperreflexic on right (r/l: [**Hospital1 **], tri, BR, 2+/2; pat 3+/2+; ach [**3-6**]+), toes equivocal b/l   Pertinent Results: [**2122-2-10**] 11:26PM URINE  HOURS-RANDOM [**2122-2-10**] 11:26PM URINE  bnzodzpn-NEG barbitrt-NEG opiates-NEG cocaine-NEG amphetmn-NEG mthdone-NEG [**2122-2-10**] 11:26PM URINE  COLOR-Yellow APPEAR-Clear SP [**Last Name (un) 155**]-1.008 [**2122-2-10**] 11:26PM URINE  BLOOD-LG NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-NEG GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-5.0 LEUK-NEG [**2122-2-10**] 11:26PM URINE  RBC-[**7-14**]* WBC-0-2 BACTERIA-NONE YEAST-NONE EPI-0-2 [**2122-2-10**] 09:45PM URINE  COLOR-Yellow APPEAR-Clear SP [**Last Name (un) 155**]-1.008 [**2122-2-10**] 09:45PM URINE  BLOOD-NEG NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-NEG GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-5.0 LEUK-NEG [**2122-2-10**] 08:59PM   PT-14.7* PTT-24.1 INR(PT)-1.3* [**2122-2-10**] 06:22PM   GLUCOSE-168* UREA N-11 CREAT-1.2* SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-3.7 CHLORIDE-105 TOTAL CO2-16* ANION GAP-23* [**2122-2-10**] 06:22PM   estGFR-Using this [**2122-2-10**] 06:22PM   ALT(SGPT)-14 AST(SGOT)-26 CK(CPK)-88 ALK PHOS-62 AMYLASE-128* TOT BILI-0.2 [**2122-2-10**] 06:22PM   LIPASE-76* [**2122-2-10**] 06:22PM   CK-MB-NotDone cTropnT-<0.01 [**2122-2-10**] 06:22PM   ALBUMIN-3.7 CALCIUM-9.1 PHOSPHATE-4.1 MAGNESIUM-1.9 [**2122-2-10**] 06:22PM   WBC-6.8 RBC-5.20 HGB-11.5* HCT-39.6 MCV-76* MCH-22.2* MCHC-29.1* RDW-16.8* [**2122-2-10**] 06:22PM   NEUTS-48* BANDS-0 LYMPHS-41 MONOS-8 EOS-2 BASOS-0 ATYPS-1* METAS-0 MYELOS-0 [**2122-2-10**] 06:22PM   HYPOCHROM-2+ ANISOCYT-1+ POIKILOCY-2+ MACROCYT-NORMAL MICROCYT-2+ POLYCHROM-1+ OVALOCYT-2+ TARGET-OCCASIONAL TEARDROP-OCCASIONAL [**2122-2-10**] 06:22PM   PLT SMR-NORMAL PLT COUNT-264  <br> IMAGING NCHCT [**2121-2-10**]: FINDINGS:  A large, wedge-shaped are of hypodensity is again identified in the left parietal region, consistent with infarction in the left MCA distribution.
There has been interval resolution of much of the hemorrhage seen previously in this distribution with some foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage remaining, consistent with evolution of hemorrhagic infarct seen on the previous exams.
The septum pellucidum et vergae is also noted.
IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with evolving hemmorhagic left MCA infarct.
No new areas of hemorrhage or edema identified.
<br>  CXR [**2121-2-10**]: SINGLE VIEW CHEST, PORTABLE ERECT:  There has been interval removal of the left-sided PICC.
There are low lung volumes and mild increased interstitial opacities bilaterally within perihilar distribution consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
The cardiac size is stable and mildly enlarged.
IMPRESSION:  Mild congestive heart failure.
Improving, but residual mild CHF.
No evidence of pneumonia.
She had no further seizure activity.
She did demonstrate some evidence of paraphasia and anomia.
Her facial palsy and tongue deviation had resolved; there was evidence of a right field cut.
There was no evidence of her right hemiparesis, and strength had returned in full.
There was evidence of ataxia and dysmetria on finger-to-nose bilaterally, but heel-knee-shin was intact bilaterally.
On laboratory evaluation in the morning after admission, there was no clear toxic, metabolic, or infectious etiology as a precipitant for the underlying seizure focus.
A drop in her hemaglobin and hematocrit was believed to be due to hemodilution, given IV fluid resuscitation and the drop in counts of all cellular elements toward her baseline values on previous admissions; there was no evidence of bleeding.
The patient should remain on anti-epileptic medication for at least 1 year given the occurrence of her seizures off dilantin.
She remained stable on her new regimen with no complications and was discharged to rehab.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
History of left MCA cerebral infarct with hemorrhagic conversion  Secondary: 1.
Hypertension 3.
Atrial fibrillation  Discharge Condition: Good condition, mild language difficulties (with naming and repetition, comprehension intact), mild right sided weakness (at least 4+/5).
She did demonstrate some evidence of paraphasia and anomia.
Her facial palsy and tongue deviation had resolved; there was evidence of a right field cut.
There was no evidence of her right hemiparesis, and strength had returned in full.
There was evidence of ataxia and dysmetria on finger-to-nose bilaterally, but heel-knee-shin was intact bilaterally.
You were restarted on the Dilantin and started on Keppra to prevent future seizures.
If you develop new symptoms such as weakness, numbness, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, dizziness, recurrent seizures, or any other symptom that is concerning to you, please call your PCP or your neurologist or go to the nearest hospital emergency department.
