Admission Date:  [**2137-9-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-9-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-6-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Cefoxitin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: VF arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Cardiac catheterization revealing minimal coronary lesions -ICD placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 53 year old female with history of seasonal allergies and sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis who presented to the ED after an out of hospital VF cardiac arrest.
She was hypotensive in the field and so was started on dopamine.
Due to a difficult airway she could not be intubated in the field and was ventilated with bag valve mask until arrival at the ED.
She proceeded immediately to the cath lab where left heart cath showed minimal atherosclerotic disease without thrombus but with catheter-induced spasm of the proximal RCA.
Right heart catheterization showed elevated right and left filling pressures.
Past Medical History: - sigmoid diverticulitis s/p sigmoidectomy - appendectomy - seasonal allergies  Social History: She does not drink or use alcohol.
Family History: Her brother has hypertension and diabetes mellitus.
No known family history of premature cardiac disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple without JVD or palpable lymphadenopathy CV: RRR, normal S1/S2, no MRG, although auscultation of heart sounds limited by transmitted breath sounds Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis; burnt looking skin around xyphoid; Respirations unlabored; no accessory muscle use; No crackles, wheeze, rhonchi appreciated Abd: Obese, soft, NT,ND; old scar below umbilicus Ext: WWP; No c/c/e; R femoral line in place w/o bleeding nor bounding pulse Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Central venous access has been removed.
There is a new ICD placed in the left upper chest causing a bulge in the skin.
There is no erythema.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had minimal plaquing.
Canulation of the RCA induced vasospasm which was only partially reversed by intracoronary nitroglycerin injection; mild ostial plaquing could not be differentiated from continued vasospasm under these circumstances.
Resting hemodynamics at entry revealed moderately elevated left ventricular filling pressures measured at 20 mmHg.
Post-angiography hemodynamics showed mild-moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension at 50/233 mmHg.
A moderate elevation of right atrial at 20 mmHg and capillary wedge pressure at 20 mmHg was noted.
There was no oxymetric evidence of significant intracardiac shunting.
Moderate left and moderate-severe right ventricular diastolic heart failure.
Mild-moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
No oxymetric evidence of significant intracardiac shunting  [**9-2**] TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence for acute intracranial process.
No CMR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
No CMR evidence of right ventricular fatty infiltration/dysplasia.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
No significant aortic, pulmonic, or tricuspid regurgitation.
Small right pleural effusion   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 53 year old female with past medical history significant only for seasonal allergies and diverticulitis s/p partial colectomy presents after out of hospital witnessed VF arrest.
She was started on dopamine for hypotension in the field.
There were no clear signs of of long QT syndrome or another ectopic trigger for VF on the EKG.
TTE on the day of admission showed EF 25% with biventricular hypokinesis, normal valves, and normal septal thickness but no signs of right heart strain.
Thus pulmonary embolus was considered a much less likely etiology of arrest and heparin was stopped on the morning after admission.
On presentation the patient had been started on a cooling protocol, which was stopped shortly after her arrival in the CCU as she had not reached goal temperature in the appropriate time window and was minimally sedated and quite active.
No clear trigger for her VF was discovered in the hospital though underlying cardiomyopathy given her decreased EF was considered the most likely etiology.
Given the patient had an out of hospital VF arrest without a clear cause the electrophysiology service was consulted and placed an ICD without complication on [**2137-9-5**].
Cardiac MRI was also obtained to look for an arrythmogenic scar or ARVD, but the results of this study weren't available at discharge.
2) Coronary artery disease: The patient had a cardiac catheterization soon after arrival, which showed no flow limiting coronary artery disease.
She was put on low dose daily aspirin during this hospitalization for primary prevention of ACS given her  cardiomyopathy and the danger of further insults.
3) Pump: TTE done shortly after arrest showed global LV dysfunction but no major structual abnormalities or local injury.
As noted above, cardiac catheterization showed no significant disease basically eliminating ischemic cardiomyopathy as a possibility.
The patient has no history of alcoholism or other toxic exposures that could cause this profound level of cardiomyopathy.
The patient never had a clear viral prodrome with fevers, chills, or sore throat, but at time of discharge the main differential for her depressed pump function was viral/idiopathic cardiomyopathy vs myocardial stunning from brief ischemia during her arrest.
The patient repeatedly denied any signs of cardiomyopathy prior to admission particularly denying decreased exercise tolerance, lower extremity edema, and dyspnea and she was never noted to have these symptoms in her hospital.
The patient did have a cardiac MRI to evaluate for subtle structural disease, but the results of this study were still pending at the time of discharge.
The patient will follow-up in cardiology for the results of her MRI as well as repeat echocardiograms and further management of her cardiac disease.
4) Neurological status: On presentation in the ED the patient was started on a cooling protocol for out of hospital cardiac arrest given her low GCS.
She also had a CT head without contrast to evaluate for acute intracranial process given the lack of a clear etiology for her collapse and concern for an acute intracranial hemorrhage.
CT was negative for acute intracranial process.
As she was quite agitated and pulling at her endotracheal tube; however, she received further sedation for her safety.
On the morning after presentation the team planned to extubate the patient, but during a spell of agitation she managed to self extubate with no notable ill effects.
By the time of discharge she was considered to be at her baseline with no detected persistent neurological deficits from her cardiac arrest.
5) Gastrointestinal bleeding: On the morning after admission the patient had hemoccult positive emesis  in the setting of supratherapeutic heparin and heaving from the ETT.
Repeat emesis was less notably bloody and after a small further drop on the day after admission serial hematocrits rematined stable around 30.
Given anemia her vitamin B12 and folate levels were checked and were normal though her reticulocyte index was mildly decreased.
6) Renal: On admission catheterized urine specimen revealed increased RBC and WBC counts with moderate bacteria.
The results of the first UA were attributed to trauma, antibiotics were discontinued, and there were no further renal issues during this hospitalization.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed: for pain because of procedure.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 3765**] Home Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventricular Fibrillation with Arrest  Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: You had a ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest.
It is unclear why you had this dangerous heart rhythm.
We did tests that showed your heart is weak, but it is unclear if this caused your cardiac arrest or is simply a result of poor blood flow to the heart during the arrest.
-Aspirin: a mild blood thinner to prevent blood clots -Tylenol: for pain because of the ICD placement -Oxycodone: a narcotic to take if the tylenol doesn't work.
-Your antihistamine (claritin or allergra) was discontinued due to possible arrhythmia inducing effects.
You had an internal defibrillator placed that will deliver a shock if you have another episode of ventricular fibrillation.
Please also call your doctor if you have trouble lying flat or develop increased shortness of breath.
Also call your doctor or come to the emergency room if you have sudden development of shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers, or any other concerning changes in your health.
