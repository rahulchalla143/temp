The pt reports that she awoke at 3:15 AM with acute shortness of breath and wheezing.
CXR showed R pleural effusion.
ROS is otherwise positive for more black stools over the past 2-3 days.
Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (3) 13475**] due to lower GI bleed and HCT of 17.
She required 6 units PRBCs that admission and bleeding was felt to be due to lower GI angioectasia; colonoscopy was not done due to recent scope [**1-30**] which showed many angioectasias throughout the colon.
She was also treated for congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute renal failure on that admission and was discharged on spironolactone, torsemide and metolazone still about 40 lbs above her dry weight.
She does recall an episode of left leg pain two days ago while trying to go up stairs and feels she may have been when she started feeling more short of breath, although the acute episode of dyspnea was not until later.
Ongoing occasional nausea, vomiting with emesis including medications at times.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.

[**Month/Day/Year **] for pulmonary edema.
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2109-2-26**] and multiple priors.
SINGLE PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: In comparison to the most recent chest radiograph as well as the recent CT, there has been an increase in a right pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Increased right and continued left pleural effusion.
[**2109-4-2**]: TTE The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
A septal occluder device is seen across the interatrial septum.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is probably significant pulmonary hypertension although this could not be adequately quantified.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
(Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.)
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-2-26**], there is no significant change.
[**2109-4-2**]: Renal Ultrasound INDICATION: Patient is a 63-year-old female with longstanding hypertension.
[**Month/Day/Year **] for renal artery stenosis.
Both kidneys are unremarkable in appearance with no evidence of hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or discrete masses.
DOPPLER EXAMINATION:  Both main renal arteries demonstrate a brisk upstroke and good diastolic flow.
This is compatible with mild to moderately elevated resistive indices.
No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Mild to moderately and symmetrically elevated resistive indices bilaterally.
[**2109-4-4**]: CHEST RADIOGRAPH  INDICATION: Chronic heart failure, shortness of breath, evaluation for interval change.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with basal areas of atelectasis and a small right-sided pleural effusion.
No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity in the lung parenchyma.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Pt presented with dyspnea and hypoxia; she was on Bipap and transitioned to NRB.
Acute onset raised concern for an inciting event, but no clear inciting factor apparent.
She did have mild leukocytosis to WBC 12 but no fevers, cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.
She is in chronic atrial fibrillation but is rate controlled.
She had no chest pain to suggest ACS; EKG was at her baseline and 2 sets of cardiac enzymes were negative.
A pulmonary embolus was considered but given no chest pain or tachycardia (on beta blocker) this was not felt to be a concern.
Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute decompensation.
According to the patient's daughter, the presentation may have actually been more subacute over several days and there may have been a component of suboptimal dietary/medication compliance in this patient with baseline diastolic CHF that has been very difficult to manage.
The hypotension was felt to be cardiogenic in the setting of worsening diastolic CHF.
There was no evidence for sepsis although the patient was found to have a UTI.
Her hematocrit did show a slight drop but blood loss and hypovolemia were not felt to be contributing to her hypotension.
# Hematochezia: The patient was recently admitted for anemia and thought to have recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding.
During this admission she continued to have guaiac positive stools but her hematocrit was relatively stable since her last discharge.
She continued taking her home pantoprazole, and sub-cutaneous heparin was avoided in the setting of her GI bleed.
# Acute renal failure: The patient was found to have BUN 100 and Cr 2.5 (baseline 1.7).
This was thought likely due to decreased renal perfusion in the setting of decompensated heart failure.
# Elevated LFTs: The patient was noted to have mild AST and Alkaline phosphate elevation with normal ALT and total bilirubin.
She had no abdominal pain and these values were felt to be due to congestive hepatopathy; they resolved with diuresis.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient remained stable with a slow ventricular response.
Her home metoprolol was held in the setting of hypotension and she was not anticoagulated given her history of significant GI bleeding.
# Diarrhea / ulcerative colitis: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2987**], the patient's gastroenterologist, was made aware of the patient's admission.
On admission, the patient had no abdominal symptoms such as pain or diarrhea, and she did not seem to be having an acute ulcerative colitis flare.
She did develop diarrhea with antibiotic treatment of her UTI that resolved when the antibiotics were stopped.
She continued taking her Asacol though had some difficulties tolerating the medication without vomiting due to the size of the pill.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure.
Secondary Acute Renal Failure ulcerative colitis Diabetes Hypertension   Discharge Condition: fully ambulatory with walker.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were having difficulty breathing.
This was due to your heart failure which also caused renal failure.
