Hypoxia: Developed after receiving sedation for procedure.
Most likely related to sedation and her poor respiratory mechanics given her ALS.
Also possibly a component of atelectasis in setting of poor respiratory effort and fatigue.
Aspiration event or infection is also in the differential given leukocytosis, however less likely as pt remained afebrile.
As pt clinically improved, leukocytosis was thought to be a stress reaction.
Chest x-ray was difficult to evaluate given no prior for comparison.
Pain was controlled with prn tylenol, oxycodone.
