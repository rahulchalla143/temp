Admission Date:  [**2192-4-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-4-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2172-8-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: CODE STROKE   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TPA administration Cerebral Angiography with balloon angioplasty Central Line placement PICC line placement Intubation OG tube NG tube  History of Present Illness: 19 yo woman with hx migraines only, nonsmoker, no ocps, presents as code stroke after being found down at 10AM not moving left side, somnolent, last known well 9:15, taken to [**Hospital1 18**] and CT with no bleed, glucose and INR "normal" now s/p TPA for superior R MCA stroke with ?clot proximal/M1.
Repeat cta following administration of IV tpa showed no recannulization of the MCA, but also no bleed.
She was taken emergently to interventional radiology for angiography and potential consideration of IA TPA; her family was notified and consented prior to this experimental procedure.
At just under the 6 hour mark, she underwent angiography with mechanical intervention with balloon to open the MCA; revascularization was obtained with balloon alone, and IA TPA was not given both because of the time restraints (at this point >6hrs) and risk associated.
Of note, the patient had apparently complained of leg pain several months back, but more details about this are unknown at this time.
She was awake at presentation and had denied smoking or ocps, as well as other medical conditions, medications or allergies.
Family history later clarified upon family's arrival to US: no blood clotting disorders, miscarriages, autoimmune disorders, or early strokes or heart attacks.

No spontaneous mvmt LUE, but withdraws with good resistance to nailbed pressure.
No obvious tremor and could not perform test for pronator drift.
Mass effect with slight displacement of the right lateral ventricle may be slightly increased compared to the previous study.
No definite evidence of acute hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: Right MCA distribution infarction with possibly slightly increased mass effect compared to the previous exam.
No definite acute hemorrhage.
SUBSEQUENT CTA BRAIN:  CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of the normally midline structures.
There is a rounded hypodense focus within the right caudate nucleus, consistent with an old lacunar infarction Vs. an old demyelinating plaque.
The left internal carotid artery opacifies normally with contrast, through its bifurcation into anterior and middle cerebral arteries on the left.
At the superior-most portion of the supraclinoid right internal carotid artery, there is either high-grade stenosis Vs. occlusion.
There is contrast within the right anterior cerebral artery proximally.
No contrast is visualized within the proximal M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery.
The findings may represent occlusion of the distal right internal carotid artery Vs. proximal right middle cerebral artery, with filling of other branches of the right middle cerebral artery from collateral vessels, Vs. high-grade stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Paucity of vessels visualized within the right superior division distribution of the right middle cerebral artery.
The findings are the manifestation of acute/evolving infarction in this territory.
Infarction may be related to occlusion Vs. extremely high-grade stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery and/or proximal right middle cerebral artery.
There is now further loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation confined to the supply territory of the right middle cerebral artery, consistent with an evolving acute infarct.
There is now further mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle and the cerebral sulci in that region.
No CT features of hemorrhagic transformation are seen at present.
Chronic encephalomalacia at the head of the right caudate nucleus is again noted.
There is reconstitution of flow noted distally within the right middle cerebral artery and its principal branches, likely retrograde flow from collaterals.
The extent of the occlusion remain unchanged from two hours ago, and there is persistent paucity of vascularity within the right middle cerebral artery supply territory more distally.
Evolving cerebral infarct confined to the territory of the right middle cerebral artery, with no CT evidence of hemorrhagic transformation at present.
For intra-arterial TPA.
TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient's family after explaining the risks, indications and alternative management.
Risks explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.
Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
The following vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms were performed from these locations:  1) Right internal carotid artery.
2) Right middle cerebral artery.
FINDINGS: Injection of the right internal carotid artery demonstrates complete occlusion of the proximal M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery, with reflux of contrast from leptomeningeal collaterals to reconstitute the distal portion of the right MCA and its branches.
CONCLUSION: Successful balloon angioplasty and re-vascularization of the occluded right middle cerebral artery.
No underlying fractures or marrow edema is seen.
There is homogeneous signal noted within the cervical cord.
No focal herniations are seen at any level.
There is no extrinsic cord compression seen.
There is diffusely abnormal increased T2 signal involving the posterior aspect of the nasopharynx and extending along the prevertebral space from C1 through C4 levels.
This could represent possible retropharyngeal hemorrhage into the prevertebral space.
IMPRESSION: No compression fractures seen involving the cervical spine.
There is T2 hyperintensity in the prevertebral soft tissues extending from the base of skull inferiorly into C4-C5 level along the prevertebral soft tissues suggestive of possible retropharyngeal hemorrhage.
This could be related to possible intubation or bleeding into the retropharyngeal space.
No cord compression was seen.
POST-ANGIO HEAD CT [**4-9**]: FINDINGS: Comparison with the prior study of [**2192-4-10**] shows no significant interval change.
There has been no overt hemorrhagic transformation.
Degree of mass effect, including slight hippocampal herniation, is unaltered.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
Once again, the component of the infarct within the head of the right caudate nucleus obliterates the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and there is a millimeter or two leftward shift of the anterior margin of the third ventricle.
No osseous pathology is seen.
There is moderate mucosal thickening within the ethmoid sinuses with multiple small air fluid levels within the sphenoid sinus air cells.
Right basilar atelectasis also stable.
Stable left lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis with small and stable left pleural effusion.
Right basilar atelectasis.
CT BRAIN [**4-10**]: There is increased low density in the posterior frontal lobe on the right and in the caudate nucleus and basal ganglia.
There is a slight area of increased density in the central portion of this which could reflect some reactive "luxury" perfusion or could represent some petechial hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of increased mass effect.
A gross hematoma is not identified.
There is no evidence of abnormality in the left hemisphere.
IMPRESSION: Evolutionary changes with possible petechial hemorrhage.

There has been no overt hemorrhagic transformation.
Degree of mass effect, including slight hippocampal herniation, is unaltered.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.

A small area of hemorrhage is identified in the right putamen.
No evidence of thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic malignancy.
Patchy consolidation within the left lung, worst in the left lower lobe, and to a lesser extent also in the left upper lobe.
Findings are most suspicious for aspiration, with associated pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 19 yo woman with migraines, no other known stroke risk factors or PMH, no ocps or smoking, who presented with acute right MCA stroke, superior division, s/p IV TPA with no recannulization, then s/p angiography with revascularization of MCA achieved by balloon, no IA TPA.
She underwent daily CT scans for days due to the presence of edema and midline shift; neurosurgery was consulted for the possibility of hemicraniectomy to relieve swelling, but she did not need this procedure.
Other labs are listed in the "results" section of this summary, as are all imaging results with the exception of several chest xrays.
The patient had a traumatic intubation and pharyngeal swelling/likely hematoma.
She developed a ventillator associated pneumonia and sputum grew MRSA.
Her exam at transfer was significant for soft voice but fluent language, weakness of the left arm and left facial droop, with right gaze preference though improved movement of the eyes past the midline on extraocular muscle assessment.
RESP - Pneumonia resolved, no pulmonary issues.
CV - At one point exhibited some orthostatic hypotension, but improved with increased hydration, and has not recurred.
The left facial droop and left arm weakness (especially distally) persisted, but she was able to walk well.
Workup for potential causes of stroke were pursued, including CT of torso to rule out malignancy (negative).
Workup for potential hematologic and rheumatologic causes of stroke were also pursued.
ID - Completed 10 days of treatment with Zosyn and Vancomycin for ventilator-associated pneumonia (grew MRSA from sputum).
GI - Had some loose stools which resolved.
