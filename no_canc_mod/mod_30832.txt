She was then seen at 9 pm and was found to be not moving her left side or speaking.
On arrival, I found her saying only her name and following only simple commands on the right.
NIHSS was limited by severe aphasia and poor cooperation.
She was brought to the CT scanner and found to have no bleed, but she did have a hyperdense MCA sign on the right(corresponding with symptoms).
She was emergently brought to the SICU after speaking with her attending and her sister to clarify both her wishes and also the nature of her apparent hemorrhoidal bleeding given that we were considering tpa.
The attending felt that her risk was very low for having a source of her bleeding other than hemorrhoids.
She had no immediate changes.

5 mm and min reactive on left.
Apparent left hemianopsia vs neglect.
III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact grossly, but no formal eval.
Progression of hypodensities corresponding to edema in areas of restricted diffusion on MRI, consistent with evolving ischemic infarct in these areas.3.
Unchanged appearance of dense right MCA, consistent with persistent clot despite thrombolysis  MRI head [**2121-1-21**]: Evolving right middle cerebral artery infarction as well as hemorrhage within the medulla.
Ech [**2121-1-21**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with anteroseptal and apical akinesis with mild to moderate hypokinesis elsewhere.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The  mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation  is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+]  tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course: Neurology: Patient was admitted to ICU after patient received IV TPA for acute stroke within 3 hours from onset of stroke symptoms ([**2121-1-20**] 10 pm).
Head CT 24 hours after IV TPA given showed a medullary hemorrhage.
Though she had some minimal responsiveness to voice (awoke to voice)and was able to move right arm/leg spontaneiously her family decided to make her CMO as she had made prior wishes not to be in nursing care and would not have liked to tracheostomy or PEG dependent.
