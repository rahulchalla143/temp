There is no active contrast extravasation to suggest an aortic tear.
Soft tissue anterior to the heart may represent thymic tissue.
There is no mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal and sagittal reformatting again demonstrates a small amount of fluid around the ascending aorta without evidence of active contrast extravasation.
BONE WINDOWS: No fracture is detected.
IMPRESSION: Small fluid collection around the ascending aorta.
No active contrast extravasation.
Etiologies include venous bleed and possibly the sequellae of aggressive hydration.
MRI/MRA CHEST FINDINGS: There is trace pericardial fluid, which appears significantly less when compared with the chest CT performed the same day.
No evidence of mediastinal hematoma.
The thoracic aorta is normal in appearance, without evidence of dissection, pseudoaneurysm or transection.
Trace pleural effusions are noted bilaterally.
No gross consolidation of the lungs is identified.
Signal within the bony structures is normal, with no gross fractures identified.
Multiplanar reformations were essential for diagnosis, and confirm the above findings.
No evidence of mediastinal hematoma or aortic injury.
CT BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial fluid collection, mass effect or midline shift.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
BILATERAL TIBIA/FIBULA, FOUR VIEWS TOTAL: There are no fractures, dislocations, or focal lesions.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted on [**2185-10-3**] after a motor vehicle collision, ambulatory at scene, GCS15, complaining of bilateral knee pain, no shortness of breath or chest pain.
Initial CT scan of chest showed some mediastinal fluid.
The cardiothoracic surgery team (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] was consulted, and recommended close monitoring in the ICU, along with MRI/MRA of the chest (results above).
Echocardiography of the heart on [**10-3**] & [**10-4**] showed no pericardial effusion.
The patient had no complaints of dyspnea or chest pressure, and remained hemodynamically stable throughout her stay.
Ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed for pain   Followup Instructions: With your Primary Care doctor as needed.
If you have pain or discomfort that lasts more than 1 week, please call the Trauma Clinic at  ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 376**] to schedule a follow-up appointment.
