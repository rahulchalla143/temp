Given his low platelet counts (74) at [**Hospital1 **] and at [**Hospital1 18**], a hematology consult was obtained for further evaluation.
His thrombocytopenia had been previously documented and worked up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30843**].
An abdominal ultrasound showed no signs of splenomegaly and his heparin-dependent antibody assay was negative.
