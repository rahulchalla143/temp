Pt had "low-grade" temp to 100F, with chills and body aches.
Pt had no n/v/d, no sputum production.
Pt did feel a subjective wheezing sensation.
A CXR revealed worsening Right middle lobe infiltrate from prior study, with a questionable LLL infiltrate as well.
Pt received Azithro, ceftriazone, nebs, magnesium, solumedrol for wheezing and ?asthma exacerbation, as well as a heparin bolus and gtt.
Given pt's hypoxia, pt was given a CTPE to r/o PE in addition to pneumonia.
This was read by [**Hospital1 39933**] radiologists as showing b/l PEs, in addition to b/l multifocal pneumonia.
PT was given Tamiflu for concern for influenza, and the CT study was sent to radiology for a 2nd read.
Pt had a persistent air leak on bipap mask, and required multiple mask revisions.
An informal bedside echo in the ED revealed no RV strain, and her EKG revealed no R heart strain.
She was conversational but breathing quickly, and complained of continuing dry cough and anxiety.
PT also complained of a wheezing sensation, but otherwise stated that she felt "well."

**FINAL REPORT [**2132-2-1**]**    Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2132-2-1**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2132-2-1**]):       Negative for Influenza B.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Multifocal ground-glass opacities, worse in the upper zones, most compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
The examination is suboptimal for assessment of pulmonary emboli to the subsegmental levels, No large PE is detected.
If there remains a high clinical concern for small emboli, a repeat CTA could be considered.
Many small foci of consolidation and ground-glass opacification, most prominent around both hila have not changed since [**1-31**] consistent with a multifocal, probably non-bacterial pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 29 yo F smoker with no other significant PMHx presents with dry cough and worsening dyspnea over 3 days, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on BiPap for hypoxia with chest CT showing multifocal pneumonia.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Multifocal pneumonia:  CTA chest from [**Hospital1 **] showed multifocal pneumonia and possible pulmonary embolisms, so patient arrived on heparin gtt.
Upon re-read of CTA by [**Hospital1 18**] attending radiologist, no pulmonary embolism was seen, so she was taken off the heparin gtt.
Given diffuse wheezing on exam, prednisone 40mg was started as well as ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for treatment of severe CAP (started on [**1-31**]).
She was also given a Rx for albuterol inhaler, given her continued mild wheezing.
# Smoking - Pt encouraged regarding smoking cessation, verbalized understanding of the importance of quitting, especially now given the severity of her pneumonia.
CHRONIC, INACTIVE ISSUES: # Anxiety - continued on gabapentin TID.
Should follow up with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] CODE this admission  Medications on Admission: Gabapentin 600mg TID Ibuprofen 400mg q8h prn pain   Discharge Medications: 1. gabapentin 300 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day).
