Aneurysmal interatrial septum.
No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Mildly dilated LV cavity.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
Mildly dilated aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Mildly dilated descending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Partial mitral leaflet flail.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
4.The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is posterior mitral leaflet flail, most likely to be P2 scallop..
Mild to moderate ([**1-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen, however severity maybe underestimated given eccetricity of the jet.
A mitral annulus ring is well positioned.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance with HCFA regulations.
