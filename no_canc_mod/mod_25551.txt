No prior influenza or recent pneumonia vaccination.
Per daughter had never seen him go to the doctor until two months with 'episodes' of shortness of breath, turning purple and tripoding to breath.
CTA with pulmonary effusions, edema but no thrombus.
RIJ placed for progressive hypotension, but Norepinephrine only started upon leaving the ED with VS 83/57.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral akinesis (prior myocardial infarction).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Right adrenal myelolipoma.
Correlation with prior imaging or renal ultrasound in 6 months is recommended for further evaluation.
The lung volumes have slightly increased.
The distribution and severity of the pre-described parenchymal changes is unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo M with h/o COPD, tobacco use, found unresponsive and cyanotic while sitting on toilet after several days of progressive SOB; intubated at [**Hospital3 4107**] (first attempted by EMS); admitted to the ICU upon arrival due to persistent hypotension and need for mechanical ventilation.
# Respiratory arrest.
Etiology uncertain but would consider COPD exacerbation (worsening SOB x several days with steroid burst per PCP); PNA (not visualized on CXR but may be dry); cardiac ischemic event (EKG without concerning changes but no prior); PE (CTA preliminary negative); aspiration (but was upright on toilet) or seizure (but reportedly worsened over several day period).
Treated with steroid burst, antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia and nebulizer treatment (Ipratroprium / Albuterol).
On [**2200-1-28**] he had new respiratory distress requiring re-intubation.
This was due to a combination of variables including mucous plugging and treatment with high flow oxygen that decreased his intrinsic respiratory drive.
# Hypotension: Initially unclear etiology.
Considerations included sepsis (infectious vs cardiogenic; obstructive but no PE on CTA) vs. breath stacking with ventilator / COPD vs new process such as pneumothorax s/p line placement.
Could also be ischemia vs seizure (low suspicion).
Though chest imaging never developed a true infiltrate, was treated for community acquired pneumonia.
Treated for exacerbation as above.
Discharged with Tiotroprium, Advair, Duonebs and Pulmonary follow-up.
# Cardiac Dysfunction: As noted above with some elevated troponins (peak 0.11 on [**1-25**]) indicative of demand ischemia.
# Renal cysts: Noted on CT scan, patient should have repeat ultrasound in 6 months post-discharge.
# Hyperglycemia: New and associated with steroid burst.
