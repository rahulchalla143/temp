Her husband noted worsening asterixis and recognized this as a sign of impending encephalopathy, so he brought her in to the ED for further evaluation.
While in the waiting room the pt became more combative and then unresponsive, consistent with her prior episodes of encephalopathy.
Per the husband she had been religious with her lactulose.
She was unresponsive but able to protect her airway and so not intubated.
A urinalysis and CXR were done and are pending on transfer, and a FAST revealed hepatosplenomegaly but no intraperitoneal fluid.
She is being admitted to the MICU for further care given her mental status.
NGT was placed to suction and 1.5L bilious material was drained.

Heterogenous liver consistent with end stage disease related to sarcoid.
Head CT ([**10-10**]): IMPRESSION: Unchanged head CT with no acute intracranial pathology.
No free air in the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Mechanical small bowel obstruction proximal to the terminal ileus.
The cecum and terminal ileus or tethered together in the right lower quadrant likely secondary to adhesions.
Ground-glass changes in the lungs bilaterally, possibly due to pulmonary edema.
Emphysematous changes in the lungs consistent with stated diagnosis of COPD.
CXR ([**10-14**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study earlier in this date, there is some prominence of interstitial markings with [**Last Name (un) 16765**] lines, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
Poor definition of the retrocardiac region raises the possibility of some atelectatic change at the base.
CXR ([**10-17**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the sequence of previous films from earlier in this month, there has been clearing of the left pleural effusion.
Prominence of interstitial markings may reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, chronic lung disease, or both.
No acute focal pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Small bowel obstruction ??????
CT from [**10-10**] showed a transition point in the mid-distal ileum and no ascites.
Surgery was consulted and an NG was placed with return of 1.5L of bilious fluid.
Output then decreased and stools picked up so the NG tube was removed.
2) Anemia ??????
Acute normocytic anemia.
Initial hematocrit of 41 was likely due to dehydration as her baseline is in the mid 20s.
She was transfused 1 U pRBCs on [**10-14**] and about 1 hour later developed acute pulmonary edema with SBP 200 and HR 130.
She received lasix 40mg IV and her symptoms and vitals rapidly improved with a 1L output.
3) Hepatic sarcoidosis: Complicated by recurrent encephalopathy, patient status post TIPS and revision.
She also initially received empiric flagyl to prevent bacterial translocation, but this was deemed unnecessary and discontinued.
Her amitriptyline and zolpidem were held due to her encephalopathy and may be restarted as an outpatient if appropriate.
3) Pneumonia ??????
On [**10-12**], she spiked to 101.7 and there was concern for an infiltrate on CXR.
She was started on vanc/zosyn, narrowed to zosyn, and was subsequently afebrile and without leukocytosis.
4) ARF ??????
She was given IV LR for prerenal azotemia and her furosemide and spironolactone were held.
She was also noted to have a GBS UTI and was orinigally given Pen G, but it was determined that the zosyn (see above) was adequate coverage.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: hepatic encephalopathy, acute renal failure, small bowel obstruction Secondary: hepatic sarcoidosis, hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: 1)You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with confusion, worsened kidney function, and recurrence of the obstruction in your intestines.
We made the following medication changes: - Holding your amitriptyline and zolpidem due to your recent confusion.
