Per pt's wife since he got sick with the pneumonia his Parkinson's has been acting up and he has been having increasing trouble swallowing.
Wife states he has had a worsening cough and has been feeling a little SOB.
Initial labs were notable for leukocytosis to 17 (89% N).
He was then given boluses of 1L NS x 3 and BP improved to 120's and he was transferred to the MICU.
CAD s/p CABG and NSTEMIs ([**2-/2117**]: LIMA-LAD, SVG->Diag, OM1, OM2, SVG->PDA); s/p PCI of proximal SVG-D1-OM 1-OM2 with DES in [**6-29**] and PCI of SVG-OM/D with DES in [**8-29**].
Hypercholesterolemia 5.
HTN 6. h/o TIA 7.
Family History: Positive for father, who died of a stroke, mother who had a stroke in her 90s and one brother had [**Name (NI) 5895**] disease.
NECK: No carotid bruit, + elevated JVP.
HEART: unable to ausculatate heart sounds due to loud respiratory noises.
ABDOMEN: Soft, NT/ND, NABS, no masses or bruits.
EXTREMITIES: LE's with trace edema.
Skin: +rash on knees   Pertinent Results: CXR [**2118-4-17**]: Two views of the chest demonstrate stable [**Month/Day/Year 1192**] cardiomegaly, mediastinal contours, and sternal sutures.
There has been significant improvement in airspace opacity of the right middle and lower lobes seen on [**2118-4-10**].
A small amount of residual opacity remains in these locales.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There has been no change from [**2118-4-10**] in multiple thoracic vertebral wedge deformities and associated kyphosis.
IMPRESSION: Improving right middle and right lower lobe pneumonia.
ECG: NSR at 97. nl axis, borderline QT interval.
ST depressions in I, II, AVL, V3-6 (old), J point elevation in V1-2 (old).
Progressive multifocal pneumonia.
[**4-21**] head ct: FINDINGS: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
Irregular low attenuation foci in bilateral lentiform nuclei, left greater than right with associated volume loss are consistent with chronic lacunar infarction.
Scattered focal low attenuation lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter are consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Worsening left lower lobe pneumonia .
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in echotexture with no focal masses.
A nonshadowing gallstone or sludge ball is seen within the gallbladder measuring 8 x 7 x 5 mm.
There is no biliary dilatation.
There is no ascites.
The right kidney measures 11.2 cm, and there is no hydronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo M with Parkinson's, CAD, s/p recent admission for pna now with likely aspiration pna [**2-25**] increased secretions .
Micu course involved, the patient had hypotension and was given IVF and zosyn/vanc (concern for pna/sepsis).
The patient had angioedema and was switched to levo/flagyl.
The cause was likely multifactorial including poor intake likely due to parkinsons's disease, increased diarrhea and finally possibly some sepsis as with white count and pneumonia.
# pneumonia: The patient had presumed aspiration pneumonia as the patient had increased secretions.
In the MICU he was on zosyn and vancomycin but had angioedema and due to this allergic reaction, he was switched to levofloxacin and flagyl.
He continued to fail speech and swallow evaluations given his increased secretions.
During his course he developed an increased white count, an increased work of breathing and tachypnea.
His cxr showed worsening and he was presumed to have worsened aspiration pneumonia, especially given his ongoing risk of aspiration.
The patient had an episode of hypoxia and tachycardia, which was attributed to his increasing secretions.
The inpatient team did not have any medication changes to add, though they recommended Movement Disorders consult as his dysphagia may have been related to Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.
Unfortunately without his medications the patient became more bradykinetic and as his pulmonary status worsened a G tube was declined and the patient was without medications.
He pulled out his NG tube, and at that point the family decided the patient would continue a modified diet, but would likely continue to have pneumonia based on his high risk of continued aspiration.
Palliative care was called in, and during a family meeting, the family with the help of the team decided to have a G-tube placed.
The patient was found to have elevated INR, and the GI team felt his risk of bleeding was very high and despite reversal of his INR GI decided he was a poor candidate for a Gtube given his worsening clinical status.
# Transaminitis: The patient developed a transaminitis that may have been related to his medications as with medication adjustment, his lft's improved.
# Elevated INR: The patient was noted to have elevated INR through his course this was likely multifactorial including from abx, poor nutrition and liver disease.
# Melena: The patient was noted to have melena, and also blood in his NGT, given his repeated failed attempts at NG tube placement this was attributed to trauma, and his hematcrit was followed closely and remained stable.
# thrombocytopenia: The patient developed a significant drop in his platelets during his course and the concern was for HIT versus his antibiotics.
# Altered mental status: The patient was very lethargic during his course, and this was attributed to his pneumonia as he improved when his infection improved.
Towards the end of his course as his aspiration worsened and he was not able to get his parkinson's medications the patient became somnolent and lethargic.
# CHF: On admission the patient had an elevated BNP and a recent EF of 30%.
Given his initial hypotension and then diarrhea, his lasix was held and his ins/outs and daily weights were followed.
# Diarrhea: The patient had profuse diarrhea and this was concerning for c. difficile given antibiotic use.
# history of CAD s/p CABG: The patient had no active issues during his course.
# CMO: On [**4-27**] the patient had hypoxia and tachycardia.
His respiratory status was worse and he was having increased secretions.
