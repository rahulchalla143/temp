History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 65193**] is a 65 yo F with history of CAD, dCHF, HTN, HL, DM II, CKD, ILD, COPD and OSA (on CPAP) who was transfered from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for management of hyperglycemia.
Patient was admitted to OSH on [**2158-8-21**] with headache and "upset stomach".
In the OSH ED she developed L sided SSCP; EKG revealed ST depressions in the lateral leads and TWI in the inferior leads.
She subsequently ruled out for MI and underwent a phamacological stress test with nuclear imaging that revealed small reversible defect of the inferior apical wall and a TTE that showed EF 55-60% and mild-moderate AS.
Her course was complicated by dificult to control hyperglycemia (BG up to 800s) requiring 80 [**Location 16422**]500 TID, 20 units of novolog with meals and prn IV insulin to maintain BG in 300-400 range.

There is also a faint opacity in the right upper lobe could reflect another focus of developing infection or atelectasis.
There is mild vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema, sizeable pleural effusion, pneumothorax.
Lung volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
There is relative prominence of the right hilum and could be related to vascular engorgement.
Linear opacity in left mid lung region is consistent with atelectasis, and small amount of pleural fluid persists in the right minor fissure.
No new areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 65 year old female with multiple medical problems who was transferred from [**Name (NI) 1474**] Hospital for management of hyperglycemia.
While at [**Hospital1 1474**] she had a pharmacologic stress test showing a small inferoapical reversible defect; TTE showed EF 55-60% and mild-moderate AS.
Admission U/A was consistent with UTI, and urine cultures grew cipro resistant, nitrofurantoin sensitive E. Coli.
She was transferred to the floor where she continued her course of nitrofurantoin, was followed closely by [**Last Name (un) **] for her diabetes, and was diuresed due to her decompensated diastolic heart failure.
She had episodes of SVT while on the floor which became less frequent.
# Hyperglycemia: Etiology of her increased insulin requirement remained unclear but was hypothesized to be due to an occult UTI given her UA showing WBC.
# Urinary tract infection:  She was initially begun on ciprofloxacin; when sensitivities for E.coli came back resistant to cipro on [**2158-8-31**], she was started on a 7 day course of nitrofurantoin 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Decompensated dCHF:  She was ruled out with troponins WNLs x 2.
By the time of her discharge she was asymptomatic from a respiratory standpoint but still with significant peripheral edema.
She maintained a HCO3 of approximately 34 throughout her stay, likely a contraction alkalosis secondary to aggressive diuresis.
# CAD: When the patient arrived on the ICU, she was complaining of SOB and chest pain, for which she had multiple unchanged EKGs from prior.
# Supraventricular tachycardia:  She had episodes of SVTs both in the ICU and on the general medicine floor.
They were narrow complex and regular, lasting approximately 20-30 beats and resolving without intervention.
# Tooth pain.
Pain in her posterior left, mandibular molar was her chief complaint on arrival to the general medicine service.
On exam, the tooth was eroding through the gums without significant erythema and without obvious abscess.
# COPD:  Patient reported a longstanding nighttime requirement of 2L, but only wearing 2L by day over the several weeks prior to her presentation to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.
Still, she became anxious when not on O2 despite our recommendations to go without supplementation during the day.
# Constipation: She was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen.

Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital due to uncontrollably high blood sugars.
While at [**Hospital1 1474**], you had a stress test done on your heart that showed a small area of low blood flow; you elected not to undergo cardiac catheterization due to your shortness of breath while lying flat.
You were noted to have a urinary tract infection (UTI), which we treated with an antibiotic called nitrofurantoin.
You were monitored on telemetry for several days due to some episodes of fast heart rate, which gradually became less frequent.
You also had some tooth pain, which was evaluated by both a dentist and an oral surgeon; they recommended having the tooth extracted as an outpatient.
You also had some persistent sore throat and post-nasal drip, which improved somewhat when we started [**Doctor First Name 130**].
