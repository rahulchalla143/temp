Brief Hospital Course: ## Diabetic ketoacidosis: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for DKA who p/w severe nausea and vomiting on [**2183-9-27**] after binge drinking the night before.
Received one dose of Vancomycin and Zosyn given leukocytosis, but there was no sign of infection, so antibiotics were not continued.
Social Work was instrumental in identifying that her insurance payor, Mass Health, would cover Free Style Light test strips, so this was called in to the pharmacy, in addition to a new glucometer and lancets.
## Troponin elevation: Patient complained of chest pain on arrival to ED.
EKG was remarkable for non-specific changes and evidence of LVH.
Cardiology was consulted and felt that troponin leak was due to cardiac membrane instability in the setting of DKA.
The patient also provided history that she occasionally develops chest tightness when ascending the walkway to her PCP's office.
Thus, a pharmacologic stress test was obtained for risk stratification, which was positive for reversible perfusion defects and a drop in blood pressure after stress.
Cardiology spoke with patient and her daughter, and they ultimately decided to pursue cardiac catheterization on [**2183-10-2**], which showed normal coronary arteries.
Patient denied further episodes of chest pain.
## Acute kidney injury: Cr on presentation was 1.6, which was due to dehydration in setting of DKA, EtOH use, and poor po intake.
Blood cx showed no growth.
## Transaminitis: Presented with mild transaminitis in setting of alcohol abuse and DKA.
RUQ US showed no evidence of cirrhosis.
## Alcohol use: Patient was discouraged from drinking alcohol due to its own toxicity but also in hindering glycemic control.
