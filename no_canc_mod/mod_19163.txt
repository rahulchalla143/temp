Cardiac catheterization x2 with thrombectomy and drug eluting stent to the obtuse marginal artery   History of Present Illness: 71 yo male wiht h/o CABG in [**2186**], PTCA [**2192**], s/p stenting [**2197**] (unknown anatomy, getting records from the [**Hospital1 756**]), smoking, HTN, HLD, and diabetes who is presenting with chest discomfort.
The patient reports that the night prior to presentation, he developed left sided chest pain; dullness without any radiation.
No associated diaphoresis, but reports slight nausea and shortness of breath.
The pain was persistent, and did not respond to SL Nitro.
The pain also progressively worsened over the course of the day, prompting the patient to call EMS.
EMS gave to SL NG sprays, with no relief.
The patient does not remember if this chest pain is similar to pain he had in the past prior to his past cardiac events.
Reports increasing LE swelling; reports that he has never had swelling like this before.
Of note, the patient's wife reports that he has been chest pain free for about one year.
Denies any recent travel, no long plane rides.
He had a stress test (due to chest pain) in [**Month (only) **], which showed 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia at achieved workload single vessel CAD-new regional dysfunction with distal inferior hypokinesis.
On ROS, the patient denies any recent fevers/chills, no blood in stools, no changes in bowel movements, no urinary symptoms.
Denies any lightheadedness or dizziness.
He was initially given 1 L of fluid and treated for COPD excacerbation with azithromycin, prednisone, and nebulizers.
He then developed respiratory distress and required NRB.
worsening pulmonary edema and patient was given 20 mg IV lasix.
EKG unchanged from priors, found to have elevated troponin and started on IV heparin, given ASA.
Received 8 mg morphine, 1 mg Dilaudid and now chest pain free.

Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo male with h/o CABG in [**2186**], PTCA [**2192**], s/p stenting [**2197**], smoking, HTN, HLD, and diabetes who is presented with chest pain and was found to have NSTEMI and acute diastolic CHF exacerbation.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: .
# NSTEMI: Mr. [**Known lastname 71328**] was admitted to the CCU with a chief complaint of chest pain without ST elevations on EKG and a significant coronary history including CABG followed by PTCA and stenting.
# Acute Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure Exacerbation: Mr. [**Known lastname 71328**] was without history of CHF but was hypoxic of NRB on arrival to CCU with prominent rales on exam, CXR c/w with pulmonary edema, and peripheral edema.
The etiology of his CHF was thought to be related to his acute MI exacerbated by administration of 1LNS in the ED.
He was counseled on maintaining a low sodium diet as well as taking daily weights to monitor his fluid balance.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: His creatinine on admission was 1.3 (up from baseline of 1.1).
This was likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of MI and diastolic CHF.
# COPD:  Pt does not have dx of COPD, but with flattened diaphragms and parenchymal findings on CXR consistent with COPD in the context of extensive smoking history.
He was given prednisone/azithromycin in ED for concern of COPD exacerbation that was later felt to be consistent with CHF exacerbation.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: .
# Hypertension: Stable.
# BPH: Stable.
# Changes were made to his anti-hypertensive regimen and this issue should be revisited during an outpatient visit.
6. nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.

You had chest pain and a cardiac catheterization that showed a large clot in one of the heart arteries.
It is extremely important that you take plavix every day to prevent the stent from closing off and causing another heart attack.
Do not stop taking plavix or miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11014**]s unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] tells you it is OK. .
If your blood pressure goes back up yuor doctor may want to restart some of these medicines.
You had some fluid in your lungs that was removed with intravenous medicines.
You will need to weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
START taking nitroglycerin only as needed for chest pain at home.
Call 911 for any chest pain that is still there after 2 nitroglycerin tablets.
