Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation and management of your shortness of breath.
Re-evaluation by ENT again revealed that you have a condition called PVFM, or paradoxical vocal fold motion.
Your condition is exacerbated by anxiety and learning how to cope with the anxiety associated with your condition will help you successfully live with your condition without having to go to the hospital.
Relaxation techniques, use of anxiety medication such as Ativan or Alprazolam (Xanax), and possibly medications used for asthma flare ups such as nebulized albuterol or steroids.
