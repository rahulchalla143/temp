Admission Date:  [**2179-6-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-6-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2134-4-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 301**] Chief Complaint: Morbid obesity  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Laprascopic roux-en-y gastric bypass.
EGD with endoscopic clipping of bleeding artery at gastro-jejunal anastomosis.
IVC filter placement.
History of Present Illness: 45M with a history of obesity for 40 years.
He has tried multiple exercise and diet programs without any sustained success.
He has been extensively evaluated and medically cleared for bariatric surgery.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Gen: no acute distress, alert and oriented CV: RRR, no murmurs Pulm: clear bilaterally Abd: obese, soft, nontender, normal bowel sounds Ext: no edema, normal strength and tone  Pertinent Results: Barium swallow: post-op IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated gastric pouch with no evidence of obstruction or leak.
There are equivocal filling defects noted within the right main pulmonary artery with possible extension into the right upper lobe branch.
Bilateral segmental lower lobe and right middle lobe atelectasis.
Scattered centrilobular ground-glass opacities predominantly within the upper lobes are nonspecific; however, infectious or inflammatory process such as aspiration pneumonitis/developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.
No evidence of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass leak.
No evidence of obstruction with previously administered barium progressed into the large bowel.
This was thought to be an upper airway bleed at first.
Gastroenterology was then consulted and the patient was prepped for an emergent exploratory laparoscopy with intra-operative EGD to assess for bleeding within the GI tract.
Upon exploration of the abdomen no extraluminal intra-abdominal bleed was identified.
The anastomosis was tested for a leak and there was none.
The endoscope was passed down to the jejuno-jejunal anastomosis and no blood or bleeding was identified.
On POD1 he was extubated without difficulty.
On POD2 he passed his barium swallow as no leak or obstruction was noted.
In the early afternoon he acutely desaturated down to 80% and complained of some dyspnea.
He was emergently taken to radiology for a CT angio of his chest and due to the fact that he received barium earlier in the day it was decided to scan his abdomen and pelvis to further evaluate for an anastomotic leak.
There was a suspicious filling defect in his right main pulmonary artery and it was uncertain as to whether or not this was a pulmonary embolus.
There was no extraluminal contrast seen in the abdomen.
Due to the uncertainty of the pulmonary artery filling defect it was decided to proceed with care as if it was a pulmonary embolus.
