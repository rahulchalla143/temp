The previously noted focal hypodensity adjacent to the left frontal gyrus is no longer apparent, and likely represented an artifact.
Abd U/S: ) Patent intrahepatic vasculature.
2) Cholelithiasis, without son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute cholecystitis.
3) Trace perihepatic ascites .
CXR ([**5-13**]): Increasing alveolar air space opacities most likely representing aspiration.
Small right apical pneumothorax.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral  valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is  no pericardial effusion.
Moderate residual within the vallecula/piriform sinuses, requiring multiple swallows to clear.
CXR:Bilateral upper lobe air space consolidation.
# Tylenol PM overdose/fulminant hepatic failure: Her initial level was >500 which was very very concerning for potential fulminant liver failure.
She was maintained on D10 fluids while her LFTS were climbing and an no episodes of hypoglycemia.
Since the patient had recently used IVD, she was not a canditate for transplant.
Of note, the patient underwent a liver bx at [**Hospital1 2025**] (records in chart) in [**2185**] which showed chronic hep C without cirrhosis.
It is unclear whether the Hep A Ab represents prior infection vs. immunization; however, her HepBcAb positivity indicates that she was exposed to the virus in the past.
The patient's renal failure was worsening at time of transfer to the floor.
# Acidosis- The patient was admitted with an ABG 7.23/22/300s c/w and anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.
There was high suspicion for ketoacidosis given she has been down for an unknown period of time, but urine ketones negative.
Her lactate, however, was 12.5, so likely all [**1-28**] lactic acidosis from hypotension, low tissue perfusion, and less likely sepsis.
As her renal failure progressed, she developed a gap metabolic acidosis from uremia and a comcominant metabolic alkalosis of unknown cause.
# GI bleed-At the OSH, the patient reportdely had 500cc of coffee ground emesis from her NGT once it was placed.
No evidence of bleeding here.
# Anemia: The paitent likley has a baseline anemia, exacerbated by her renal and liver failure and her recent bleed.
Pt's stools were OB negative and there was no evidence of hemolysis on lab studies.
She should be work-up for Fe deficiency as an outpatient.
# Elevated CK-Likely from being found down.
# Psych/IVDU-Multiple sucide attempts.
The Psychiatry service followed the pt while in-house and recommended starting seroquel for her anxiety.
She may receive haldol prn for agitation.
#AMS: As noted, pt had periods of agitation and confusion during her     hospitalization.
Head CT showed no bleed.
EEG revealed diffuse encephalopathy.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Tylenol overdose Acute Renal Failure Fulminant hepatic failure aspiration pneumonia Anemia Upper GI bleed   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor and return to the hospital for any fever/chills, shortness of breath, confusion, abdominal pain/swelling, or any other concerning symptoms you may have.
