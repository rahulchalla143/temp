Admission Date:  [**2136-5-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-7-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-5-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: NMED  Allergies: Phenytoin / Neosporin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7575**] Chief Complaint: seizures  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PEG tube placement, intubation x two  History of Present Illness: 65 yo LH man with h/o metastatic melanoma, initially dx'd [**2134-1-8**] s/p wide local excision, recurrence in the right parotid gland, s/p radical neck dissection [**9-8**], s/p adjuvant local field irradiation from [**10-9**] to [**11-8**] and finally adjuvant alpha-interferon, [**Date range (1) 44733**].
He was initially put on dilantin but developed a rash and gradually was placed on keppra as well as decadron because MRI showed changes in the right temporal lobe consistent with radiation necrosis.
His seizures are varied and are remarkable for aphasia as either the ictal or post-ictal phenomenon as well as generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
He was readmitted [**3-11**] after having 3 generalized seizures and prolonged post-ictal aphasia.
An EEG only showed PLEDS during this aphasia state.
He recently visited with his oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] on [**2136-5-10**] who performed torso CT which showed no evidence of systemic disease.
The "scooping" lasted 10 minutes and by the time she was able to pull over and get attention, his whole body is "swaying" with his left arm and leg but she is not able to give me a great description.
Past Medical History: 1. metastatic melanoma as above c/b radiation necrosis of the right temporal lobe and seizures 2. hypertension 3.
CAD s/p LAD stent [**4-10**]   Social History: Social history: lives with girlfriend, she gives him all his medicines   Family History: family history of MI, no family history of melanoma  Physical Exam: On admission:  Examination: T 95.6 BP 150/100 HR 72 RR 16 98% 2l General: ill appearing in NAD, cushingoid face HEENT: MMM Lungs: CTA bilaterally CV: RRR Abd: soft, NT Ext: no pedal edema, no rashes, multiple ecchymoses.
There is no obvious drift.
Gait and stance: deferred  Upon discharge: Exam: afebrile VSS Gen: sitting up in bed, NAD HEENT: moist mucous membranes Lungs: coarse anteriorly but no wheezing CV: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops Abd: soft and nontender Ext: hand wound granulating well, multiple ecchymoses unchanged Neuro: alert, eyes open, follows some one-step midline and appendicular commands.
He does not completely accurately show two fingers or point to the window or ceiling.
Motor exam: at least 4/5 strength but some limited cooperation due to decreased comprehension.
Pertinent Results: Phenobarbital level on [**2136-7-5**] = 35.1  Brief Hospital Course: He was admitted on [**2136-5-21**] after having seizures on keppra 2g po bid, lamictal 100mg po bid and decadron 2mg po bid.
He was admitted to the neurology [**Hospital1 **] service initially but while waiting in the ED for a bed, he continued to have recurrent seizure activity (at least 3 additional ones) which were treated with ativan, and then depakote was loaded as a third anticonvulsant [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Subsequently he was on the neurology icu service until [**2136-6-13**], when he was transferred to the MICU service for persistent fevers, chronic aspiration and nosocomial pneumonia.
A brief outline of his hospital course on neurology is as follows (also taken from Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 44735**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] note of [**2136-6-8**]):  [**5-21**]: dexamethasone increased for 2mg to 4mg [**Hospital1 **] for temporal lobe necrosis secondary to XRT therapy, lamictal dose increased, loaded with depakote  [**5-23**]: experienced some shaking, given phenobarbital, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges over right hemisphere (PLEDS) seen on EEG  [**Date range (1) 44736**]: repeat head CT with no change from [**5-21**], no hemorrhage.
He was unable to get MRI due to recent CAD stent.
Continuous EEG showed spikes and slow waves thus patient was intubated on [**5-25**] for versed coma ([**Date range (1) **]) for burst suppression.
[**5-25**]: anemic, requiring transfusions to keep hct>30 given CAD and recent stent placement in [**4-10**].
Also, spiked to 101.2 and started on ceftriax/vanco/flagyl for presumed aspiration pna  [**5-28**]: Urine growing enterococcus and sputum showing signs of infection, all [**Last Name (un) 36**] to levaquin so antibiotics changed to levofloxacin/flagyl.
[**6-6**]: extubated  [**Date range (1) **]: Patient started waking up (prolonged depressed mental status thought to be secondary to phenobarbital effect and post-ictal lethargy), alert, frontal signs- grasp, perseveration.
7/5-6: Plastic surgery expressed a large hematoma by I/D  [**2142-6-13**]: Transferred to MICU service for persistent fevers, chronic aspirations, frequent respiratory care due to inability to handle secretions.
An infectious disease consult recommended two weeks of vancomycin and ceftazidime for MSSA nosocomial pneumonia, but this was only given for one week, starting [**6-14**] ending on [**6-21**].
EEG showed spike/slow wave which resolved after ativan.
Thereafter it showed persistent periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDS) over the right hemisphere predominantly, with some occasional generalization over the left hemisphere, not correlating with any clinical seizure activity.
The decision was made with the family's knowledge that since the depakote on top of the ASA and Plavix was prolonging bleeding time, he would be transitioned to phenobarbital, while keeping keppra and lamictal the same.
Depakote was tapered after phenobarbital reached the goal level, and while sleepy, he remained without clinical seizure activity.
[**Date range (1) 44738**]: Unfortunately he was reintubated [**6-25**] for persistent secretions resistant to suctioning and tachypnea.
Vancomycin was ultimately changed to oxacillin because of absence of MRSA organisms to finish off the week's course.
Again, all cultures remained negative and the question of phenobarbital drug fever was raised.
[**Date range (1) 44739**]: He was extubated [**7-3**] and remained stable, requiring only 2l nasal cannula and occasional suctioning and chest PT.
Phenobarbital again is being titrated to goal level of mid- to high-30s, but he is waking up and following some commands.
MRI head done which shows no appreciable change from the last MRI obtained [**2136-3-8**], consistent with static radiation necrosis.
