He then awoke with a "rope-like" non-radiating chest discomfort with no associated symptoms except perhaps chills that resolving except the portion "over the heart."
EKG on presentation showed ST elevation in leads V3,4, and 5.
He was chest pain free prior to transfer.
He was taken to the c. cath lab showing subtotally occluded LAD with successful PTCA/stenting with 2.5 x 18 promus stent.
Of note, he was recently hospitalized at [**Name (NI) 75328**] [**Hospital 18806**] Medical [**Name2 (NI) **] in early [**Name (NI) 547**] for sepsis from a urinary source secondary to BPH.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: Coronary artery disease, STEMI transfer  PROCEDURE: Coronary angiography Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring performed by a member of the nursing staff.
We planned to treat this thrombus with aspiration thrombectomy/PTCA/stenting and heparin/integrilin given prophylactically.
An XB LAD 4.0 guiding catheter provided good support for the procedure and a Prowater wire was advanced into the distal LAD with moderate difficulty.
We then noted an acute cut-off in the distal LAD after flow was re-established and proceeded with cautious dotting of the cut-off area with the balloon and distal delivery of NTG via balloon with minimal improvement of distal LAD flow.
Final angiography revealed normal TIMI 3 flow in the vessel, no angiographically apparent dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the newly deployed stent but acute cut-off in distal LAD showed diffusely diseased small apical vesswel that remained unchanged despite mechanical dottering and distal NTG delivery via balloon.
The R 6Fr femoral artery sheath was removed post limited groin angiography and an Angioseal closure device was deployed without complications with distal pulses confirmed post deployment.
Emergent coronary angiography revealed a right dominant systemt.
The LAD revealed a mid 95% occlusion with thrombus.
Final angiography revealed normal TIMI 3 flow, no angiographically apparent dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the newly deployed stent with an abrupt cut-off in the distal LAD unchagned despite mechanical balloon dottering and distal NTG delivery via balloon.
Severe coronary artery disease with subtotally occluded mid LAD: see comments section.
R 6Fr femoral artery Angioseal closure device deployed without complications (see PTCA comments) 4.
Integrilin gtt for 18 hours post PCI for thrombus and abrupt cut-off of distal small vessel apical LAD unchanged despite mechanical balloon dottering and distal NTG delivery via balloon  B. TTE ([**2193-4-26**]) Conclusions The left atrium is elongated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid lateral hypokinesis and distal septal/distal anterior and apical septal hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
C. ECG No prior ECG available for comparison.

# STEMI Patient has known history of CAD given prior stent placement in OM2.
He presented with chest discomfort.
OSH ECG notable for ectopic atrial rhythm and ST elevations in V3, V4, and V5 and initial troponin 12.483 (unknown if I or T) and CK-MB 68.5.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for c. cath with successful PTCA/stenting with DES for 95 % subacute mid-LAD thrombus.
Final angiography revealed normal TIMI 3 flow and no angiographically apparent dissection.
Post-MI ECHO indicated LVEF 35-40 % withmild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid lateral hypokinesis and distal septal/distal anterior and apical septal hypokinesis.
This may be suggestive of another MI given that these wall motion abnormalities do not necessarily correspond to his LAD lesion.
He was continued on an integrilin infusion for 18 hours post PCI for thrombus and abrupt cut-off of distal small vessel apical LAD unchanged despite mechanical balloon dottering and distal NTG delivery via balloon.
# Hyperlipidemia Patient was not on lipid-lowering therapy on admission.
A1c was 6 suggestive of pre-diabetic state.
# RHYTHM: Patient remained in NSR during hospitalization with telemetry showing bradycardia to low 40s during sleep.
# BPH with urinary retention Patient was recently hospitalized at [**Name (NI) 75328**] Brothers in the state of [**Name (NI) 531**] for sepsis from a urinary source in the setting of urinary retention per provided records from family.
