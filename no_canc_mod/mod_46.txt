She was well until about 12 hours prior to admission when she described the acute onset of sharp right lower quadrant pain and diffuse/poorly characterized dull general abdominal pain.

Father had a history of hypertension  Physical Exam: temperature 100.8, pulse 81, blood pressure 109/71, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 100% on room air General: patient was in moderate distress, appeared acutely ill Head and neck: head atraumatic/normocephalic.
sclera anicteric.
No lymphadenopathy, no jvd Card: regular rate and rhythm Lungs: clear to auscultation Abdomen: soft, mildly distended.
Diffuse tenderness, RLQ>LLQ.
Positive for rebound, especially in lower abdomen Back: no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Pelvic exam: significantly limited secondary to discomfort, exquistite tenderness at the interoitus, unable to get in foot rests.
Minimal thin white discharge, right adnexal and fundal tenderness consistent with peritonitis  On discharge the patient had a well healing midline incision, as well as ostomy sites that were pink and healthy.
Her abdoment was soft and nondistended  Pertinent Results: Blood cultures negative, CMV IgG positive, CMV IgM negative, CMV DNA negative, RPR negative, Fungal culture negative, Stool negative for (camplobacter, salmonella, shigella, vibrio, yersina, ecoli 0157:H7, Cdificile, virus), HSVI/II negative, Hep B SAb positive, Hep BSAg negative, Cervical cultures negative for GC and chlamidyia, Rheumatoid factor negative, HIT negative, Cystic fibrosis negative, sickle negative, lupus anticoagulant negative, cryoglobulin negative, [**Doctor First Name **] 1:40, ANCA negative, HCG negative.
Fibroid uterus.
No ovarian torsion seen at the time of the exam, although clinical correlation is needed to entirely exclude this diagnosis.
Mild-to-moderate amount of nonspecific free pelvic fluid.
Abdominal CT [**2103-7-25**]: ABDOMEN CT WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a trace right pleural effusion and slight atelectasis at the right lung base.
The gallbladder is distended without CT evidence of wall edema.
The mid small bowel is distended with air-fluid levels.
There is severe thickening of the cecal wall.
These findings are most consistent with cecitis, which could be infectious or inflammatory.
There is a large amount of fluid tracking down from the abdomen.
There is severe cecal wall thickening.
IMPRESSION: 1) Inflammatory changes in the rigth lower quadrant most likely consistent with cecitis, which could be infectious or inflammatory.
3) Dilated mid small bowel loops, likely secondary to ileus.
4) Fibroid uterus.
Pathology: Appendix:     Acute appendicitis with acute serositis.
No evidence of vasculitis seen.
Severe vascular congestion, submucosal edema, and transmural acute hemorrhage.
Areas of acute transmural ischemic infarction (slides C and D).
c.  Distal margin:  No infarction.
d.  No convincing evidence of a primary vasculitis.
Scattered small veins have mural acute inflammation and fibrin thrombi, but these changes are almost certainly secondary to the colonic wall injury.
e.  One lymph node:  No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Peritoneal fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
No 2D echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis identified.+   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was initially taken emergently to the operating room for exploratory laparascopy with general surgery back up.
They observed a normal left tube and [**Last Name (un) 2046**], and copius greenish yellow fluid, as well as right lower quadrant adhesions and a diffusely inflammed small intestine.
The General surgery team became infvolved and noted that the appendix was acutely inflamed but there was no other pathology.
The patient was becoming edematous and the patient had increased respiratory distress.
In the operating room they discovered a retroperitoneum that was diffulsely petichial and ecchymotic, with significant retroperitoneal edema and bowel edema.
There was pathc purpuring darkening concerning for ischemia of the cecum.
The patient underwent a right colectomy, with an ileosotomy and right transverse colon mucous fistula.
The infectious disease and rheumatology services were consulted and were intimately involved, and the results of the studies they suggested are listed above.
The patients hemodynamic status improved, although the patient remained tachycardic and intermittently febrile, although cultures remained negative and the patient remained on broad spectrum antibiotics.
She continued to recieve fluid boluses for decreased urine output on post operative days 3 and 1.
On post operative days 5 and 3, the patient had an echocardiogram to rule out an embolic source for possible mesenteric ischemia, and a HIT panel was sent for decreased platelets.
