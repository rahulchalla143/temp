Source of infection thought to be right subclavian HD catheter vs b/l internal jugular and subclavian thrombosis (septic thrombophlebitis).
He had been treated with vanco at HD since his last admission for MRSA bacteremia.
He had a TEE which was negative for vegetations during his last admission.
He received Linezolid and Ceftaz initially for concern for Pseudomonas and VRE.
ID was consulted and felt the cause of his sepsis was likely a persistent MRSA infection and not VRE.
A repeat TEE on [**8-30**] was negative for vegetations.
Consider EP consult for AICD placement as an outpatient once his infection and thromboses have resolved.
# Right and left IJ venous thrombus and left subcalvian venous thrombus.
Right U/S revealed >80% stenosis of IJ.
# Coagulopathy.
His labs were concerning for DIC given his thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, occasional schistocytes on smear, low haptoglobin, elevated FDP's and D-dimer level.
# CAD -- ECG with slight lateral ST-depressions, not significantly changed from baseline.
His Trop was stable (baseline elevated secondary to renal failure).
# CHF -- He was euvolemic without evidence of CHF on CXR.
# ESRD on HD TRSatMon.
# Anemia [**1-6**] to ESRD.
He was transfused to keep his hct > 28 given h/o cad and pvd.
# Swallowing: Pt received a Speech and Swallow evaluation for aspiration risk and a video swall eval.
