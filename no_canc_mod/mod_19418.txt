Admission Date: [**2179-6-17**]        Discharge Date: [**2179-7-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2179-6-17**]        Sex:  M  Service:  NB   HISTORY:  This 32 and [**6-3**] week preterm baby who was admitted to the newborn ICU for management of respiratory distress and prematurity.
Pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes.
[**Hospital 37544**] medical history is significant for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
Mother has had complications of hemolyzing red blood cells and increased blood pressures since [**93**] weeks of pregnancy.
Mother had recurrent tachycardia in pregnancy.
Cardiology was consulted for etiology of tachycardia which is unknown at this time.
Mother was given betamethasone in light of potential preterm delivery.
At delivery, the mother was given general anesthesia due to maternal history of the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
Grade 1/6 systolic murmur at left upper sternal border and right upper sternal border, radiating to axilla and back.
His chest x-ray was consistent with surfactant deficiency and he responded nicely to surfactant replacement therapy.
He had mild apnea of prematurity, which was not treated with any medications and his quick self-resolved spells were last noted five days prior to discharge.
He was noted to have a soft systolic murmur on exam starting at about day 21 but this was felt clinically to be consistent with peripheral pulmonic stenosis (PPS) and hemodynamically he remains stable.
[**Known lastname **] was started on iron for anemia of prematurity, he will be discharged home on this.
Blood culture was also sent upon admission and [**Known lastname **] received 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamicin with negative cultures and improving clinical course.
NEUROLOGIC:  A head ultrasound was performed on day of life seven which revealed a subependymal cyst versus a germinal matrix hemorrhage on the left side.
A repeat ultrasound at a month of age showed that this cyst appeared to be located in the choroid plexus and likely benign.
PSYCHOSOCIAL:  This family has been present, caring for the babies in the nursery even in light of maternal illness and postpartum complications.
State newborn screen were sent per protocol and no abnormal results have been reported.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following four criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks; (2) Born between 32 weeks and 35 weeks with two of the following:  Day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings; (3) chronic lung disease or (4) hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
