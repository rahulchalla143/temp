Since that time, he has continued to complain of pleuritic chest pain.
EKG was remarkable for diffuse anterolateral ST depressions and T wave inversions.
An echocardiogram revealed severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and extensive apical akinesis.
Past Medical History: History of Pulmonary Embolus, Hypertension, GERD, s/p Appendectomy   Social History: Lives with his grandson, not working.

After discussion with his son, he became amenable to cardiac catheterization.
For several days, he remained pain free on medical therapy and cardiac enzymes continued to trend down.
On hospital day four, he experienced recurrent chest pain.
He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**1-25**] which revealed a left dominant system with left main and LAD disease.
The Left Main had a 70% long stenosis and the LAD had a 90% stenosis at its origin.
The LCX was a large dominant vessel with only minor luminal irregularities and the RCA was a small non-dominant vessel with an ostial 40% stenosis and mild diffuse disease.
Left ventriculography revealed severe systolic dysfunction with anterior, anteroapical and inferoapical akinesis.
He was taken back to the cath lab for IABP insertion on [**1-27**].
His chest pain improved but due to his instability, he underwent surgical revascularization surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**1-28**].
His CSRU was complicated by recurrent ventricular fibrillation.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed and showed no major change from a previous preop echocardiogram.
There was global hypokinesis with akinesis of the distal LV and apex.
Given concern for ischemia as a source for his ventricular dysrhythmias, repeat cardiac catheterization was performed to assess graft patency.
Subsequently he made steady improvement and was anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation.
No further ventricular rrhythmias were noted.
