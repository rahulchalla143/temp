Pt notes SOB since last night, + cough with clear sputum, + PND.

No recent diet or medication changes.
Past Medical History: - Type 1 diabetes - HIV (boosted atazanavir, lamivudine, stavudine), dx'd [**2096**] - ESRD on HD, planned change to peritoneal dialysis in near future, on transplant list (clinical study for HIV/solid organ transplant) - Recent hospitalizations for Serratia bacteremia (presumed source AV graft) most recently treated with 6 week course meropenem - History of schistosomiasis - Restless leg syndrome - Peripheral neuropathy on gabapentin - S/p cholecystectomy   Social History: Moved from [**Country 4812**] in [**2091**].

Pulm: crackles [**12-12**] way up b/l, no wheezes Abd: LLQ with PD catheter appears clean, although no dressing in place, soft, ND, ND, no HSM Ext: 2+ edema nonpitting b/l, 2+ distal pulses Neuro: CNs II-XII grossly intact.
CT w/o contrast: CT OF THE CHEST: Compared to prior CT from [**2109-3-26**], there is almost mareked improvement in the diffuse bilateral peribronchiolar opacities.
Since the last exam, there is interval developmen of a wedge-shaped area of consolidation within the left lung base, which may represent a pneumonia, however given its shape cannot exlude infarction.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes are seen which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion.
However, there is development of a new wedge-shaped opacity within the left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia versus infarction.
No filling defects are noted within the main pulmonary artery and its branches.
A rounded small pleural- based opacity in the posterior aspect of the left lung base is seen and unchanged when compared to a study dated [**2109-4-13**].
Small mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, not pathologically enlarged by CT criteria are again noted, unchanged.
No evidence of pericardial effusions.
Diffuse mild bilateral ground-glass opacities are unchanged when compared to a prior study.
The liver demonstrates two small hypodensities measuring 9 mm and 1.7 cm in segment V and VIII, respectively previously characterized as hemagioma.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Interval resolution of the left lower lobe wedge-shaped opacity.
Brief Hospital Course: A&P: 46 yo M hx T1DM, HIV, ESRD p/w dyspnea, elevated BP, low grade fevers and cough.
# SOB and HTN: The patient presented to the ED with fluid overload and hypertensive urgency and was started on a nipride drip.
His hypertension continued to be an issue following his first dialysis session, despite the removal of 5.2 L of fluid during that session.
Renal: The patient had recently transitioned from hemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis, which was apparently insufficient, resulting in fluid overload, hypertension and admission.
# Fevers: The patient briefly spiked a fever on [**4-13**] and underwent non-con CT of the chest.
He had increasing cough as well.
The patient's non-con Chest CT demonstrated a peripheral wedge shaped opacity, and the patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn, given his relative immunosuppression and his recent hospitalization with full course of levofloxacin.
A follow-up CTA was done to rule out PE and showed complete resolution of the wedge shaped area, which presumably was simply atelectasis.
For this reason, the patient was dosed one gram of ceftazadine and one gram of vancomycin following his dialysis on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**4-15**] and he was written a prescription to receive one gram of vancomycin and one gram of ceftazadine after each of his dialysis sessions on [**4-17**] and [**4-19**].
On the day of discharge, the patient's nasal viral swab returned positive for parainfluenza virus.
As discussed with ID, the patient's CT and clinical findings could all be explained by parainfluenza virus, but there was also a significant chance for bacterial superinfection.
He was also scheduled for followup with his infectious disease physicians on [**4-23**].
Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for cough.
Disp:*2 doses* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: End stage renal disease requiring regular hemodialysis Parainfluenza viral infection HIV Hypertensive urgency Volume overload   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with elevated blood pressure and respiratory difficulty which improved with dialysis.
However, your blood pressure continues to be elevated at times throughout the day.
Elevated blood pressures for a long period of time with increase your risk of stroke and heart disease.
You have a cough and imaging of your chest showed that you may have a small infection.
If you have a temperature greater than 100.4 that does not resolve quickly, you should call your primary care physician.
You had testing for TB during this hospitalization which was negative.
These doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] help [**Name5 (PTitle) **] with your blood pressure.
