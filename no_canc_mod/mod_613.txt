Admission Date:  [**2166-6-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-7-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2135-2-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**] Chief Complaint: sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PEG placement Intubation, tracheostomy Central line   History of Present Illness: This is a 31 yo F with a past medical history significant for hemorrhagic CVA 3 years ago, with a prolonged post CVA course, c/b tracheostomy and residual aphasia and r-sided hemiparesis, aspiration pneumonias, who per her mother has had a recent progressive decline with difficulty swallowing.
On the day of admission to the OSH, the patient developed abdominal pain and vomiting and was admitted for further work-up.
She had progressive respiratory distress and was then intubated for airway protection.
She was transferred to the OSH ICU for presumed aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, ARF and respiratory failure.
Per her mother, she has no seizure history, but is maintained on valproate, and was restarted on this at the OSH.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of her renal failure and possible sepsis.
She withdrew to pain but was otherwise unresponsive.
Past Medical History: - Diabetes Mellitus type 1 (dx at age 3), hx of hypoglycemic episodes - CVA (hemorrhagic) at 27 with residual aphasia and r-hemiparesis, tracheostomy post CVA now decannulated.
- blindness in one eye - history of aspiration pneumonia - although patient is on valproate, no reported history of stroke - depression  Social History: remote smoking history at age 18, lived in CA and has lived at the Greenery since coming to MA.
Neck:supple, JVP elevated 8cmH20 Lungs: diffuse rhonchi Chest: RRR II/VI sem at base Abd: soft NT, mild distention +BS Ext: no e/c/c Neuro: withdraws to pain, left-sided facial drooping, left sided ptosis; unclear [**Name2 (NI) 6954**] response.
Overall, the EEG showed a widespread encephalopathy with a slow low voltage background but also with some asymmetry.
Background voltages were notably lower on the left side, and there was additional focal slowing on that side, as well.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
The leftsided findings raise concern for a structural abnormality on that side.
There were no epileptiform features.
Cystic encephalomalacia of the left basal ganglia extending into the left frontal lobe are likely the sequelae of prior infarct, trauma, surgery.
While there is no evidence of recent infarction, evaluation is limited on CT, and MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3631**]- weighted imaging is recommended if clinically indicated.
Extensive paranasal sinus mucosal thickening as described.
Diffuse bibasilar centrilobular nodules and frank consolidation likely represents an infectious process.
Extensive atherosclerotic calcification.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection fraction 30-40 percent)secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the apical half of the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No large perfusion or ventilation defects.
Low likelihood pulmonary embolism.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2166-6-19**] 5:09 AM REPORT: The patient has a left-sided subclavian line, inserting at the cavoatrial junction.
The degree of left basal opacity has probably continued to improve slightly from prior day.
There is some mild increased density over the left mid lung parenchyma when compared to the right but this is not as marked as on [**6-17**].
[**2166-6-27**] PEG placement: PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: After explanation of the potential risks and benefits of the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy (patient's mother).
Preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm patient and proposed procedure.
Patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.
Coronary artery calcifications are noted.
There is bibasilar atelectasis with additional more patchy areas of airspace disease, some of which are somewhat nodular and may be infectious in etiology.
There is a very prominent right paratracheal lymph node that measures 2.7 x 1.8 cm.
Several smaller subcentimeter lymph nodes are noted in the prevascular/AP window regions.
Several prominent lymph nodes are noted in the left axilla which may be reactive in nature.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver is mildly enlarged measuring approximately 20 cm in sagittal dimension.
There is trace amount of ascites in the abdomen.
There is trace amount of pericholecystic fluid.
There is no definite gallbladder wall thickening.
The small and large bowel are unremarkable.
There is no evidence of colitis or diverticulitis.
Heavy atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aorta, renal arteries, splenic artery and mesenteric arteries.
There is no evidence for intraabdominal abscess.
The urinary bladder is not fully distended, which limits its evaluation.
Small amount of air is present in the urinary bladder likely due to a Foley catheter in place.
There is a rectal tube in place.
No evidence of intraabdominal abscess, colitis, or diverticulitis.
Enlarged main pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension.
Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications involving coronary arteries, aorta, and multiple other intraabdominal vessels.
Mild hepatomegaly and trace amount of ascites.
Residual patchy and somewhat nodular opacities at both lung bases may be infectious in etiology.
Enlarged paratracheal lymph node measuring 2.7x1.8 cm.
A follow- up CT is recommended to assess for interval change if clinically indicated.
There is no extra- or intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation with the common bile duct measuring approximately 4 mm.
The gallbladder was slightly dilatated with moderate wall thickness and there was no evidence of stones or sludge.
IMPRESSION: Cannot include or exclude cholecystitis.
There is a persistent area of increased density at the left lung base consistent with atelectasis and/or consolidation.
DISCHARGE LABS: WBC: 8.2 HCT 23.2 Plt 499 Gluc 80 BUN 14 CREAT 0.7 Na 141 K 3.8 Cl 101 Hc03 36* AG 8 Valproate 24 (from 18)   Brief Hospital Course: 31 yo F with h/o DMI, hemorrhagic CVA in [**2162**] with residual aphasia and R-sided hemiparesis, and recurrent aspiration PNAs who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from OSH for presumed sepsis, ARF, and respiratory failure.
Now with difficulty extubating.
Respiratory distress:  Mostly likely etiology is aspiration pneumonia v. acute pnumonitis.
Pt had a bronchial lavage culture from [**6-17**] that is pending; no organism were seen on gram stain.
She was also being diuresed, initially with Lasix gtt then boluses) as tolerated by her renal function.
Pt also got a V/Q scan that showed low likelihood for PE.
Of note, pt tends to have a high RSBI which may not be absolutely indicative of ability to ween.
Causes for failure to extubate include (aspiration) pneumonia, diaphragm atrophy, neurological (R-sided hemiparesis), excess secretions (stridor heard during extubation), hyperthyroid-induced myopathy?.
These were limited by tachypnea and low tidal volumes.
Diuresis should be maintained as the patient has persistent lower extremity edema and improved respiratory status with diuresis.
She had had decreased output to the lasix on last day of admission, and bumex could be considered with thiazide to improve diuresis.
Pt did pull trach out the night prior to discharge, but it was immediately replaced and there were no complications.
Persistent fevers:  Patient started spiking fevers on [**2166-6-24**].
The cause was unclear and possibly initially due to infection as patient had pneumonia and then eventually thought to be due to drug fever also.
She continued to have growth from her sputum cultures.
Eosinophilia developed over several days as well as urine eosinophils.
This suggested that her persistent fevers may have been due to medications.
DMI:  Initially despite insulin gtt, pt tends to have labile blood sugars.
The patient did have more elevated sugars late in the day.
Seizure:  Pt has h/o seizure per OSH records.
She was evaluated by neurology and felt not to have signs of seizure activity.
She again had abdominal pain but a normal CT abdomen, pelvis.
She continued to have discomfort and an abdominal ultrasound was inconclusive.
Pt was on metoclopramide for gastroparesis [**1-10**] DMI, but this was discontinued in the concern that this was causing fevers.
Chronic anemia:  She had persistent anemia and occasionally required transfusions to keep her hct above 21.
Cause of continued anemia is thought due to chronic disease and frequent blood draws (iatrogenic) in the setting of persistent fevers.
Depression:  Stable on fluoxetine initially, as above this was stopped in an attempt to determine the cause of her fevers.
However, this should be restarted if patient remains afebrile on a trial basis.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Six (6) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia Prolonged intubation, tracheostomy Secondary: Diabetes type I, history of stroke with residual hemiparesis, volume overload, hypothyroidism, depression, anemia, possible seizure disorder   Discharge Condition: afebrile, vital signs stable   Discharge Instructions: Patient was admitted with pneumonia that was complicated by prolonged intubation and eventual tracheostomy placement.
Additionally she had fevers that resulted in extensive workup and were determined to eventually be secondary to medications.
She should return to the ER if she has chest pain, shortness of breath, persistent fevers, chills, hypoxia or any other concerning symptoms.
