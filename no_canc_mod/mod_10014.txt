On the floor the patient had continued modifications of his congestive heart failure regimen with his Lasix dose eventually decreased to 80 mg p.o.
The patient's hyponatremia responded well to fluid restriction to one liter per day.
The patient had a PICC line placed on [**2139-5-22**] without complications.
While on the floor it was observed that the patient had three episodes of seven to eight beats of NSVT (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) with no symptoms.
Given the fact that he has very mild coronary artery disease and is symptom free, despite his low ejection fraction, EP consultants felt that there is no indication for electrical mapping of the ventricles and possible placement of an AICD at this point.
Congestive heart failure secondary to cardiomyopathy         of unclear etiology, viral versus idiopathic of 10         to 15 percent at time of discharge with left         ventricular dilatation.
MRSA bacteremia with negative surveillance culture         on Vancomycin and Gentamicin.
Mild hyponatremia resolving with fluid restriction         with serum and urine osmolality suggestive of         antidiuretic hormone action.
No         thrombotic complications observed clinically.
