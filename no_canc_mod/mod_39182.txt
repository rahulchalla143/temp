MESENTERIC ANGIOGRAM [**2116-1-10**] 7:38 AM IMPRESSION: Active extravasation from the peripheral branch of the inferior mesenteric artery, which was successfully embolized.
No active extravasation in the digital subtraction angiography from the superior mesenteric artery.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo F h/o HTN, diverticulitis s/p partial colectomy p/w bright red blood per ostomy consistent with new diverticular bleed and comfirmed on CTA.
She was taken to Interventional Radiology and 4 coils were placed to a small branch of her left colic artery.
Patient with likely diverticular bleeding based on the fact that she has had perforated diverticulitis s/o left hemicolectomy with colostomy.
However the patient has never had a colonoscopy so other etiologies of lower GI bleed can not be completely ruled out.
She should have a colonoscopy as an outpatient to assess for other sources of bleeding (malignancy, AVM, ulcerated polyps...) She has a colonoscopy scheduled in [**2116-1-30**].
# HTN: Initially held blood pressure medications in setting of active GI bleed.
# CONTRAST NEPHROPATHY: baseline cr 1.3, and was stable on presentation.
INACTIVE PROBLEMS # Diabetes: Insulin dependent diabetic.
