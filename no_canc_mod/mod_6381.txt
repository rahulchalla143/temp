Admission Date:  [**2101-9-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-10-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2039-8-28**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Location (un) **] Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old female with a past medical history significant for diabetes Type 2, panhypopituitarism, status post resection, multiple prior episodes of hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism, end stage renal disease, hemodialysis dependent, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction less than 20% and coronary artery disease who presented after being found unresponsive at home with a fingerstick of 22.
The patient was noted to be incontinent of stool with guaiac positive stool.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was essentially negative with the exception of diarrhea, negative for lightheadedness, negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, melena, bright red [**Location (un) **] per rectum, abdominal pain, positive for diarrhea for several days.
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular was notable for regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Abdominal examination, abdomen was soft but distended with mild periumbilical tenderness and positive bowel sounds.
Extremities were 1+ edema, nonpitting, positive chronic venous stasis changes, positive ichthyosis.
Diabetes mellitus #2, controlled by diet for the last two to three years; 2.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed in [**2101-5-31**] diagnosed with esophagitis, esophageal ulcer and gastritis; 3.
Hypoglycemia, four admissions for hypoglycemia this year with likely Glucagon response, unclear etiology; 4.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis times seven to eight years; 5.
Hypothyroidism controlled on Levothyroxine secondary to pituitary adenoma resection; 6.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20%; 8.
History of gastroesophageal reflux disease; 10.
Hemosiderosis diagnosed in [**2101-3-31**] on abdominal magnetic resonance imaging scan likely affecting her liver and ?
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
The patient is separated from her husband and has no children secondary to inability to conceive.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for numerous first degree relatives from her mother's side with diabetes mellitus.
Chest x-ray showed no pneumonia or congestive heart failure on admission.
This occurred in the setting of not taking her Prednisone for at least one week secondary to possible cause issues, likely social issues related to her sister and her inability to consistently supply Ms [**Known lastname 26868**] with her medications.
Given the setting of hypoglycemia she was maintained on a D10 drip originally at 35 cc/hr.
Etiology of her hypoglycemia was not known.
The differential diagnosis includes insulinoma and secondary phase of insulin response per Endocrine.
Hypoglycemia - After the patient was transferred to the floor she was eating well and was quickly weaned off of her D10 requiring no insulin coverage and no supplementary glucose with normal meals according to the hospital schedule.
The patient was maintained on a renal diet for the remainder of the admission, again no episodes of hypoglycemia.
In addition she was offered peanut butter sandwiches intermittently for nighttime snacks as high carbohydrate snacks without protein or fat, more likely to cause delayed insulin peak resulting in hypoglycemia during the night.
The patient was originally loathe to participate as she did not want to endure any more pain and was unwilling to undergo surgery, but given that she knows she will be anesthetized for this procedure and there is medical management available for insulinoma, she will undergo this procedure.
Hypotension - The patient has been very labile the beginning of admission, responsive to fluids, clinically dry.
Diarrhea - The patient was spitting up [**Month (only) **] with a positive nasogastric lavage on admission.
Her diarrhea etiology was unclear, screening for ova and parasites culture and Clostridium difficile was negative times two.
The patient clearly had an upper gastrointestinal bleed on admission with coffee ground emesis, but she had a stable hematocrit with guaiac positive brown stool.
proton pump inhibitor, given that her hematocrit climbed rather than fell, Gastroenterology consult was not called given that this was likely due to chronic gastritis/esophagitis.
The patient never complained of epigastric pain or abdominal pain in general.
Loperamide or Lomotil to help with decreasing stool volume and increasing anal sphincter tone.
It was held off given that we need another negative Clostridium difficile toxin to be certain that this is not the etiology for her chronic diarrhea.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis - The patient underwent hemodialysis three times a week during admission receiving Epogen during the dialysis with a notable increase in her hematocrit.
Panhypopituitarism - Secondary to surgery for pituitary adenoma the patient is maintained on Levothyroxine as well as Prednisone as an outpatient.
As mentioned she had no more hypotension or hypoglycemia after transfer to the floor.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient ate well after transfer to the floor with renal diet with no hypoglycemia.
Congestive heart failure - Likely secondary to both hemosiderosis and coronary artery disease, no clinical findings synonymous with fluid overload at this time, the patient's fluid overload controlled with hemodialysis.
Thrombocytopenia - Unclear etiology, but a chronic issue likely secondary to hepatic failure.
Hypertension - Historical issue for this patient, the patient was hypotensive, she was normotensive throughout the admission.
There was great concern by the visiting nurse that the sister can not take care of the patient and that this was an unsafe situation as the patient has had numerous admissions for hypoglycemia as outlined above.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital3 **] for a [**Hospital 5735**] rehabilitation and hemodialysis and physical therapy.
