Bibasilar opacifications, more prominent on the left, consistent with pleural effusions and compensatory basilar atelectasis.
The upper lung zones are clear and there is no evidence of vascular congestion.
[**2135-6-12**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-11**], allowing for differences in technique, there is probably little change in the bilateral pleural effusions, slightly more prominent on the left.
Basilar atelectatic change is also seen on the left.
[**2135-6-12**] PORTABLE ABDOMEN: No previous images.
There is a relative paucity of bowel gas presenting in a nonspecific pattern.
Although no dilatation of gas-filled loops is seen, the possibility of a dilated fluid-filled bowel loops can certainly not be excluded.
Findings of avascular necrosis are seen in the right femoral head.

On the night of admission he developed acute abdomen and underwent emergent laparotomy.
A 5cm area of deserosalized tissues was found and a small bowel resection performed.
The post-op course was complicated by persistent abdominal pain and intractable nausea and vomiting for ~2 weeks.
#SBP: At about 2 weeks post-op the patient developed increased abdominal pain.
He continued to have abdominal pain and a repeat diagnostic paracentesis was done 2 days after initiation of treatment.
This revealed a WBC of 5300 with 50% neutrophils indicating persistent infection despite treatment.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was persistently tachypneic to the mid 20s throughout his hospitalization.
On the morning of  [**7-15**] he was found to be tachypneic to 30s, using accesory muscles and had cough blood tinged sputum.
His respiratory status improved with diuresis and CXR showed persistent left pleural effusion that was unchanged.
That afternoon the patient again developed respiratory distress and was transferred to the MICU with increased work of breathing and after failing a trial of NPPV, he was intubated on [**7-15**].
He has known shunting from hepatopulmonary syndrome, and also has V/Q mismatch from a large, stable left pleural effusion and ascites.
Given the patient's increased work of breathing and minute ventilation, there was concern for increased Vd/Vt suggestive of either worsening V/Q mismatch from increased pulmonary edema or increased shunting from a pulmonary emboli.
His hepatopulmonary syndrome, ascites, and left pleural effusion appeared stable, contributing to decreased pulmonary reserve but likely not contributing to acute decompensation.
CXR on [**7-15**] revealed new R sided effusion, new R sided parenchymal opacities, old L sided effusion.
However, sputum subsequently grew out rare oropharingeal flora and [**Last Name (LF) 23087**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] these antibiotics were discontinued.
Thus, it was concluded that CT and CXR changes were likely due to increased pulmonary edema likely secondary to acute on sub-acute renal failure and oliguria in the setting of receiving volume.
He subsequently developed a low grade fever and leukocytosis by [**7-22**] and was pancultured, with cultures pending; an IR paracentesis was also scheduled.
CXR from [**7-22**] showed stable LLL atelectasis with layering of a moderate L pleural effusion and improved right multifocal airspace opacities and pulmonary edema (now mild).
Once his Cr stabilized at low 2s he was started on diuretics to treat his fluid overload.
It was thought that  this acute decompensation might have also had a component of HRS and ATN.
He was treated for HRS with minimal improvement.
He was started on CVVH on [**7-15**] to treat his fluid overload as above.
During his hospitalization he was evaluated by the transplant nephrology team who concluded that his renal failure was likely due to his post-infectious GN with a component of ATN and so he initially did not qualify at the moment for liver-kidney transplant.
However, Mr. [**Known lastname 40167**] continued to require Hemodialysis at the end of his hospitalization and ultimately was HLA typed and screened for renal transplant.
At time of discharge, patient was listed for both liver and renal transplant.
His anemia was thought to be due to renal failure.
#L pleural effusion: The patient was found to have a persistent left pleural effusion and that was causing  mild left lower collapse and contributing to his chronic respiratory distress.
He underwent  U/S guided thoracentesis by IR and a total 1.7 L was taken out.
Pulmonary was consulted and they concluded that this was due part to his ESLD  with a component of nephrotic syndrome.
#Abdominal Pain: Patient had persistent abdominal pain throughout admission.
He received multiple abdominal CT that never revealed an acute process.
It revealed an EF 70%, a hyperdynamic LV and pulmonary HTN.
This revealed PCWP of 22 mmHg, elevated right sided filling pressure at 15 mmHg and moderate pulmonary HTN of PASP of 44 mmHg.
He was diagnosed with type 1 pulmonary hypertension caused by his ESLD and nephrotic syndrome.
#Sinus Tachycardia: Patient  was persistently in sinus tachycardia to low 100s.
His EKG revealed no abnormalities.
Right Heart Cath showed Pulmonary HTN.
# S/p Liver Transplant: Patient is s/p liver transplant at age 4 because of biliary atresia.
He was re-evaluated and thought to be a candidate for re-transplantation.
# Fever: Patient had a fever while on Vanc and Zosyn as well as eosinophilia.
There was concern for drug fever and antibiotics were discontinued.
He continued to have occasionaly low-grade fevers with no source identified.
# Eosinophilia - Noted during the end of his admission.
Thought likely secondary to antibiotics or other medication.
Pending results for HISTOPLASMA ANTIBODY (BY CF AND ID), SCHISTOSOMA ANTIBODIES, and STRONGYLOIDES ANTIBODY,IGG were pending at discharge to be followed up.

Respiratory Failure 4.

During the operation a small portion of your bowel was removed due to concern that there was a hole in the bowel wall causing stool to leak into your abdomen.
This is an antibiotic which helps to prevent future infections in your abdomen.
Additionally, during your admission, you had problems with your breathing and were sent to the intensive care unit and required a machine to breathe for you.
Additionally, you had problems with your kidneys that required hemodialysis, which will continue ([**Date Range 766**], Wednesday, and Fridays) once you leave the hospital.
You were also given a medication called ivermectin in case you have a parasitic infection.
Please return to the ER or call your doctor if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, severe nausea/vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal pain, fevers, chills, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
