She was noted to have a mildly elevated white count of 13.6K.
A presumptive diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made, and she was admitted to the surgical service.
She had increased RUQ pain the morning of [**5-24**], and then triggered the night of [**5-24**] for tachycardia to the 140's and hypoxia to 80% on room air.
Second set was elevated as well (T 0.22, CK 103).
The morning of admission, she again triggered for hypotension (80/46), heart rate 56.
Per the family, she had been complaining of back pain   She had been admitted twice within the past year for choledocholithiasis ([**8-/2162**] with two 8-10mm stones in CBD, sphincterotomy/stent but no stone extractions; [**11/2162**] stone extraction and stent removed).

Evidence of acute cholecystitis, with progression of inflammation since [**5-22**].
There is increased distention, wall thickening and stranding, and at least one intraluminal stone is seen.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
An intraluminal oval rounded hypodense structure is seen near the junction of the second and third portions of the duodenum, previously hyperdense on a contrast-enhanced study (and therefore possibly enhancing).
There is no upstream duodenal dilation to suggest obstruction.
The differential diagnosis includes atypical food particles/debris (if not truly enhancing), polyp (if enhancing) and neuroendocrine tumor is not excluded.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
Circumscribed fluid attenuation structure in the right hilar region as described, likely representing a pericardial cyst.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate to severe hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferior wall, inferolateral wall and apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Mild aortic and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

cholecystitis, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension, hypoxia, elevated white count.
#) Cholecystitis: Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] has a history of choledocholothiasis, and she had 2 ERCP procedures in [**2162**] with no complications.
She presented on [**5-22**] with symptoms of anorexia, vomiting, R-sided abdominal pain, and CT scan and U/S reports concerning for acute cholecystitis.
Over the course of her hospitalization, Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] improved clinically with her abdominal pain resolving and improving LFTs.
#) Sepsis: Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] was triggered on [**5-24**] for increasing temperature to 99.5, tachycardic to 140s, and increased O2 requirement, as well as hypotenstion.,  She was found to be bacteremic with positive cultures growing Gram positive Strep milleri.
She had a CT torso to evaluate for source of infection, which showed worsening cholecystitis.
Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] also underwent an echocardiogram to evaluate for endocarditis in the setting of bactermia.
She was found to have a thickend mitral valve leaflet.
It was decided that she would not be a good candidate for further imaging with trans-esophageal echocardiogram, so she will be treated for a 6-week course of antibiotics for presumed endocarditis based on TTE.
#) Respiratory failure: Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] required intubation secondary to respiratoy failure in the setting of sepsis and NSTEMI.
#) NSTEMI:  Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] suffered NSTEMI while septic secondary to increased demand.
Echo showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, mild aortic and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Her creatinine improved with fluid resuscitation and treatment of infection to 1.1 at time of discharge.
#) Back pain: While on the floor, Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] reported back pain but was unable to localize location, did not have point tenderness, and no neurologic deficits.
The posibility of epidural abscess from bacterial seeding was discussed, but unlikely given exam findings.
MRI should be considered for further evaluation if she has hemodynamic decline or develops neurologic deficits.
Her current planned treatment with 6 weeks of targeted antibiotics would be appropriate for discitis/osteomyelitis as well.
We were also concerned that this pain was recurring in the setting of cholecystitis, but we were treating with antibiotics and already determined that she was a poor candidate for surgical intervention.

Morphine 15 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for pain: breakthrough pain only, hold for sedation, RR<10 or confusion.
Cholecystitis  Secondary diagnosis 2.

Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: stable, breathing comfortably on 2L/NC, sleepy but arousable and conversant   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for cholecystitis (infection of the gall bladder), and this was complicated by a blood infection.
Likely because of this infection, you had low blood pressures and difficulty breathing.
Also because of your infection and low blood pressues, you experienced a small heart attack while you were in the hospital.
We also saw evidence of possible infection in your heart valves.
If you develop worsening shortness of breath, difficlty breathing, low blood pressures with systolic <90, fevers >101 degrees, or any other concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention immediately.
