The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) with noted hypokinesis of the apical anterior segment and apex.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen with provocative maneuvers (Trendelenberg and phenylephrine bolus).
There is mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is noted after mitral valve annuloplasty.
Biventricular function is unchanged LVEF 40%, no new wall motion abnormalities are noted.
No pneumothorax.
Some residual atelectatic changes at the left and possibly also right bases.
Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation is unchanged.
CO-SURGEONS:  [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10585**], MD  ASSISTANT:  [**Name6 (MD) 59497**] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD [**First Name (Titles) 59498**] [**Last Name (Titles) 59499**], MD [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 50417**], Intern  ANESTHESIOLOGIST:  [**Name6 (MD) 59500**] [**Name8 (MD) 3893**], MD  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease, moderate mitral regurgitation.
BRIEF HISTORY:  This is a 76 year-old female patient, known coronary artery disease with recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction on [**12-17**].
She was also known to have mitral regurgitation with medical management.
Recently, her symptoms increased and surgery was advised.
FINDINGS:  Her coronary angiograms showed an 80% stenosis of the left anterior descending.
Intraoperative echo showed a moderate mitral regurgitation.
The patient was cannulated with an ascending aortic cannula in the distal ascending aorta and a 3 stage venous cannula into the right atrium.
The sutures were tied and on testing once again, there was no central jet.
During the cross clamp time, a further 400 ml of cold blood cardioplegia was given through the antegrade cannula.
There was diffuse disease and the internal mammary artery was then anastomosed end-to- side using 8-0 Prolene.
For a brief period, the EKG showed an ischemic pattern of the inferior leads; however, this reverted back to baseline.
[**MD Number(1) 1288**]   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2190-2-16**] and taken to the operating room where she underwent single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting and a mitral valve repair.
She was started on coumadin and amiodarone for rate controlled atrial fibrillation.
She became confused and was started on Haldol and required a 1:1 sitter.
Her INR became supratherapeutic and she was given FFP and vitamin K.  Her confusion resolved and her INR came down to 1.3.
Discharge Instructions: Call with fever, redness or drainage from incision or weight gain more than 2 pounds in one day or five in one week.
Shower, no baths, no lotions, creams or powders to incisions.
