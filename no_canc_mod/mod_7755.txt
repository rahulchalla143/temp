Admission Date:  [**2128-1-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-2-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: slow responses, right sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: thoracentesis nasogastric tube placement  History of Present Illness: 86yo right handed man with PMH significant for uncontrolled HTN and hyperlipidemia who was in his USOH the night of presentation when he walked to the restroom at 8:30pm.
He then sat on the couch but when his wife called to him to come to dinner, he was slow to respond, stood but could not walk due to right-sided weakness and his speech was slurred.
She gave him a series of commands which he performed but his response time was significantly slowed and she had difficulty understanding his speech.
He is now transferred here after CT of the head at OSH showed a 2.5cm x 2.4cm left thalamic ICH with slight rupture into the ventricle.
On presentation to [**Location (un) 620**], he was hypertensive to 231/88 and he was given lopressor, to lower his pressure to the current level of 204/64.
Wife brought in letter stating the belief that he has a problem with "red cell production" HTN x [**3-18**] yrs, often uncontrolled to 200's hyperlipidemia GERD ankylosing spondylitis L ICA carotid stenosis (complete occlusion) h/o tuberculosis "in his neck", s/p multidrug treatment x 6mos no MI, CAD, or stroke  Social History: Lives with his wife, retired SBO.

Increased opacity involving the right lung may represent scarring versus atelectasis.
Comparison with previous radiographs would help to better assess for long-term interval change.
Loculated left-sided pleural effusion.
Increased air space opacity involving the left mid and lower lung is less conspicuous than seen previously.
Diagnostic considerations include asymmetric pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
Chest CT: Small right and moderate left pleural effusions, probably not transudate, greater and maybe loculated in the left side.
Peripheral consolidation in the right upper lobe, largely scarring, but peribronchial thickening in the lower lobes, could be chronic or subacute infection.
Fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the suprarrenal abdominal aorta.
There is interval increase in a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.
There is no new mass effect, hydrocephalus, or major vascular territorial infarction.
Mucosal thickening is seen in the sphenoid sinus.
Repeat [**1-27**]: The left thalamic hemorrhage has decreased in size.
There has been an increase in the amount of intraventricular blood.
L LENI: No evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
Normal gallbladder and no biliary ductal dilatation.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 86yo man with PMH significant for HTN presents with dysarthria and subtle right-sided weakness, along with delayed response time cognitively, and was found to have left thalamic bleed with slight extension into the ventricle, likely secondary to hypertension.
His hospital course was complicated by multiple medical problems as detailed below.
He was eventually transferred to the MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, made DNR/DNI and expired.
His exam remained unchanged with severe dysarthria, slight right hemiparesis, and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status most likely secondary to metabolic encephalopathy (see medical problems listed below).
2. hypertension - His blood pressure remained poorly controlled initially: metoprolol was initiated but was ineffective.
ACE inhibitor was not started due to mild acute renal failure.
3. respiratory difficulties - Due to his bulbar weakness, the patient was unable to clear his secretions.
A CXR on admission showed a loculated pleural effusion on the left, which was not seen on previous x-rays.
The pulmonary service was consulted, and performed a diagnostic thoracentesis, which was consistent with a transudative effusion.
A chest CT showed emphysematous changes.
He continued to decline and developed hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring transfer to the MICU.
4. elevated alkaline phos - His alk phos remained elevated during his hospitalization.
This may be secondary to his ankylosing spondylitis, but was rather high for this explanation.
?cellulitis - He was initially treated for concern for L foot cellulitis with cefazolin.
6. renal failure - He was noted to have rising creatinine and BUN during the beginning of his hospital stay, with low UOP at times.
FeNa was 0.22% and urine eosinophils were negative, no hydronephrosis on abdominal ultrasound.
FEN - He failed his speech and swallow.
Code Status - Pt was made DNR/DNI by his family after worsening neurologic deficits manifested in the setting of respiratory failure.
Renal failure.
