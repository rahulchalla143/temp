Admission Date: [**2149-7-25**]        Discharge Date: [**2149-8-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2149-7-25**]        Sex:  F  Service:  NEONATOLOGY  IDENTIFICATION:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 724**] is a 22 day old former 33 [**1-22**] week premature infant with presumed hemolytic anemia who is being discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] NICU.
Past maternal medical history notable for depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and anorexia (on fluoxetine 80 mg per day and lorazepam 0.5 mg per day).
ANTENATAL HISTORY: Pregnancy complicated by IUGR (10th percentile) secondary to placental insufficiency with absent end-diastolic flow, by borderline ventriculomegaly on a recent ultrasound, and by mild preeclampsia.
There was no labor and no intrapartum fever, or other clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis.
There were no intrapartum antibiotics administered.
Infant emerged with good tone but was apneic with well-maintained heart rate.
At that point, respirations were shallow with moderate intercostal retractions, but these normalized over the next 5 minutes.
She has had no episodes of apnea or bradycardia of prematurity.
However, persistent hyperbilirubinemia was noted with values of 8/0.3 on day of life 13 and 10/0.4 on day of life 18, requiring two additional several day courses of phototherapy.
Due to persistent hyperbilirubinemia as described above, evaluation for hemolysis was undertaken.
Overall findings were thought to suggest a mild hemolytic anemia, perhaps secondary to enzymatic defect such as G6PD deficiency or a membrane defect.
Parents are to have blood samples drawn at [**Hospital1 18**] laboratory for CBC and RBC smear for review by hematology, and infant and family should follow-up with hematology at [**Hospital1 **] in two weeks (hematology fellow: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11818**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 75048**], hematology clinic [**Telephone/Fax (1) 47801**], CH page operator [**Telephone/Fax (1) 53567**]).
NEURO: Head ultrasound on day of life #7 was within normal limits without evidence of ventriculomegaly.
Breath sounds clear and equal in room air with slight retractions and comfortable respirations.
No audible murmur.
Abdomen soft and rounded with active bowel sounds, no masses.
Slightly jaundiced.
Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from     [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the     following 4 criteria: 1) Born at less than 32 weeks; 2)     Born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of the following:     Daycare during RSV season, a smoker in the household,     neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school-     aged siblings; 3) Chronic lungs disease; or 4)     Hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of a child's     life, immunization against influenza is recommended for     household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
The     American Academy of Pediatrics recommended initial     vaccination of preterm infants at or following discharge     from the hospital if they are clinically stable and at     least 6 weeks but fewer than 12 weeks of age.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Premature infant born at 33-3/37 week gestation, symmetrically intrauterine growth restriction, rule out sepsis, hyperbilirubinemia, hemolytic anemia.
