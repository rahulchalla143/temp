Admission Date:  [**2117-2-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-2-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-1-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**] Chief Complaint: hypoxia, hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated and mechanically ventialted.
[**2117-2-19**] - Extubation and discontinuation of mechanical ventilation [**2117-2-18**] - Bedside bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage   History of Present Illness: This is a 69 year-old Female with oxygen-dependent COPD, CAD, diastolic CHF, mitral stenosis, IDDM, HTN, HLD who presented to an [**Hospital6 7472**] ED on [**2117-2-10**] with acute hypoxic respiratory failure with oxygen saturations in the 81-85% on 2L NC and hypotension.
Her partner states that she had been feeling unwell for several days prior to this with fatigue, chills, one an episode of non-bloody emesis, "indigestion," decreased urine output, and back pain.
In the OSH ED, she was found to have acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.9 (baseline 0.6).
A CXR showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.
Her previous hospital course was complicated by an episode of hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, and she was intubated on [**2-13**] prior to bronchoscopy.
She underwent a fiber-optic bronchscopy on [**2-13**] which showed clear tenacious secretions in the left mainstem, persistent bronchomalacia of the left mainsten, a stenosis of right middle lobe oriface.
Biopsies showed acute inflammation and revealed no malignancy.
She had an asystolic event with CPR and ROSC on [**2-14**] thought to be due to mucous plugging, resulting in re-intubation ([**2117-2-14**]).
The etiology of this event was thought to be pulmonary in origin.
She also underwent CT abdominal imaging on [**2117-2-10**] given her back pain complaints on admission and known cardiovascular disease, which showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and a left adrenal adenoma without AAA.
CT chest imaging showed no pulmonary embolism, no aortic dissection, but was notable for bilateral pleural effusions.
There was high grade stenosis at the level of the SMA.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2117-2-17**] for involvement of interventional pulmonology given her bronchiomalacia and cardiology consult for her worsening mitral stenosis, and further work-up of of her renal failure.
A 2D-Echo demonstrated severe mitral annular calcification with mild stenosis and regurgitation, moderate to severe pulmonary HTN (PASP 58 mmHg) with a preserved LVEF of 55%.
A bronchoscopy was performed on [**2117-2-18**] showing COPD, accessory cardiac bronchus, no focal stenosis.
BAL showed 3+ PMNs, 1+ GPCs in pairs and clusters with commensal respiratory flora speciated.
Cardiac biomakers revealed a mild Troponin leak with flat CK-MBs.
She received Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer and has been -5.7L for length-of-stay fluid balance.
Of note, has intermittent episodes of discomfort, anxiety and bronchospasm with a history of mucus plugging.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (baseline on [**2-18**].5L NC with baseline saturations in the 90-93% range; has had episodes of hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation in the past) - question of bronchomalacia 2.
Moderate mitral stenosis (severe annular mitral valve calcification with LAE; last 2D-Echo [**2117-2-19**], MV gradient 8 mmHg, 1+ MR, functional MS) 3.
Congestive heart failure with preserved EF (attributed to mitral stenosis, diastolic dysfunction) 4.

MICROBIOLOGY DATA: [**2117-2-17**] Blood culture - negative [**2117-2-17**] MRSA screen - negative [**2117-2-18**] Bronchoalveolar lavage - 3+ PMNs, 1+ GPC pairs, cluster, > 100K commensal respiratory flora [**2117-2-18**] Bronchial washings - negative for malignant cells .
IMAGING: [**2117-2-19**] 2D-ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF > 55%).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 7 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Calcific mitral valve disease with mild stenosis and at least mild regurgitation.
Mild symmetric LVH with normal global and regional systolic function.
Dilated right ventricle with preserved systolic function.
Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
There is continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases.
An area of increased opacification that is more confluent in the mid-lung on the right could reflect atelectasis or pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 69F with a PMH significant for oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2L NC at home), coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin, and hypertension admitted to OSH with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern for bronchomalacia requiring stenting.
#ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE/CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE EXACERBATION/ACUTE-on-CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE/PNEUMONIA: Patient was transferred from [**Last Name (un) 91880**] Hospital following intubation for respiratory failure and concern for bronchomalacia as significant contributor (bronch there showed clear tenacious secretions in the left mainstem, persistent bronchomalacia of the left mainsten, and stenosis of right middle lobe oriface - biopsies revealed no malignancy).
She underwent bronchoscopy just prior to extubation which did not show stenosis and BAL fluid grew only commensal flora after abx.
She was extubated and completed treatement with a course of Vancomycin for 14 days as well as started on a prednisone taper given likely exacerbation of COPD as a contributor to respiratory failure.
She also endorsed increased lower extremity swelling and increased abdominal girth in the month leading up to hospitalization along with weight gain and it was felt that worsening diastolic heart failure was a significant contributor to her respiratory symptoms.
A repeat 2D-Echo showed preserved EF with mild symmetric LVH and severe mitral annulus calcification but only mild mitral stenosis and 1+ MR and pulmonary HTN.
She was diuresed aggressively to a weight of 74kg on discharge with improvement in her respiratory symptoms (although not completely back to her baseline respiratory function-on 3L O2 by NC instead of usual 2L).
She was continued on her home BB/ACEI as well as COPD bronchodilators and inhaled steroid.
She was discharged to follow up with her Cardiologist, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Pulmonologist for f/u of her COPD, heart failure, and renal function and to assess the need for any changes to her diuretic and COPD regimen.
#Type 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ON INSULIN - The patient has known IDDM and her home glucose range is noted to be 60-180s mg/dL, per the patient.
Consider outpatient evaluation of MR, MS, diastolic heart failure and CAD with Cardiology - no acute indications for balloon valvuloplasty at this time (prefers to see [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 91881**], MD) 2.
