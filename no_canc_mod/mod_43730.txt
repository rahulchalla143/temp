Admission Date:  [**2178-3-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-3-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-8-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: chest discomfort and palpitations  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intra aortic balloon pump   History of Present Illness: This is a 60 year old male with prior history of 2 vessel coronary artery disease s/p 5 DES(3 to LAD and 2 to D1 in [**2170**]) who woke up on [**2178-3-11**] with chest discomfort and palpitations.
Associated symptoms included nausea, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, and acute lower extremity edema, with associated shortness of breath.
He presented to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED where he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with heart rates in the 160s.
He was started on IV diltiazem drip for afib with RVR and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**].
Given a positive D-dimer, a V/Q scan was ordered in setting of his renal failure, which was negative.
Troponins were negative; EKG revealed LVH and T wave inversions in V4-V6.
He was hypertensive to 200/100s; a nitro drip was started in addition to diltiazem.
Initially was hypoxemic and was placed on non-rebreather and then was weaned to 5-6 L NC with saturations in the mid 90s.
CXR revealed vascular congestion.
He was started on lasix boluses and was empirically treated for PE with IV heparin until V/Q scan was negative.
In the setting of acute congestive heart failure, a 2D echo was obtained which revealed severe MR, severe elevation of PA pressures (39 mm Hg) and tricuspid regurgitation.
The cause for acute MR was mysterious.
Coronary angiography was not performed due to renal failure.
At time of transfer to CCU, he was additionally started on nitro drip and continued on lasix drip for his pulmonary edema and further afterload reduction.
Past Medical History: HTN for 6yrs on lisinopril for last 8months changed from cozaar and norvasc b/c of cost- no follow up labs- was due for followup physical next week  Social History: electrical contractor, 1drink every 2weeks, 10pack yr smoking hx quit 2weeks ago, no IVDU   Family History: Dad died of stroke at age 76 and mother died of MI at 73, sister dies at 13 from birth defects  Physical Exam: VS: T=98.0 BP=145-164/76-127 HR=93-105 RR=[**10-25**] O2 sat=93-95 NC 6L GENERAL: Lying in bed, fatigued, hair matted, responsive to questions and appropriate.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
NECK: Supple with JVP difficult to assess with patient lying flat, no carotid bruits CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space.
murmurs difficult to assess secondary to aortic balloon pump sound LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Clear to auscultation in anterior lung fields, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: Upper and lower extremities warm to touch, [**1-8**]+ pitting edema to the ankles bilaterally with trace-1+ edema to the upper 2/3rds of his shins.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
[**2178-3-12**] ECHO IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and low normal global systolic function.
Increased left ventricular filling pressure.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
At least moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
Elevated left-sided filling pressures.
Successful placement of Fiberoptix 40 cc intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) under flouroscopic guidance without complications via R femoral artery.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed two-vessel disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypertenstion with a central aortic pressure of 151/105 mmHg.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
[**3-18**] ECHO IMPRESSION: Spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium and left atrial appendage with probable thrombus in the left atrial appendage.
Mildly thickened mitral valve with mild prolapse of A1 scallop and tethering of portions of the anterior and posterior leaflets.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Extensive complex, mobile atheroma in the thoracic aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 year old man with acute onset of symptoms who presented to the ED with no signs of ACS and found to have new 4+ MR, 2+ TR and Volume overload.
# Acute mitral regurgitation: Likely etiology of his decompensated CHF.
Ischemic event thought to be unlikely given onset of symptoms > 24 hrs with no troponin or CK elevation; EKG reveals T wave inversions in V4-V6 which are likely in setting of LVH.
Chest pain free on admission.
Other possibilities for acute MR included: (1) spontaneous rupture (2) infective endocarditis (3) myxomatous disease, ie.
mitral valve prolapse (4) severe ischemia without cardiac necrosis.
On [**3-14**] he developed a fever 100.4 and his IABP was removed on [**3-15**], however he then developed absent right distal pulses and his right foot began to feel numb.
Although his leg remained cool, he did not have pain or sig numbness.
His pulses became dopplerable on [**3-17**].
# Decompensated CHF - As noted above, in setting of acute MR pt had significant Pulmonary edema seen on CXR, elevated JVP and lower extremity edema with new O2 requirement.
# Acute TR: was thought to be secondary to acute MR and increased pressure build up causing tricuspid regurgitation during RV contraction.
# Hypertension: Pt was hypertensive on admission with Systolics in the 200's.
Unclear whether he had been hypertensive at baseline, but likely a response to his acute heart failure poor forward flow [**1-7**] mitral regurgitation and increased SVR.
# Renal failure: Pt may have some underlying renal disease with baseline slightly higher than 1.2 ([**2170**]).
However, FeUrea of 67% was consistent with ATN in the setting of acute MR and poor renal perfusion.

You developed mitral regurgiation, a leaky mitral valve and this led to fluid overload, swelling and shortness of breath.
You also developed atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm.
You will need to weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
The atrial fibrillation increases your risk for a stroke so you have been started on coumadin to prevent blood clots.
Your right leg developed an emboli that has decreased circulation.
