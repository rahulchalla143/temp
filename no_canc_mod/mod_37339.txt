Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 year-old female with a history of morbid obesity s/p gastric bypass, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma who presents with acute on chronic abdominal pain, for which she was discharged on [**2124-2-18**] after a negative evaluation which included abdominal/pelvic CT.  She reported improvement in her abdominal pain, which she describes as sharp, epigastric pain radiating to the RUQ and LUQ, after initiation of laxatives and antitussive agents.
However, she had worsening pain on the day of presentation.
Of note, her family notes that she has been increasing somnolent and confused lately, and has also had decreased po intake.
She was mentating appropriately, A&O x 3, and though her primary complaint was abdominal pain and she described no subjective SOB, fevers, chills, cough, or chest pain, her evaluation focused on her hypoxia.
On exam, she was found to be wheezy with decreased BS bilaterally, and was thought to have an asthma exacerbation, for which she was given nebs, steroids, and azithro 500mg x 1 after blood cx were sent.
A CXR was also performed and was negative for any acute process and no evidence of hyperinflation.
Past Medical History: - morbid obesity s/p hernia repair [**6-1**] and gastric bypass surgery - OSA on nocturnal BIPAP (18/15) and 2-3L home O2 - obesity hypoventilation syndrome - pulmonary HTN thought from OSA and obesity hypoventilation - right heart failure - h/o iron deficiency anemia - asthma: last PFTs in [**4-5**] with marked obstructive defect and FEV1 of 38%.
Also had [**Month (only) **] FVC suggestive of restrictive defect - Hypertension - Osteoarthritis of bilateral knees  Social History: The patient lives with her two sons.

Sinus rhythm.
Right axis deviation.
CXR [**2124-2-21**]: Stable cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension with evidence of right heart failure.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: advanced cor pulmonale  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 58 year old morbidly obese woman with obesity hypoventilation syndrome/OSA/Asthma resulting in marked obstructive lung disease, moderate restrictive lung disease secondary to obesity, and severe pulmonary hypertension and severe right failure.
She presented with acute on subacute abdominal pain, and incidentally was noted to be hypoxic and hypercapnic.
# Hypoxia: The working diagnosis was acute asthma exacerbation with component of pulmonary edema.
Patient also has severe pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale noted on 2D echo.
She was treated for asthma exacerbation in the ICU with short overnight stay.
Her CO2 was noted to be 85 with marked respiratory alkalosis compensating for respiratory acidosis.
VBG showed baseline chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation.
The CXR was unchanged with no focal abnormalities or new effusions.
She had evidence of wheezing on exam.
She was continued on sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension.
# Abdominal pain:  In regards to her abdomina pain, she had recent abdominal CT at [**Hospital1 2025**] and [**Hospital1 18**] with no acute issues found on the CT.
The pain started after coughing and she thought that she had disrupted her mesh.
In [**7-1**] she had a fat necrosis and separation of incision for which she had a complex repair.
However, upon discussion with the radiology team, they felt that an MRI would not reveal any pathology that could not be seen on The CT scan that was already done.
Surgery felt that there was no evidence of hernia on prior CT (recent).
They felt she most likely had muscular pain from coughing.
The patient's pain resolved on its own without any significant intervention  Arrangements were made for pt to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
# Failure to thrive: Patient's family reported she had been having difficulty managing at home (she lives alone), reporting symptoms of somnolence and confusion; there was concern that she was transiently hypercapnic during these episodes.
There was concern that her underlying pulmonary issues were progressing, making her living situation at home more difficult.
# ARF: Creatinines were elevated over the past month to 1.4-1.6.
# PPX:  SC heparin given to prevent DVT .
Her long term prognosis is poor because of her severe pulmonary hypertension.
