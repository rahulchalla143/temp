Admission Date:  [**2179-11-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-11-26**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: Cardiac arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with PMH HTN, Afib s/p pacer now being evaluated s/p presumed Vfib arrest.
History limited but per daughter, pt report USOH with exception of mild increased fatigue, dizziness x several weeks.
Apparently pt was sitting with daughter after lunch when she became unresponsive with "eyes rolled behind" head.
Daughter called 911 and started CPR; no pulse initially.
EMS arrived shortly thereafter and found pt with perfusing rhythm.
Had traumatic intubation in ED, after multiple attempts finally intubated.
Stat bedside echo showed no focal wall motion abnormalities, reported preserved LV function with moderate MR/AI and pulmonary hypertension.
Interrogation of pacer showed Afib with rapid ventricular rate, but unable to locate clear VT/VF episode with the exception of an episode with a rate in 300s.
There was a concern for subcutaneous emphysema in the neck given traumatic intubation.
Chest/neck CT showed perforation of trachea with marked subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum.

?Posturing/syncopal episode: Unclear if secondary to VFA, rapid afib, or brainstem stroke.
Per neuro, findings on neuro exam were worrisome for brainstem injury secondary to hypotensive stroke.
Other possibility is diffuse anoxic brain injury.
Repeat head CT showed no evidence of bleed or mass effect.
Regarding cardiogenic causes of syncope, arrythmia is very likely.
Rapid afib is also a possibility since pt seems to have had episodes of rapid afib around time of syncope.
Pt has valvular abnormalities on echo.
Ischemia unlikely given negative cardiac enzymes.
On HD2, pt became aggitated and was given propofol.
Pt also began to respond to voice and some commands.
However her respiratory status and mental status worsened over the course of the day and following night.
The following day she was re-intubated for respiratory support.
Vtach and rapid afib seen on pacer.
Vtach may be potential cause of cardiac arrest.
On HD2, pt was noted to be tachycardic in the setting of hypotension immediately after being given propofol for agitation.
Pt was restarted on beta-blocker: metoprolol 5mg IV q6h for rate control.
She was continued on Amiodarone and beta blocker (briefly on an Esmolol drip) however her rate was difficult to control with continued afib with RVR.
Pt is most likely volume overloaded from chest x-ray.
On hospital day 4 she was febrile with decreased urine output she was given IV fluids.
Hypotension: On HD2, pt developed hypotension and tachycardia immediately after being given propofol for aggitation.
Unlikely to be septic or in cardiogenic shock.
She later had recurrence of hypotension requiring three pressors for support.
Ischemia is unlikely to be cause of cardiac arrest.
Pt was intubated in the ED, but suffered traumatic intubation.
Trachea was perforated with resulting subcutaneous emphysema and pneumonmediastinum.
She eventually had a neck CT and denied any further pain so that she was cleared from the soft collar.
?Aspiration pneumonia: Given traumatic intubation, pt most likely aspirated gastric contents.
Pt was started on empiric Flagyl and Levo for potential development of aspiration pneumonitis.
Leukocytosis: Pt had elevated WBC of unclear etiology.
Has only had few low grade temps.
GI: Pt has abdominal distension since admission.
