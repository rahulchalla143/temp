Admission Date:  [**2178-12-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-12-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-2-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital3 **] where she was admitted for atypical chest pain and SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Central venous line insertion into R IJ -Multiple attempts at securing arterial access   History of Present Illness: 62F with hx of severe of pulm HTN, CAD s/p DES to Lcx/LAD in [**10/2177**], prior CVA s/p b/l CEA's, PVD, and COPD who was admitted to OSH [**12-23**] for atypical chest pain and SOB.
She ruled out for ACS with by enzymes (MB 8 -> 7 -> 5; Trop 0.06 -> 0.07 -> 0.06) and EKG without acute ischemic changes but was found to have a BNP of 11K on admission.
She was assessed as having severe decompensated R-sided CHF and was diuresed with 40mg IV lasix in the ED but later that day experienced [**9-9**] back pain with desat to the 50's and was transferred to the CCU for close monitoring with HR in the 60's and BP's in the 90's.
She had ECHO on [**12-24**] which showed severe pulmonary hypertension, RV pressure overload, modestly depressed RV function, and LVEF of 55-65%.
Here in the CCU she describes feeling gradually more short of breath over the past 2 months which has become acutely worse in the past 1-2 weeks.
Interestingly, about 1 month ago she was started on sildenafil for treatment of her pulm htn but felt she became more short of breath when taking that medication and stopped taking it about 2 weeks ago when she started feeling acutely more short of breath.
She denies dietary indiscretion, recent illnesses, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, or other symptoms.
According to her family she has never had low back pain as a problem before but the patient states her back pain gets better with positional changes and rubbing.
Also, her baseline daily function has decreased as she is normally able to move around the rooms of house but has not been able to walk more than 10 feet due to shortness of breath in addition to her basleine vascular claudication.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

SKIN: Mild stasis dermatitis changes.
CXR Portable [**12-25**]: IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is present, along with a very small right pleural effusion, decreased since [**9-5**].
Heart size is top normal, and the main pulmonary artery is substantially dilated, as before indicating persistent pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Previous mediastinal adenopathy documented on the chest CT in [**Month (only) 216**] is difficult to assess but probably has not worsened.
No pneumothorax.
Aorta/Branches U/S [**12-25**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
CXR Portable [**12-25**]: Tip of the new right internal jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
No pneumothorax or increase in small right pleural effusion.
Interval increase in mediastinal caliber due to vascular engorgement, and due to elevated central venous pressure, probably a function of biventricular heart failure, reflected mild increase in the heart size, moderate increase in pulmonary edema.
Severe pulmonary atrial enlargement, an indication of marked pulmonary arterial hypertension, aortic valvular calcification, which could be hemodynamically significant (particularly in setting of decreased LV filling), and severe, global coronary calcification were shown on a Chest CT in [**Month (only) 216**] [**2178**], discussed with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30814**] at the time of dictation.
R LENI [**12-26**]: IMPRESSION: Limited assessment of the right lower extremity due to early termination of the examination.
No DVT seen in the examined veins.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with substantial pulmonary arterial enlargement consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension.
There is moderate pulmonary edema as well.
TTE [**12-27**]:The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinisic right ventricular systolic function is more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 62F with hx of severe of pulm HTN, CAD s/p DES to Lcx/LAD in [**10/2177**], prior CVA s/p b/l CEA's, PVD, and [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from OSH for evaluation and management of right-sided diastolic CHF exacerbation with background of severe pulmonary hypertension who rapidly decompensated and passed away despite maximal medical therapy.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: .
# Right-sided Diastolic CHF Exacerbation: Pt with clinical evidence of rales halfway up lung fields, JVD, and peripheral edema on admission with CXR evidence of pulmonary edema and BNP 11,000 at OSH, and ECHO demonstrating fluid overloaded RV with S3 gallop on exam.
She was ruled out for ACS at OSH with negative enzymes and non-ischemic EKG's and was transferred on dopamine drip for pressure support with max O2 on venturi mask in moderate respiratory distress satting in the low 90's.
On arrival to the CCU, R IJ was placed without complications and she was started on sildenafil 20mg QID with the hope that pressor support and vasodilatation of the pulmonary vasculature would increase cardiac output and allow for gentle diuresis.
The CCU team (including the CCU attending) attempted to place an arterial line for better BP monitoring given very severe peripheral vascular disease but this was unsuccesful via the radial aproach.
The anesthesia attending attempted to obtain a L femoral arterial line without success.
A 250 mL NS bolus was given without response and phenylephrine was started at this point.
Given her worseining cardiopulmonary status the CCU team recommended intubation to try to achieve better oxygenation, prevent respiratory colapse and to allow us to manage her worsening heart failure while maintaing a patent airway with adequate oxygenation.
Anesthesia was called at 0000 for non-emergent intubation.
At around 0500 the ventilator began alarming due to high peak/plateau pressures.
This was thought to be due to pulmonary edema as repeated succitioning brought up frothy fluid.
The cause of her rapid decline was unclear but hypothesis of the team included possibly a PE (with suboptimal LENI which was negative).
She has an abdominal ultrasound to look for possible ruptured AAA given report of acute onset low back pain at OSH but this was negative.
# Anuric Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 1.8 on admission with oliguria/near anuria, 0.6-0.7 at baseline.
Thought to be due to her brief hypotensive episode after receiving bolus of 40mg IV lasix at OSH.
# Severe Chronic Pulmonary Hypertension/Cor Pulmonale: Unclear etiology.
Perhaps related to her mild-moderate COPD on CT (although re-assuring spirometry in records) or possibly recurrent embolic phenomena.
She was treated aggressively as above but unfortunately had a poor outcome.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: .
# COPD/Hypoxia: PT with mild-moderate COPD changes on most recent CT chest but with essentially normal PFT's.
Not on any home COPD medications.
No chest pain or discomfort.
# HLD: Stable.
# Severe PVD: Stable.
# NIDDM Complicated by Neuropathy: Stable.
Her team took solace in the fact that she was surrounded by her large, loving family and hopefully felt little pain or suffering in her final hours.
