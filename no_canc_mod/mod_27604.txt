She was reportedly brought to the ED by her husband on account of confusion and behavior change (gradual change over about one week per report).
She was found to be markedly jaundiced and to have evident bleeding from her nose and mouth.
He otherwise denied her having headache, dizziness, weakness, bleeding, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills, cough, runny nose, abdominal pain, dysuria or frequency.
He also denied any depresed mood or suicidal ideation.
No reported intentional ingestion.
She had icteric sclerae.
She had blood in her nose and mouth.
EKG was NSR, no acute ischemic findings.
4units FFP .
Past Medical History: 1. h/o autoimmune hepatitis in fall,[**2122**] Liver Bx at that time c/w autoimmune hepatitis.
2. prior history of cholecystitis and cholelithiasis  Social History: She is a housewife, married with no children.
Denies any smoking, ETOH abuse ([**12-19**] glasses of wine weekly), or other illegal drugs of abuse.
gen: intubated, sedated, non-responsive heent: marked scleral icterus; bright red blood oozing from mouth skin: marked jaundice cv: tachycardic, regular, no m/r/g resp: clear with basilar crackles bilaterally abd: distended, no peritoneal signs, hypoactive bowel sounds; gross melena from rectum ext: trace, symmetric peripheral edema, warm, 2+ peripheral pulses neuro: sedated, not responsive  Pertinent Results: [**2125-2-10**] 03:41PM   ALT(SGPT)-34 AST(SGOT)-139* LD(LDH)-526* ALK PHOS-146* TOT BILI-40.2* [**2125-2-10**] 03:41PM   WBC-12.5* RBC-2.74* HGB-10.3* HCT-27.3* MCV-100* MCH-37.4* MCHC-37.6* RDW-20.0* [**2125-2-10**] 03:41PM   GLUCOSE-166* UREA N-51* CREAT-6.4* SODIUM-143 POTASSIUM-3.0* CHLORIDE-97 TOTAL CO2-17* ANION GAP-32*  Brief Hospital Course: 46yo woman with prior history of autoimmune hepatitis/?NASH now transferred from outside hospital with acute on chronic liver failure, consumptive coagulopathy, and evolving multisystem organ failure.
Although over the course of [**2-11**], patient became more hypoxic likely with a component of non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema from all the blood products as well as aspiration of blood from coagulopathy.
Patient had an additional episode of hemoptysis on HD # 9 with suctioning of copious blood.
A TTE did show moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Liver failure: Likely acute on chronic hepatic failure of unclear etiology, ?
Abdominal ultrasound showed elevated velocities and elevated diastolic flow in the hepatic arteries - ?
liver hyperemia vs a proximal stenosis.
Patient expired due to complications of liver failure.
GI following and no safe indication for endoscopy or empiric tx for varices at this time.
Pt had repeat UGIB on HD#9 with copious fresh blood suctioned from her OG.
After discussion with her husband and the GI service, it was determined that EGD is not indicated and is not keeping with the goals of care at this time.
# Cardiovascular: Pt with tachycardia, hypotension and persistent pressor need, likely multifactorial related to multisystem organ failure, sepsis, and dysautonomia.
Initially weaned off levophed and vasopressin but had persistent BP drop on [**2-18**] and required reinstitution of levophed.
# NEURO: Pt had ICP bolt placed for question of monitoring in setting of acute fulminant liver failure.
Now felt to be acute-on-chronic liver failure, with normal head CT (no evidence of mass or ICH) and no longer needing bolt.
BOWEL WALL EDEMA: CT abdomen with diffuse bowel wall edema, could be related to general anasarca but cannot r/o infection/infarction.
Transplant surgery following but pt is not a candidate for any aggressive intervention.
# Coagulopathy: With clinically evident bleeding from oral mucosa and with melena on exam and positive gastric lavage.
Likely consumptive related to whole disease process.
# Acute Renal Failure: By outside records, had prior normal baseline about 9months ago of 0.9; now presented with Creat of 6.5 and anuric.
