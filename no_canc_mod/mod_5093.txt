He was transferred via ambulence to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital and in route complained of right sided chest discomfort, associated with dyspnea and diaphoreiss.
He subsequently underwen ETT with pMIBI which demonstrated a perfusion deficit at rest and was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and renal artery angiogram.
Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] also reports decreased exercise tolerance over the past several months - previously he would be able to climb several flights of stairs without difficulty; he currently gets extremely dypsneic after 10 steps (<1 flight); no associated CP, N, or diahphoresis.
He denies orthopnea and PND.
He denies history of angina or CAD.

Recent testing: [**2131-4-24**]: Echo showed a normal LV size and function.
[**2131-4-20**]: Nuclear stress test where the patient exercised for 6 minutes 57 seconds on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol stopping due to shortness of breath and leg pain.
He did not develop any arrhythmias or chest pain.
There was a moderate sized reversible perfusion abnormality involving the anteroapical and septal portion left ventricle.
There was also a question of a small reversible abnormality involving the inferolateral portion left ventricle.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD was ectatic proximally and occluded in the mid segment after a small diagonal.
The LCX had a 90% stenosis of the OM1 proximally and a 50% followed by a 70% stenosis in the proximal and mid segment of the OM2.
The RCA had a 90% stenosis in the mid PDA.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly to moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (LVEDP was 18 mm Hg).
There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
No mitral regurgitation was noted.
Bilateral selective renal angiography demonstrated widely patent renal arteries.
Mildly to moderately elevated left sided filling pressures.
No angiographically apparent renal artery stenosis.
Coronary artery disease.
No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Mild symmetric LVH.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
No LV mass/thrombus.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: anterior apex - hypo;  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical anterior hypokinesis.. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated at a maximum of 3.7.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Various lines and tubes have been removed since the prior radiograph, and a very small left apical pneumothorax has developed.
Small pleural effusions and minor bibasilar atelectasis are noted.
These findings are superimposed upon subtle likely more chronic peripheral and basilar interstitial lung disease.
IMPRESSION: Small left pneumothorax following tube removal.
Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.
