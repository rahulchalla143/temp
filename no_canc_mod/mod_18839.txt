The patient denied F/C and reported a chronic productive cough that was unchanged.
The patient underwent cardiac cath that showed: native LMCA and 3 vessel CAD with known chronic total occlusion of the RCA with progression with another subtotal occlusion in the distal AV groove CX with successfull BMS.
The patient had a patent LIMA-LAD with a 75% stenosis in the mid-distal LAD downstream of the anastomosis that was not intervened on.
He had occluded SVG-diagonal.
He received a total of 270ml of dye and was started on a bicarb gtt.
The patient had worsening hypoxia during the case and required non-rebreather and ABG during the case was 7.34/30/71/17.
Denied chest pain or SOB.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of c paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

no wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography in this co-dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel disease.
There was an ostial 60% stenosis immediately before D1, after D1 there was a 70% proximal LAD stenosis.
The mid LAD has difuse 70% stenosis and showed competitive flow.
The D1 had a proximal 70% stenosis before a bifurcation in the vessel and a 40% stenosis in the small branch of vessel immediately after the bifurcation.
The Cx had diffuse disease throughout.
There was 60% stenosis in the proximal LAD prior to the OM1.
There was 50% stenosis between OM1 and OM2 and 60% stenosis between OM2 and OM3.
The distal AV groove Cx supplies a long LPL1 branch and a small LPDA.
The RCA had a proximal 70% stenosis prior to the atrial branch as well as a mid total occlusion after the acute marginal.
The distal RCA and distal acute marginal filled via right to right collaterals.
Arterial conduit angiography revealed the origin of the LIMA to have a 35% stenosis which improved to 20% after intra-atrerial nitroglycerine.
There wasa 75% stenosis in the mid-distal LAD downstream of the LIMA touchdown and diffuse 60% stenosis of the apical LAD.
The left subclavian artery had a proximal 30% stenosis with midl plaquing throughout.
Limited resting hemodynamics revelaed severely elevated left sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 44 mmHg.
There was no transaortic valve gradient on pullback of the catheter from the LV to the aorta.
Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Pt with 75% stenosis to the mid-distal LAD downstream to the LIMA-LAD anastomosis that was not intervened on.
He has had no further chest discomfort.
# PUMP: Pt with elevated end LV pressure (44mmHg) and pulm edema on CXR.
Hypoxia: Pt with hypoxia requiring NRB initially.
Pt no fevers, chills, but with chronic productive cough.
Likely pulm edema from CHF, but started on antibiotics (Vanc/Cefepime for HAP as patient was previously at rehab) overnight given hypoxia.
Leukocytosis: Pt with elevated WBC of 14.1 up to 16.9.
Pt did receive IV solumedrol prior to transfer and likely cause of leukocytosis as well as reactive secondary to NSTEMI.
# Acute on Chonic RF: Pt with Cr of 2.1 on admission, up to 2.3 on discharge with diuresis.
Unclear baseline, but likely secondary to chronic HTN and poor forward flow from ishemia.
Pt also with elevated BP at the OSH.

You need to take plavix, a blood thinner, for at least 1 month and if you suffer no bleeding complications you should ideally continue this medication for one year.
We also started you on treatment for a suspected healthcare- associated pneumonia with the antibiotics, vancomycin and cefepime which were started on [**11-8**], and should be continued for total of 8 day course.
