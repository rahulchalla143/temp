On her Persantine-ETT, she had no symptoms or EKG changes, but imaging revealed a moderate reversible defect in the basilar portion of the inferolateral wall, with an ejection fraction of 54%.
Ultrasound in [**2143-5-12**] showed 60-69% right internal carotid artery stenosis and a normal left, 11) History of ectopic pregnancy, 12) Status post hysterectomy, 13) Status post tonsillectomy, 14) Status post small bowel obstruction with laparotomy and lysis of adhesions, 15) History of melena.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab on [**2143-6-4**] which showed two-vessel coronary artery disease with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, mild pulmonary hypertension.
Heart - S1, S2 with a II/VI systolic murmur at left lower sternal border.
Lungs with inspiratory and expiratory rhonchi bilaterally.
The patient remained intubated overnight due to hypoxia and agitation.
On postoperative day #1, the patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation, and the milrinone was weaned off.
After extubation, the patient had a respiratory acidosis which responded to aggressive chest PT and good pain control.
The patient had difficulty ambulating with physical therapy due to pain and anxiety, requiring stopping multiple times, and ultimately pain medication.
On postoperative day #3, the patient was noted to have crackles bilaterally, as well as significant rhonchi.
The patient was medicated for pain and received albuterol nebulizer treatments by respiratory therapy, and aggressive chest pulmonary toilet during the course of the day on postoperative day #3.
Over the evening on postoperative day #3, the patient was progressively confused, and on the morning of postoperative day #4, the patient was quite hypoxic, and the decision was made to transfer the patient back to the Intensive Care Unit for pulmonary toilet and monitoring of pulmonary status.
Chest x-ray at this time showed CHF, no effusions, and no pneumothorax.
The patient was given more aggressive diuretics, aggressive pulmonary toilet, and pain medication.
During physical therapy, the patient was asymptomatic, not complaining of shortness of breath, or fatigue.
Heart - regular rate and rhythm, no rub, no murmur.
Respiratory - breath sounds were coarse bilaterally with scattered rhonchi bilaterally, no wheezes.
Sternal incision was clean and dry without erythema and no drainage.
The patient had previously had Dermabond applied to the lower portion of her sternum for some drainage and has not had any drainage since.
Right lower extremity vein harvest site was clean and dry.
There was no erythema or drainage.
2) Status post stent to right coronary artery, complicated by dissection requiring emergent coronary artery bypass grafting.
4) Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
8) History of substance abuse.
