Slow R wave progression.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Active bleeding was confirmed angiographically at the hepatic flexure, best accessed through a middle colic branch coming off the proximal superior mesenteric artery.
Successful embolization of the branch of middle colic artery with 6 microcoils at the level of marginal artery with good residual collateral flow at the end of the procedure and cessation of angiographic extravasation.
