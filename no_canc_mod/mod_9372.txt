Recent echocardiogram showed dilated left atrium, severely dilated left ventricle and ejection fraction of 60 percent, 4+ mitral regurgitation, partial mitral leaflet flail.
Preoperative cardiac catheterization showed pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, elevated left filling pressure, ejection fraction 60 percent, no significant coronary artery disease.
Status post hernia repair.
Status post ear surgery.
Status post dental surgery.
The patient was noted to be in sinus rhythm initially postoperatively, however, several hours postoperatively the patient went into a junctional rhythm with a decrease in blood pressure.
The patient was started on dopamine infusion with an increase in heart rate without return of sinus rhythm.
The patient was started on Toradol for pain relief.
The patient's chest tube was removed without incident.
It was felt that this was due to sinus node dysfunction possibly from edema.
Heart regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
There is no erythema or drainage.
Chest x-ray on [**2-7**] showed right lower lobe atelectasis, no pneumothorax and no effusion.
The patient has no peripheral edema.
This was felt to be due to hemoconcentration.
