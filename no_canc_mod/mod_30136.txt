Patient reports that 2 months ago he developed a chest cold with congestion while working as a school crossing guard.
He denied orthopnea and PND but did report gradual development of a right upper quadrant abdominal pain that coincided with his leg swelling.
He was found to have pulmonary edema by CXR with a possible right base consolidation.
A TTE revealed severe biventricular hypokinesis and a small circumferential pericardial effusion.
He states that his abdominal pain has significantly improved.
He also states that his lower extremity edema is improving and that he is able to move his legs better than on admission.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction.
Moderately dilated right ventricle with moderate global systolic dysfunction.
Mild functional mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
CXR ([**2110-6-4**]): Large opacity projecting over the right hemithorax, may represent combination of consolidation, atelectasis, and possible underlying pleural effusion, worrisome for infection, however, underlying malignancy is not excluded, and followup to resolution is recommended.
CXR ([**2110-6-4**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing atelectasis at the left lung base.
The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
The pre-existing extensive opacities at the right lung base, likely to be accompanied by a right pleural effusion, are constant.
[**2110-6-4**]: Probable sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
Left bundle-branch block.
Left atrial enlargement.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2109-4-13**] left bundle-branch block and left atrial enlargement are seen on the current tracing.
[**2110-6-5**]: Sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature beats.
Left bundle-branch block.
Cannot exclude hyperkalemia or myocardial ischemia as the cause.
[**2110-6-11**]: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature depolarizations.

TTE revealed biventricular dilatation and severe hypokinesis with an EF of 15-20%, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate to severe pulmonary artery hypertension and  biatrial dilatation.
Serial EKGs revealed intermitent atrial tachycardia (vs. sinus rhythm with APCs) with an incomplete LBBB.
To investigate the etiology of his CHF, the ICU team checked HIV, which was negative, and iron studies, which were inconsistent with iron overload.
Upon presentation to the cardiology service the patient revealed a history of significant contact with [**Name2 (NI) **] children as he worked as a school crossing guard in the winter months and developed a URI that preceded the onset of his symptoms by several weeks.
His history of long-standing alcohol abuse was concerning for an alcohol-related cardiomyopathy as well.
Patient was then taken for cardiac catheterization which revealed a right dominant system without angiographically apparent disease of the LM, LAD, LCx and RCA.
Early in his course he was also started on Metoprolol (for CHF and an atrial tachycardia), Lisinopril and Spironolactone.
Spironolactone was discontinued prior to discharge as patient was mildly hyperkalemic and there was concern for loss-to-follow-up.
Given his low EF and LBBB, the patient may benefit from CRT but this was not persued during this hospitalization given the acuity of his presentation.
Follow-up of labs for renal function and hyponatremia 4.
Evaluation and consideration of CRT given low EF and LBBB .
Hyponatremia: Patient became hyponatremic following several days of diuresis, which was felt to be due to hypervolemia and not hypovolemia as the patient was not near his supposed dry weight.
Urine lytes were consistent with a prerenal etiology.
Initially attributed to possible pneumonia for which the patient received 5 days of Levofloxacin.
CBCs were consistently in the 12s with a differentials demonstrating a neutrophilic predominance without other concerning features.
He remained afebrile throughout admission.
He had no diarrhea throughout admission.
Metabolic Alkalosis: Patient developed metabolic alkalosis in setting of diuresis.
Hypertension: Patient remained normotensive to slightly hypotensive in the setting of aggressive diuresis.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: New Onset Systolic Heart Failure Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 98732**]: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with swelling in your legs and shortness of breath which is most likely due to heart failure.
A cardiac catheterization was performed and did not reveal any signficant disease in the coronary arteries of your heart.
Your heart failure may have been due to alcohol or a viral infection.
** BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF YOUR ILLNESS AND THE NEW MEDICATIONS THAT YOU WERE STARTED ON, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU FOLLOW-UP VERY CLOSELY WITH YOUR NEW PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR AND CARDIOLOGIST, DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
As above, if you notice increased swelling of your legs or you gain weight (more than 2 lbs), please call your Cardiologist.
