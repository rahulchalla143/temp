No pulmonary embolism.
Mild-to-moderate bibasilar atelectasis.
Tracheomalacia with near complete collapse of the mid trachea during expiration.
[**2170-7-21**]: CXR: In comparison with the study of [**9-18**], there are continued low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and some evidence of vascular congestion.
Opacification at the left base most likely represents atelectasis and there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

Now she is s/p ORIF ([**2170-7-14**]) with hospital course complicated by hypotension, tachycardia and acute hypoxemia.
# Tibula-Fibula Fracture: S/p unwitnessed fall at her nursing home.
She initially presented to ortho clinic where she was found to have a fracture.
Once she was transferred to the medicine floor, she underwent placement of a short leg cast.
Her pain was controlled with tylenol and oxycodone.
Additionally she should continue to take lovenox unil [**6-27**] for DVT prophylaxis.
# Hypoxemia: In the PACU, she was noted to be hypoxic to the 80s and have systolic blood pressures in the 90s.
The etiology of her hypoxia appeared to be multifactorial.
During her ICU stay she was found to be volume overloaded, likely secondary to IVF given during surgery.
She was diuresed with lasix, and her oxygen requirement decreased.
There was no evidence of PE, but she was found to have tracheomalacia of uncertain chronicity.
She was started on broad antibiotic coverage for presumed aspiration PNA and HCAP.
# Encephalopathy (Metabolic): While in the ICU she developed acute agitation and delerium, which was most likely multifactorial, with contributions from underlying dementia, pain, and ICU delerium.
Additonally, she developed hypernatremia while in the ICU, which could have contributed to her confusional state.
She received standing plus PRN haloperidol with good effect, along with acetaminophen and oxycodone for pain control.
Upon transfer to the floor she was noted to have some cogwheeling so her haldol was replaced with seroquel with good effect.
At discharge, patient was confused but calm and redirectable.
# Hypernatremia: In the setting of poor PO intake while in the ICU, she developed hypernatremia.
We treated her hypernatremia with gentle hydration with D5W and encouraging PO intake.
# Hypotension: In the PACU she was noted to have SBP in the 90's.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Tracheomalacia discovered on CTA chest- may need follow-up with pulmonary to determine need for possible stenting - Continued titration of her delirium medications will likely be required - Ortho follow-up next week for cast removal.

Sulfameth/Trimethoprim DS 2 TAB PO BID   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Newbridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **] - [**Location (un) 1411**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary:   Fracture of the tibula/fibula            Hypoxia            Hypernatremia  Secondary: Encephalopathy (acute)            Dementia            COPD   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Following this surgery, you developed some trouble breathing and low blood pressure.
While you were in the ICU, you were found to have some excess fluid in your lungs, which was removed with a medication called lasix.
Your pain was controlled with tylenol and oxycodone, and you were maintained on supplemental oxygen.
While on the floor, it was noticed that you had a finding on your chest x-ray which could be a pneumonia.
Given your increased need for oxygen, you were started on antibiotics for treatment of this possible pneumonia which you will take until [**8-1**].
