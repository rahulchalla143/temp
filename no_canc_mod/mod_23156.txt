Taken by EMS to OSH, where she was neurologically intact but CT scans revealed multiple cervical spine fractures.
L trans foraminal fx at C1, C3, C4, C6, C7, R transverse foraminal fractures at C1, C2,  R vertebral artery dissection on CT and MRI.
Per patient, no neurological defects w\she is able to move all extremities and notes no sensory defects.
Denies history of rectal or UGIB.
Hypertension 2.
Hypothyroidism 5.
HEENT: Pupils:  unable to open eyes due to ecchymosis Neck: [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar in place Lungs: CTA bilaterally.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: B/L scapular fracture (unable to examine) XII: Tongue midline without fasciculations.
Small left-sided pneumothorax located in the lower anterior pleural space.
Multiple rib fractures as detailed above.
Bilateral scapular fractures, right distal clavicle fracture.
Acute fracture involving the T2 vertebra along the anterior aspect of the superior endplate.
No malalignment.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Degloving injury of the left frontoparietal scalp without fracture.
[**2148-12-25**] CT C Spine : There is a linear lucency involving the right lateral mass of C2, best seen on series 4 image 29 likely representing a non-displaced fracture.
At C3 there is a chip fracture involving the left transverse process not extending to the foramen transversarium.
At C4 there is also a chip fracture involving the left transverse process not extending into the transverse foramen.
At C5 and C6 there are fractures of the left transverse process which do extend to the transverse foramen with the fractured lateral fragments slightly laterally and inferior displaced, clearly depicted on the coronal reformations.
There is a fracture involving the C7 right transverse process best seen on series 4 image 73 involving the transverse foramina.
There is also a fracture involving the C1 right transverse process best seen on series 4 image 24 as well as series 9 image 53 which does not clearly extend to the transverse foramina.
Bilateral rib fractures involving the posterior arch of the first ribs is seen.
Small amount of degenerative disease is noted in the mid cervical spine with loss of disc space and small spurring.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
IMPRESSION: Multiple fractures involving the cervical spine as detailed above with involvement of the transverse process and several fractures involving the transverse foramina.
Correlate with CTA to assess for associated vertebral artery injury.
No malalignment or evidence of unstable fracture.
This is likely more due to atherosclerotic disease than trauma/dissection , but further evaluation can be obtained with gadolinium- enhanced MRA and fat- suppressed axial images of the neck if clinically indicated.
Otherwise, no vascular occlusion or stenosis seen in the carotid or vertebral arteries.
Intracranial CTA appears unremarkable except for vascular calcifications.
Large prevertebral hematoma in the cervical region from craniocervical junction to C5 level.
Increased interspinous signal at C5-6 level indicating injury to the interspinous ligament but no evidence of disruption of the anterior, posterior longitudinal ligaments of ligamentum flavum identified.
Moderate spinal stenosis due to degenerative change from C3-4 to C5-6 with extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord.
No evidence of abnormal signal within the spinal cord.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Extremely poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen although the valves are poorly visualized.
Due to multiple injuries including C spine she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Her airway was monitored closely as she had a prevertebral hematoma presumed secondary to her multiple cervical fractures.
There was no evidence of any decreased sensation or paresthesias in her extremities.
Following transfer to the Trauma floor she was evaluated by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy as she was quite limited in her ability to move with her multiple fractures and orthotics.
