Admission Date:  [**2102-4-23**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2046-4-26**]       Sex:  M  Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 55 year old Haitian man with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis diagnosed in [**2090**] on physical examination.
The patient presented in late [**Month (only) 956**] to the Liver Clinic with a worsening shortness of breath, ascites and increased lower extremity edema.
At that time, the patient had a work-up for a liver transplant initiated and in [**2102-3-19**] he was noted to be Child's Class C with a score of 10 and found to have a large mediastinal lymphadenopathy that was concerning for lymphoma.
He was given morphine and Ativan and found to have an elevated white blood cell count with 14% bands.
The patient subsequently developed hypotension with a blood pressure in the 70s over 20, at which time he was started on the sepsis protocol in the Emergency Department.
There was initially concern for infection.
The patient had no ascites, therefore, no SBP and no evidence of pneumonia.
The patient was given antibiotic treatment for a presumed pneumonia that could not be visualized and white blood cell count improved but lower extremity pain persisted.
Hepatitis C cirrhosis diagnosed in [**2090**].
Upper gastrointestinal bleed with Grade 1 varices in [**2101-6-16**].
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission to the Emergency Department, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 98.2 F.; heart rate of 100; blood pressure of 86/78 that decreased to 74/34; respiratory rate of 20 and he was 97% on room air.
He had icteric sclerae.
He had a supple neck with no jugular venous distention.
He had occasional bibasilar rhonchi with good air movement.
His heart had a regular rate with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
His abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, distended, without overt fluid wave present.
There was no shifting dullness and no palpable masses.
Extremities were warm and dry and with three plus pitting edema to the mid tibia bilaterally.
No clubbing or cyanosis and one plus pedal pulses bilaterally.
The patient had no focal deficits.
IMPRESSION:  The impression at admission was for hypotension concerning for sepsis and encephalopathy and possible fentanyl overdose.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and blood pressure stabilized and after ruling out infection, white count normalized with fluids and it was felt that the patient had dehydration encephalopathy and hypotension induced by Fentanyl patch placement.
The patient was stable on transfer to the floor, was monitored carefully and focus became that which was necessary for his lower extremity pain which was quite severe.
The patient did not request this more than two to three times per day for breakthrough pain, but overall the concern was that the patient's pain was described as going throughout his legs, burning in nature in his lower extremities always at a level of six out of ten going up to ten out of ten with shooting burning pain on his lateral thighs bilaterally that occurred with movement.
Subsequent physical examinations revealed a numbness and lack of sensation in the lateral thigh regions of the superficial femoral nerve, in the region of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.
The patient was given gentle diuresis for edema of the ankles, but room air saturations remained normal and the patient had no evidence for ascites.
The patient's creatinine was at 0.8 to 0.9 and increased to 1.9 and the patient was found to be in acute renal failure.
This was presumed to be due to prerenal state given a physical examination consistent with dehydration.
HYPOTENSION ON ADMISSION:  Medication induced was the presumed diagnosis.
The patient had no further hypotensive episodes throughout admission.
LOWER EXTREMITY PAIN:  This seemed to be neuropathic by history and examination with component of meralgia paresthetica from his abdominal distention that was present.
There was no evidence for B12, folate or syphilis as an etiology.
An MRI of the spinal cord weeks prior had revealed no nerve compression or evidence of abscess or meningeal enhancement.
Subsequent MRI of the entire spine revealed no lesions throughout.
The patient's primary care physician was [**Name (NI) 653**] to discuss if the patient ever had a history of this pain in the past.
Per the patient's primary care physician at [**Hospital1 346**], he noted that the patient had pain that was noted to worsen whenever patient had edema.
This frequently occurred in the setting of cryoglobulinemia and vasculitis that was biopsy proven per him.
The patient was noted on past admission to have an elevated ESR greater than 100 and a CRP that was elevated significantly.
There was concern that he was having a current exacerbation of his vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia at this time causing lower extremity pain.
Neurology was consulted and EMG was done and was found to be nonspecific and did not reveal diffuse slowing.
The Neurology consultation felt that the pain was most likely due to meralgia paresthetica and diabetic neuropathy, despite the fact that the patient had a hemoglobin A1C less than six.
There was also concern that it was a perineoplastic syndrome affecting the femoral nerve bilaterally given the patient's history of lung nodules seen on past CT scan.
A repeat CT scan was done and revealed resolution of the right upper lobe lung nodule and stable lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum region.
The pain was managed daily and ambulation was encouraged.
Physical Therapy was given and on subsequent days the patient reported that his pain seemed to be symptomatically better despite decreasing fentanyl patch dosages down to 50 micrograms q. day and decreasing breakthrough pain medications of Oxycodone down to 10 mg up to three doses per day.
Due to the consideration that the pain was due to meralgia paresthetica complicated by diabetic neuropathy complicated by exacerbation of L5-S1 radiculopathy, the patient was instructed to continue Physical Therapy and have home Physical Therapy and continue pain management.
If pain was not noted to improve with Physical Therapy and ambulation, the patient should follow-up to have nerve biopsies to rule out vasculitis or some other nerve pathology.
The patient periodically became encephalopathic and lactulose was increased at these times with the goal of three to five bowel movements per day which resulted in normalization of mental status.
This was monitored carefully and presumed to be due to excessive ADH in the setting of hepatitis C and cirrhosis.
Studies for infection at that time revealed no abnormalities.
The patient was followed clinically and was noted to have no fevers and no evidence for infection.
This was also in the setting of the patient having acute renal failure and a creatinine of 1.9.
There were no focal signs or symptoms to suggest an acute bacterial process.
An abdominal CT failed to demonstrate significant ascites to suggest risk of peritonitis.
This was thought to be due to trauma and Foley.
This was rechecked and there was no evidence for red blood cells or protein which ruled out concern for cryoglobulinemia or vasculitis involving kidneys.
The mediastinal right upper lung mass and lymphadenopathy noted on previous CT scan and the noncontributory FNA that had been done, it was interesting that the right upper lung mass had resolved in three weeks and this decreased the likelihood that it was due to malignancy.
The patient was instructed to have CT scans followed and to have additional biopsies as an outpatient to be arranged by [**Hospital6 14430**].
The patient was also noted to have an elevated TSH during admission as well as postural tremor of low amplitude in his right hand.
At the time, it was felt that this should be followed and rechecked as an outpatient and that there was no clear benefit of working up hypothyroidism in the setting of hospitalization and concurrent illnesses that could possibly elevate hormone levels.
Thrombocytopenia was presumed secondary to liver disease.
DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2:  For diabetes mellitus type 2, the patient was maintained on glyburide 2.5 mg q. day.
This is decreased from his home dose due to hypoglycemic episodes occurring in patient.
