Resection of left atrial appendage.
Coronary bypass grafting x3 of the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and the first diagonal artery.
History of Present Illness: 71M with h/o hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
He has had 2 episodes of chest pain and SOB in the preceeding 2 weeks.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
+BS EXTREMITIES: No c/c, 1+ pitting edema b/l LE, +varicosities b/l.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is no evidence for pulmonary embolism.
There are enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, with right paratracheal lymph nodes measuring up to 17 mm in short axis.
Aortopulmonary window lymph nodes measure up to 10 mm in short axis.
There is a small right pleural effusion associated with bibasilar atelectasis.
There are scattered bilateral pulmonary nodules.
There is diffuse interlobular septal thickening, suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
Perihilar ground-glass opacities also likely reflect volume overload.
Limited views of the upper abdomen reveal bilateral renal cysts, with a right renal cyst measuring up to 2.8 cm and a left renal cyst measuring up to 2.5 cm.
Colonic diverticulosis is partially imaged.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Multilevel degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine with large anterior osteophytes.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Diffuse interlobular septal thickening with perihilar ground-glass opacities, likely reflective of volume overload.
Associated tiny right pleural effusion.
Numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules.
A close interval follow-up Chest CT in 3 months is recommended given a history of prostate cancer, as these nodules may reflect metastases.
TEE [**10-23**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is moderately depressed left ventricular function (LVEF = 30-35 %).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Depressed left ventricular systolic function.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed three vessel disease.
The LMCA had a 20% distal lesion.
The LAD had an ostial 50% stenosis followed by a hazy 90% stenosis involving the D1 which has a hazy 50% lesion.
The LCx has a proximal 40% lesion at the the origin of the LMCA.
The RCA has a distal 60% stenosis at the PDA/PL bifurcation.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated central aortic pressures 141/83 with a mean of 100 mmHg.
Mild systemic hypertension .
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
Extensive spondylophytes, no larger pleural effusions.
No lung nodules or masses.
On the right there is mild heterogeneous plaque in the ICA.
On the left there is mild heterogeneous plaque in the ICA.
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
Cardiac MRI [**10-26**] CMR demonstrated 20% likelihood of recovery of function of anterolateral wall and 60% likelihood of recovery of anterior wall.
Interseptal akinesis and distal scar  .
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 65576**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2117-10-22**] for further management of his myocardila infarction.
A CTA upon admission was negative for a pulmonary embolism however numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules were discovered.
A cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
A viability study demonstrated 20% likelihood of recovery of function of anterolateral wall and 60% likelihood of recovery of anterior wall.
He was worked-up by the ccradiac surgical service in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid ultrasound which showed less then 40% stenosis bilaterally.
Lasix intravenously was continued for mild heart failure symptoms.
Over the next several hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without difficulty.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.POD#2 his rhythm went into atrial fibrillation and he was treated medically with Amiodarone and increased Beta-blocker.
