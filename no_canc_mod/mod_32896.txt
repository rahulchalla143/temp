She was given steroids for treatment of the ?
Dynamic CT concerning for tracheomalacia.
Became hypotensive to 80's with intubation but improved with ivf (1L->102 SBP) thought secondary to propofol.
Of note, she had sinus tach at [**Hospital3 **] early in her hospital course, ruled out for MI, TTE [**2-28**] EF 60%, no valvular [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] started on metoprolol.
She was treated with BiPAP intermittently, with elevated PCO2: 50-70, which was new.
Brain MRI reportedly negative, cervical spine MRI with multi-level spinal stenosis.
Past Medical History: asthma bronchitis GERD obesity panic d/o anxiety s/p ccy kidney stones recent PNA with possible ards that improved on steroids DMII, diet controlled  Social History: No smoking, etoh, illicit drug use.

PSYCH: drowsy but arouses and responds to questions, able to follow commands   Pertinent Results: ECG [**2139-4-27**]: NSR (67), nl axis, intervals, TW flattening in III.
TTE [**2139-2-27**]: LVEF 60%, no valvular dysfunction, no effusion, no shunt.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 54 yo woman with asthma, recent pna, GERD, anxiety, and respiratory failure with neruomuscular weakness with respiratory failure and apparent tracheomalacia on dynamic CT.  1)Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient transferred from OSH with low VC suggestive of NM weakness, AChR-Ab - but + MuSK and recent history of difficulty holding up head, keeping eyes open.
Treated there with ivig, solumedrol, mestinon with no improvement.
She had been intubated at the OSH for respiratory failure.
Plasmapheresis was started without complication.
She initially did well but refused BiPAP because of severe anxiety and claustrophobia.
She was unable to tolerate BiPAP despite significant doses of valium and she became increasingly fatigued until she was using her accessory muscles of respiration and retaining CO2 on her ABG.
There was evidence of TBM as elucidated below.
She was comfortable on the vent, alert and interactive although she remained quite anxious and was put onto a fentanyl and versed gtt.
She was extubated on [**5-8**] to supplemental oxygen by face mask went out briefly to the neuro stepdown unit, but returned after 24 hours for tachypnea.
She did very well after this intubation, attributed to myasthenic crisis once again, but the decision was made, given the prolonged course of this episode, to undergo trach/peg, which occurred on [**5-22**] without complication.
2)Asthma: There was some concern that this might have been a misdiagnosis in the setting of undiagnosed TBM and Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **].
Patient's PFT's are unknown, but she did have evidence of bronchospasm during her fiberoptic intubation.
3)Tracheomalacia: Patient had evidence of TBM on her chest VT performed at the OSH.
A repeat chest CT was performed which showed only moderate TBM so the patient had another fiberoptic bronchoscopy on [**5-7**] which showed moderate to severe TBM.
5)Sinus tachycardia: During this admission patient has been in and out of sinus tachycardia with elevations to 160.
Likely autonomic instability secondary to Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **].
No beta blockade given MG.  6)Anxiety/panic d/o: patient is very anxious quite frequently and gets tachycardic in response with worsened respiratory status.
Psychiatry was consulted and per their recommendations patient's prozac was increased to 40 mg daily and valium PRN was used to control her acute anxiety.
Acute Respiratory Failure  Secondary Diagnosis: 1.
Asthma 2.
DM, diet controlled   Discharge Condition: Fair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for acute respiratory distress due to newly diagnosed myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].
