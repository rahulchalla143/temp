During that admission, he briefly stayed in the ICU overnight for concern of pneumonia, which resolved quickly and was therefore felt to represent aspiration pneumonitis.
A Chest CT done immediately after his ICU stay documented resolution of his left lower lobe consolidation but persistent atelectasis and bronchiectasis consistent with recurrent aspiration.
He reports having a poor appetite but eating yoghurt and taking in fluids nonetheless.
He states that as part of his intake at [**Hospital1 **], his blood pressure was checked and was found to be "very low."
He was alert and oriented and reported chest pain to some but not all of his examiners.
A FAST ultrasound was negative for bleed and CXR did not show infiltrate.
He was given 10mg of IV decadron for concern of adrenal insufficiency.
While he was in the ED, he denied suicidality or ingestion of pills, even after he was seen in his room with an open bottle of colace spilled in front of him.
He stated he had had an episode of non-bloody emesis en route to the ICU, although this was not reported by the staff who transferred him.
He also denied suicidality or medication overdose.

No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
[**2132-12-15**] CXR: Persistent vague opacity in the left lower lung likely represents atelectasis or pneumonia.
Left subclavian catheter terminates at upper SVC without pneumothorax.
Vague increase in left lung base opacity may represent atelectasis vs pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old gentleman with recurrent admissions for hypotension +/- renal failure and aspiration presented with hypotension, bradycardia and acute renal failure, which is thought to be due to beta blocker and ACE inhibitor over dose.
Hypotension: He presented with hypotension felt to be related drug overdose.
Per review of his records, he has a history of episodes of severe hypotension with systolic pressures in the 50s and 60s that prompt intubation, sepsis treatment, and ICU admission with extremely rapid clinical improvement.
In addition, he was noted to hoard medications and take many pills at once during his last admission and there was an episode in the ED in which the team was concerned he was trying to take in an entire bottle of colace.
Multi-drug overdose seemed most consistent, especially as he was both hypotensive and bradycardic.
He was evaluated by psychiatry who determined that this was not a suicide attempt, however was likely poor medical management.
He was briefly on antibiotics for possible sepsis but these were stopped the morning after admission due to low clinical suspicion for infection.
Given that the very likely reason for his multiple admissions with hypotension and bradycardia are due to overdose/inappropriate self administration of his antihypertensives, these have been disconintued altogether.
# Acute renal failure: His creatinine increased from 1.1 on his recent discharge to 4.0 on admission.
His renal function recovered fully within few days and the acute failure is thought to be due to Lisinopril overdose.
# Type 2 DM and peripheral neuropathy: He was continued on insulin, ASA, and gabapentin.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Continued statin  # H/o Depression:  Continued cymbalta.
# Chronic pain and spinal stenosis:  Continued oxycodone  # Neurogenic bladder:  Continued ditropan  # Access: He had a left subclavian CVL placed in the ED.
