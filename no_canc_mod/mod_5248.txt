Admission Date:  [**2151-10-21**]     Discharge Date:  [**2151-10-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2130-8-2**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 332**])  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 21-year-old gentleman with a history of cystinuria complicated by recurrent nephrolithiasis, status post multiple ureteroscopies, who presented to the Emergency Department today with complaints of left flank pain; again began to feel like past episodes of nephrolithiasis.
The procedure was without complications.
The patient was extubated without difficulty.
No laryngeal spasm was noted.
One and a half hours later, the patient got up to use the bathroom and complained increased shortness of breath.
The patient had bilateral wheezes but was in no respiratory distress.
A chest x-ray was obtained, and the Intensive Care Unit team was called.
The patient reports no history of asthma, tobacco use, pneumonia, or pulmonary disease.
He denies any history of coronary artery disease, or shortness of breath at baseline, a family history of early of early cardiac or pulmonary disease.
Cystinuria diagnosed at the age of 13 (complicated by recurrent nephrolithiasis).
(b)  The patient has a history of multiple lithotripsy and cystoscopy procedures with extractions and stent placements.
SEASONAL ALLERGIES.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Paternal grandmother with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Maternal grandfather had a cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, and lymphoma.
Maternal grandmother had lymphoma and hypertension.
He has scattered aunts and uncles with coronary artery disease.
He was tachycardic and without murmurs.
His lungs had crackles at the left base with good air movement throughout the lungs.
There were coarse breath sounds.
No paradoxical breathing.
He had no edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   His chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.
ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 21-year-old gentleman with a history of cystinuria complicated by kidney stones, status post lithotripsy with general anesthesia.
The post procedure period was complicated by hypoxia and respiratory distress.
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS ISSUES:  The etiology of the patient's symptoms was not entirely clear.
At first, negative pressure pulmonary edema was considered; although, the time course was atypical as it occurred one and a half hours after he was extubated.
The patient also with evidence of an infiltrate in his right lower lobe suggesting possible aspiration with pneumonitis.
It was also possible, given the patient's multiple allergies, that he had developed an allergic response to a number of the medications he had received intraoperatively which caused him to have some bronchospasm.
Of note, the patient received Decadron 8 mg in the operating room for unclear reasons which may have blunted any reaction he had, as with our examination he had no evidence of respiratory distress; although, he did have evidence of hypoxia by his oxygen saturations.
The patient was treated with albuterol nebulizers which were changed to ipratropium given increased tachycardia with the albuterol.
Once the patient reached the Intensive Care Unit, he was able to maintain his oxygen saturations above 95% without supplemental oxygen support.
He was continued on a steroid inhaler and cromolyn inhaler as needed for shortness of breath.
He had a slight elevation in his white blood cell count but was not treated for any aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was instructed to seek medical attention if he were to develop shortness of breath or wheezing not relieved with the inhalers or any other symptoms of concern.
as needed (for shortness of breath or wheezing).
