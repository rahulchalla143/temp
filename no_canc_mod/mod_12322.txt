He was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 39783**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for shortness of breath and found to have a new cardiomyopathy with EF 30% and global hypokinesis with some akinesis of the inferior wall.
He was seen by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on [**2165-3-1**] where he reported worsening shortness of breath and symptoms of advanced heart failure.
Stress testing with additional vascular imaging was planned.
The patient underwent pharmacologic stress testing this morning with development of ischemic ECG changes (worsening global ST depression) along with hypotension.
He has noted increasing swelling in both legs since discharge and a slight worsening in the wound on the back of his left lower leg.
He denies any pain or cramping in his legs with ambulation; it is mainly his shortness of breath that limits his activities.

Intravenous administration of echo contrast was used due to poor native endocardial border definition.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
No LV mass/thrombus.
Severely depressed LVEF.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal with moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF= 25-30 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a small, circumferential, echo dense pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Small echo-dense pericardial effusion with no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Significant pulmonary regurgitation.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions, more marked on the right.
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1569**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11006**] Approved: FRI [**2165-4-12**] 12:20 PM    Imaging Lab    Brief Hospital Course: This patient is a 69 year old white male with multiple risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiomyopathy who was admitted for a positive stress test.
Nuclear imaging showed areas of reversibility concerning for Left main disease.
He also was in new atrial fibrillation.
His medical regimen was adjusted after admission and he remained pain free.
He remained in atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
He underwent catheterization which revealed triple vessel disease, severe aortic stenosis and both systolic and diastolic dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30-35%.
A urinary infection delayed surgery and was treated with a course of antibiotics.
On [**3-26**] he underwent cardiac surgery  with an Aortic valve replacement (#25mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical)/coronary artyery bypass grafting (left internal mammary artery grafted to left anterior descending artery/saphenous vein grafted to Diagnal/obtuse marginal/AM, Aortic root enlargement with pericardial patch).
On [**3-29**] he developed acute hypotension.
A surface echo was negative preliminarily, however, a TEE demonstrated a significant pericardial effusion with tamponade.
There was a bleeding source from a vein graft found as the source for the effusion.
He remained in atrial fibrillation postop and Amiodarone was continued for rate control.
He was very difficult to induce a diuresis and required resumption of phenylephrine until [**4-4**] when he became hypercarbic to 60 and acidotic.
He became nonoliguric and a Lasix infusion was continued.
His metabolic alkalosis was treated with hydrochloric acid replacement and Diamox.
He remained stable with an effective cough and arrangements were made for a rehabilitation facility.
