Hct was 25.6 at rehab on [**7-27**] and stable on admission and throughout hospital course, so a large GI bleed was felt to be unlikely.
The situation was felt to be consistent with a trach site bleed with aspiration.
His tube feeds were restarted when we felt that the bleed was more from the trach site (which is now resolved).
# Respiratory failure: chronically trached.
# UTI: We held off on treating the patient for his positive UA as he is likely chronically colonized and was afebrile throughout.
A foley was inserted for high volume on a bladder scan.
# Parkinson's disease: Pt with severe dysphagia, and tracheostomy.
On admission, patient was slightly more rigid than normal, which was attributed to missing a dose of medications.
