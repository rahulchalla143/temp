No pneumothorax is seen.
Small amount of pleural effusion is noted most likely on the right.
ECG [**8-11**]: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Left bundle-branch block with a single narrowly conducted QRS complex.
The mediastinal contours again demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob.
Additionally, subtle blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles persist, compatible with small pleural effusions.
Thereis no pneumothorax.
