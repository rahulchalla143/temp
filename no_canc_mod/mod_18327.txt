HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88 year old Armenian speaking gentleman transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] from [**Hospital6 54196**] status post acute anterolateral ST elevation MI.
The patient's ST elevation MI was complicated by ventricular fibrillation  and ventricular tachycardia arrest two to three times in the field.
The cardiac catheterization on [**2198-3-26**], showed one vessel disease and the patient underwent successful stenting of his left anterior descending coronary artery/diagonal two bifurcation using the crush technique.
The patient does have a history of lower gastrointestinal bleed felt secondary to hemorrhoids based on past colonoscopy and subsequently developed a hematocrit drop, reportedly from 34.0 to 26.0 while on Aspirin and Plavix.
His primary care physician discontinued his Aspirin and Plavix given the concern for the lower gastrointestinal bleeding on [**2198-4-11**].
EMS was called and the patient was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction.
The patient had several ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia arrests in the field and, at the outside hospital, each time he responded to 200 joule shocks.
Cardiac catheterization on arrival to [**Hospital1 190**] showed a thrombosis of the previously placed left anterior descending coronary artery stent.
The patient does not have a history of diabetes mellitus or high cholesterol.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies according to his children.
He had no audible bruits.
He had normal S1 to S2 without audible murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable hepatosplenomegaly or pulsatile masses.
Extremities were warm and dry with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, one plus pedal pulses bilaterally.
Right groin catheter and sheath site were clean, dry and intact with minimal oozing and no palpable hematoma.
He had no obvious focal neurological deficits.
Admission electrocardiogram was notable for a junctional tachycardia at 105 beats per minute, left axis deviation, ST elevations which were 3.0 millimeters V2 through V6, new compared to previous electrocardiogram [**2198-3-27**].
He had no known previous echocardiogram.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2198-4-16**], showed thrombotic occlusion at the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stent, treated with Rheolytic treatment, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with 20 percent residual disease at the left anterior descending coronary artery stent, 40 percent at the diagonal origin.
There is no evidence of dissection.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 88 year old gentleman was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from outside hospital status post acute anterolateral ST elevation myocardial infarction complicated by several episodes of ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia arrest and was found on emergent cardiac catheterization here to have restenosis of his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stent which was successfully opened with Rheolytic and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty therapy requiring intraaortic balloon pump postprocedure.
ST elevation myocardial infarction - Based on his electrocardiogram, the patient had a large ST elevation myocardial infarction.
The patient had an echocardiogram to evaluate his myocardial function post ST elevation myocardial infarction.
The patient's echocardiogram documented his left atrium was mildly dilated.
He had mild left ventricular hypertrophy, severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior wall, apex, distal and inferior wall hypokinesis as well.
No left ventricular aneurysm was noted and no masses or thrombi were noted in the left ventricle.
Based on the significant akinesis, it was felt the patient would likely benefit from long term anticoagulation to prevent the risk of thrombotic embolic stroke.
The team discussed with the patient's family the risks and benefits of anticoagulation given his history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
The patient was noted to have guaiac positive stool after initiating Coumadin and gastroenterology was consulted for further workup.
In addition in the setting of recent myocardial infarction, the patient was initiated on higher dose of Lipitor 80 mg p.o.
Atrial fibrillation - After discontinuing the intraaortic balloon pump, the patient was noted to be in supraventricular tachycardia.
Electrocardiogram of this rhythm noted it to be most consistent with atrial fibrillation.
The patient continued to have bursts of atrial fibrillation throughout his hospital stay which seemed to be best controlled with intravenous Amiodarone.
Amiodarone,  however, the patient continued to have bursts of atrial fibrillation on the p.o.
This did seem to help break the patient out of his atrial fibrillation rhythm by virtue of the slower rapid ventricular response, however, the patient was noted to have significant sinus pauses with the use of Metoprolol.
His atrial fibrillation was complicated by the fact that the patient developed flash pulmonary edema with these episodes of atrial fibrillation.
The team felt that possibly his significant volume overload status was due to inability to absorb p.o.
Congestive heart failure - The patient was noted to have evidence of increased pulmonary vascular markings and peripheral edema consistent with congestive heart failure after multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation.
In addition, the patient had received significant volume resuscitation with his hypotension post cardiac catheterization and intraaortic balloon pump placement.
It was felt that the volume resuscitation for his hypotension as well as rapid atrial fibrillation contributed to development of congestive heart failure.
The Nesiritide was continued from [**2198-4-20**], to [**2198-4-23**], when the Nesiritide was discontinued secondary to hypotension.
At this point, the patient's hypotension became a limiting factor in terms of further diuresis.
The patient was noted to have significant bilateral pleural effusions.
These were tapped by interventional pulmonary service for diagnostic purposes.
There were no organisms and no polymorphonuclear cells on gram stain.
This was felt to be likely just a result of his congestive heart failure.
Gastrointestinal bleed - The patient has a history of lower gastrointestinal bleed felt secondary to hemorrhoids based on past colonoscopy.
On admission to Coronary Care Unit, he did have a nasogastric tube and was noted to have gastric occult positive nasogastric output.
After several days of Coumadin, the patient was noted to have heme positive stool.
The gastroenterology team felt that given his recent ST elevation myocardial infarction, he was too high risk to perform lower intestinal evaluation with colonoscopy.
In addition, he was tested for H. pylori antigen and his H. pylori antibody was positive suggestive of active or past infection.
A decision was made to hold on treating his H. pylori immediately given his multiple medical problems and concern that the patient may be at risk for aspiration with multiple p.o.
E. coli bacteremia - On [**2198-4-23**], the patient had blood cultures drawn.
Three out of four bottles came back positive for E. coli which was resistant only to Ampicillin and Ampicillin/Sulbactam.
In addition, one out of four bottles grew out coagulase negative Staphylococcus which was felt to be a contaminant.
The source of infection was possibly secondary to bacterial translocation across the bowel wall in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially given multiple negative urine cultures.
Arrhythmia, sinus pause - The patient was noted to have significant sinus pause with beta blocker treatment of rapid atrial fibrillation.
The patient was noted to have junctional rhythm in the 30s after 2.5 of intravenous Metoprolol as well as five second pause.
He should have a pacemaker placed prior to discharge home, however, this will not be done until the patient has been adequately treated with intravenous antibiotics for his E. coli bacteremia.
The swallowing assessment noted that the patient cleared his throat on several occasions after coughing following sips of thin liquids from the cup as well as through the straw.
He was noticed to have a pill get stuck in his throat which cleared after a sip of water.
Bedside swallow evaluation recommended that the patient have a video swallow to definitively rule out aspiration and make safe diet recommendations.
