Admission Date:  [**2123-2-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-2-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-5-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Vicodin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6346**] Chief Complaint: Rectosigmoid colonic stricture, chronic partial large bowel obstruction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, splenic flexure takedown, left colectomy, colonic lavage, low anterior resection, re-resection of anastomosis, rigid sigmoidoscopy, [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain placement, nasogastric tube; central venous access; transesophageal echocardiogram  History of Present Illness: 67 year old female with spina bifida and spine scoliosis presented to the outpatient clinic where on workup she was found to have colonic stricture.
She had an open cholecystectomy 3 years prior for complications of gallstones.
Family History: Father deceased - MI at age 75, sister deceased [**3-2**] CAD at age 78  Physical Exam: Morning Rounds [**2123-2-17**]  Tm: 99.2 Tc: 97.5 HR: 106 BP: 124/62 RR: 20 93% 2L Gen: Patient lying in bed in  non-acute disteress, dysmorphic positioning secondary to spina bifida noted.
Res: No respiratory distress Abd: moderatly protruberant within limits for patient, soft, appropriately tender to palpation, no guarding, no masses.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Nasogastric feeding tube passes into a distended stomach and out of view.
Large area of new right perihilar consolidation could be pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage but in the presence of a mild degree of left perihilar opacification could be a markedly asymmetric pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-12-23**], the severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are higher.
The right ventricular cavity is now dilated with mild free wall hypokinesis.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2123-2-19**] there is no diagnostic interim change.
While in the PACU she required pressors post-operatively and was sent to the surgical intensive care unit for recovery for acute respiratory faluire and hypotension.
Her hospital course in the SICU on day of transfer to the floor can be summarized by the following review of systems:  Neurologic: Dilantin 100q8 for seixure prophylaxis, Morphine for pain on day of transfer to the floor [**2123-2-25**] she was following commands with intermittent confusion/delenrium.
She appropriately recieved epinephrine, atropine, several liters of fluid for low BP and 2 unites of PRBCs.
The patient remained unresponsive and CPR was stopped ending the code per the SICU Attending who pronounced the patient as deceased.
