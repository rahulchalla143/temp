There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (slightly preserved thickening at the base and infero-lateral walls).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen (due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be underestimated).
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No significant aortic or mitral regurgitation seen.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
It was felt that she developed conduction system disease in the setting of ischemia although other etiology were ruled out, including thyroid disease (mildly elevated TSH likely [**1-10**] sick euthyroid), myeloma.
CHF:  The etiology of this was felt to be ischemic given the WMA on echo (anteroseptal HK).
She could be a candidate for coumadin given her low EF and WMA, but given her guaiac pos stool and hx of falls, it was felt to be too risky.
SOB:  Felt to be due to CHF.
The levaquin and flagyl were discontinued as she did not develop an infiltrate on CXR, remained afebrile, and her leucocytosis resolved.
