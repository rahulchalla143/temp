FINDINGS: Mildly enlarged heart is stable.
There is a small stable left pleural effusion.
Shortness of breath.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Moderate symmetric LVH.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
Conclusions: PRE-BYPASS:  1.The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
A bioprosthetic valve is seen in the Aortic position.
Peak velocity across the aortic valve is 1.7 m/s, with a mean gradient of 10 mm of Hg.
4.Trace mitral regurgitation is present.
