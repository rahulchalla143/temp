No definite underlying mass is seen.
There is no definite underlying aneurysm on this non-contrast study.
The septum pellucidum appears to be shifted approximately 2 mm to the right which may be positional or possibly due to slight mass effect.
IMPRESSION: Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the left temporal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema.
Septum pellucidum shifted approximately 2 mm to the right may be positional or indicate slight mass effect.
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2106-2-5**] 2:15 AM  As seen on CT, there is a large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left temple lobe with a fluid-fluid hematocrit level seen within it.
FLAIR images demonstrate surrounding edema without shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
There is central high signal on DWI and low signal on ADC consistent with acute hemorrhage.
The intracranial flow voids are preserved without any evidence of high-flow arteriovenous malformation.
There is no abnormal contrast enhancement or mass.
Minimal ethmoid air cell mucosal thickening versus fluid is noted anteriorly.
MRA OF THE BRAIN: The distal internal carotid and vertebral arteries are normal in caliber, as are their intracranial branches.
There is no evidence of occlusion, flow limiting stenosis, or aneurysm.
Note is made of an infundibulum at the takeoff of the right MCA inferior temporal branch.
There is no evidence on this MRA study of arteriovenous malformation, or other vascular abnormality.
Large left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
In the absence of other explanation, a catheter angiogram may be of value to exclude abnormalities such as small arteriovenous malformations, which are below the resolution of MRA.
EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and sleeping states due to persistent mixed theta and delta frequency slowing, moderate in amplitude, noted in the left fronto-temporal region, at times with periodic admixed slow blunted sharp waves with phase reversal at T3.
The findings are consistent with an underlying area of cortical and subcortical dysfunction with the periodic blunted slow sharp waves raising concern for a potential focus of epileptogenesis.
However, no runs of more frequent or sustained discharges were noted.
No electrographic seizures were noted.
Conventional Cerebral Angiogram: Notable for left temporal lobe arteriovenous malformation.
She had an MRI/MRA which did not show an underlying mass or AVM.
She was therefore taken to the angio suite and found to have a left temporal lobe AVM.
She continued to have a fluent aphasia, with impaired comprehension for commands but some intact repetition for single words and recognition of phrases (and appropriate answers) for questions regarding headache.
She was discharged on Keppra given left temporal sharp waves.
Disp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*1*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Intracerebral hemorrhage Arteriovenous malformation of the left temporal lobe  Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for sudden difficulty speaking (fluent aphasia) that was related to a left temporal lobe hemorrhage.
You are being treated for a urinary tract infection (two days remaining).
Call your doctor or 911 immediately if you experience worsening headache, worsening difficulty speaking or comprehending speech, weakness, numbness, tingling, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms.
