Admission Date:  [**2161-9-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-9-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-9-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5084**] Chief Complaint: nausea and emesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2161-9-16**]: suboccipital decompressive craniectomy and evacuation of hematoma [**2161-9-16**]: Right frontal EVD placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 51 year old man with recent MI on Coumadin, ASA, Plavix with 2-3 hours n/emesis, headache.
CT head showed a large cerebellar hemorrhage with developing hydrocephalus.
Family History: Positive family history of coronary artery disease.
Pertinent Results: [**2161-9-15**] STRESS Test- IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
No ischemic ECG changes with 2D echocardiographic evidence of prior myocardial infarction without inducible ischemia to achieved workload.
Abnormal hemodynamic response to physiologic stress.
[**2161-9-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.
Large mixed attenuation acute hematomas in the cerebellar hemispheres, obliterating the fourth ventricle, causing upstream supratentorial hydrocephalus, upward transtentorial herniation, as well as tonsillar herniation.
Small rounded hyperdensity in the right parietal lobe with a peripheral rim of edema and associated subarachnoid hemorrhage could represent a small hematoma, raising concern also for a potential underlying mass lesion as an important differential consideration; this possibility should also be considered regarding extensive bilateral cerebellar hemorrhage.
[**2161-9-17**] NCHCT:  Interval occipital decompressive craniectomy with persistent cerebellar hemorrhage and edema.
There is progressive obstructive hydrocephalus with hemorrhage now in the third and lateral ventricles.
Again, the appearance is concerning for underlying mass lesion.
The course of the line is unremarkable, there is no pneumothorax.
Surgery was without complication.
Post operative CT revealed significant hemorrhage in the posterior fossa, as well as intraventricular hemorrhage.
In the afternoon of [**9-17**] the patient's pupils became fixed and dilated and was no longer breathing over the ventilator.
