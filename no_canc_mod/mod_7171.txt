therapy for a midline abdominal wound from her verntral hernia repair with mesh.
She noted the rather abrupt onset of progressively worsening RUQ pain with radiation over the subcostal margin into the left upper quadrant.
The pain was previously [**10-2**] before getting dilaudid but has currently mostly subsided.
SHe continues to have ostomy output and there is air in the bag with some brown/green liquid stool.
She cannot relate whether the output has increased or decreased.
She called the transplant coordinators and related chest pain, but this is not present currently and she denies chest pain or shortness of breath earlier in the day.

An abdominal/pelvis CT demonstrated decreased ascites and patent venous system, partially distended gallbladder, without wall edema.
(No findings specific for acute cholecystitis) and intact ileostomy, without evidence of bowel obstruction.
KUB showed diffusely distended loops of small bowel suggestive of ileus, without evidence of high grade obstruction.
Early obstruction was not excluded and there was no free intraperitoneal air.
Over the next 24 hours, there was no ostomy output with worsening abdominal pain.
An NG tube was placed, but did not drain any gastric contents.
Repeat KUB was showed increased dilatation of the small bowel.
Based on these findings, she was taken to the OR and underwent exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions for a small bowel obstruction.
Operative findings noted the transverse colon and omentum were stuck to the previously placed mesh with very vascularized adhesions.
Running of the small bowel demonstrated a tight adhesion causing kinking of the bowel with distal decompressed bowel and proximal dilated bowel.
This was thought to the source of obstruction and was lysed.
After extubation,  she was very agitated and received ativan and haldol prn.
She was tachycardic but never febrile.
Diet was advanced and tolerated, but kcals were insufficient therefore, an EGD was performed without sedation on [**9-18**] with placement of a bridled postpyloric feeding tube.
Later that day, she experienced visual hallucinations (seeing bugs everywhere) and attempted to get out of bed independently, but fell to floor onto left side experiencing incision bleeding/hematoma, traumatic foley removal, bleeding from stoma and complaints of left shoulder/hip discomfort.
Stomal bleeding stopped with change of pouch.
These were negative for fracture.
Shoulder Xray reveaved an unusual appearance to the humeral head and neck, raising the possibility of a prior fracture involving the greater tuberosity of the humerus.
Hip and shoulder pain resolved.
Of note, she did experience stomal bleeding (at 11 o'clock)on the day of discharge.
She is known to have peristomal varices.
She also developed a red, slightly raised rash on upper/inner thighs and right antecubital area as well as crease of right eye from unclear etiology.
