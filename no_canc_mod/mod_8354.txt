There is blunting of both costophrenic angles, right greater than left, consistent with pleural effusions.
There is no evidence for overt pulmonary edema or focal consolidation.
These issues resolved w/ decreased pain meds and fluid resuscitation.
#) UTI: Has history of recurrent UTIs, resistant to multiple antibiotics.
UA collected on [**1-3**] grew mixed flora - likely fecal contaminants.
Repeat U/A after changing foley showed proteus miribilis.
Started abx to treat given hx multiple UTIs in this pt w/ diabetes and indwelling catheter.
Risk of recurrent infection was explained but pt wants to keep foley.
Condom cath not possible due to retracted penis.
Ophtho consult to eval for chorioretinitis - no evidence of fungemia.
#) pain control:  pt was taking MS contin 100mg tid at home, but unclear why he has been taking this - possibly for multiple chronic joint pain.
He exhibited no signs of withdrawal during this admission.
He gave permission to contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24792**] who prescribes his pain meds.
Titrated up to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] for persistently elevated BP but dose limited by HR in 30s to 50s.
Considered MRA of renal arteries given resistance to multiple hypertensive regimen, but unable to perform this study due to pt's habitus.
