This narrowing is  circumferential without evidence of a distinct dominant mass on the anterior  or the posterior aspect of the trachea.
The thyroid gland is small but  demonstrates no evidence of a definite mass.
No definite lymphadenopathy is  seen in the neck.
Degenerative changes are seen in the cervical spine.
In the visualized thorax a right pleural effusion is identified with small  lymph nodes in the prevascular space and in the pretracheal space.
Correlation  with chest films and CT is recommended.
IMPRESSION: Circumferential tracheal stenosis approximately 1.5 cm below the  vocal cords.
No dominant mass is visualized or evidence of lymphadenopathy  seen in the neck.
LENIs [**6-27**] negative  [**6-30**]: A.  Thyroid isthmus, biopsy, (A): Thyroid tissue, no evidence of malignancy.
B.  Trachea, secretions, (B): Mucus, inflammatory cells and bacterial organisms.
C.  Trachea, stenosis, biopsy (C):Squamous metaplasia, scarring, acute and chronic inflammation, no tumor seen.
There is no evidence for masses, stones, hydronephrosis, or perirenal fluid collections.
1) SOB - On the morning following admission, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 50389**] was seen by ENT to evaluate for upper airway obstruction, due to stridor on physical exam.
Laryngoscopy was concerning for a subglottic mass and a CT scan revealed: circumferential tracheal stenosis about 1.5 cm below vocal cords (measures 7 mm c/t 20 mm at level of thoracic outlet).
No dominant mass or LAD in neck noted.
In the morning of [**6-29**], the patient had an episode of worsening stridor/SOB while eatting breakfast.
Biopsies were taken are revealed only fibrous tissue.
Later that afternoon, at around 4:30 p.m., a pulmonary fellow entered the room to evaluate the patient for his subglottic stenosis and found the patient cyanotic without breath sounds.
Otherwise he had been without complaint.
2) CAD- Troponins are chronically elevated in this patient, at 0.16 on admit.
He did not have any ekg changes or CP, and there was no clinical suspicion for MI.
4) AFIB- Coumadin was stopped on [**6-28**] for his procedure.
5) Acute renal failure - Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 50389**] had a baseline creatinine of 1.8, and went into acute renal failure shortly after administration of IV contrast for his CT scan.
