There is associated mass effect with shift of a variant cavum vergae.
There is also intraventricular hemorrhage layering in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], likely due to extension of the left thalamic hemorrhage.
There is no associated obstructive hydrocephalus.
No other foci of hemorrhage is appreciated.
There is prominence of the basilar artery and aneurysm cannot be excluded.
There is periventricular hypodensity compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
There is no evidence of transtentorial or uncal herniation.
No acute fractures identified.
Right thalamic hemorrhage, likely hypertensive in etiology, with intraventricular extension.
No significant interval change from outside hospital CT performed on [**2158-10-23**].
Radiology ReportCTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS Study Date of [**2158-10-23**] 7:10 PM  NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: The previously noted hematoma centered in the left thalamus, with extension into the corona radiata, is unchanged in size.
Surrounding edema is unchanged in extent.
Partial compression and mild rightward shift of the third ventricle are unchanged.
The lateral ventricles are unchanged in size without evidence of hydrocephalus at this time.
No new intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage is noted.
There is thickening of the posterolateral walls of the maxillary sinuses, suggestive of previous chronic sinusitis.
However, there is no evidence of sinusitis at this time.
There is no evidence of significant atherosclerosis or stenoses in the cervical common carotid, internal carotid, or vertebral arteries.
There is a 1.8 x 1.8 cm pulmonary lesion with spiculated margins in the imaged upper right lung (image 3:13).
This lesion is either cavitary or abuts a pre- existing cavity, such as a pneumatocele, bulla, or dilated bronchiole.
No evidence of lymphadenopathy is seen in the imaged superior mediastinum.
HEAD CTA: The intracranial internal carotid and vertebral arteries, and their major branches, are patent without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenoses or aneurysms.
There is no evidence of an arteriovenous malformation.
Unchanged appearance of the left thalamic/corona radiata hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.
No evidence of intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.

There is pooling of hyperdense material within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle that has minimally increased since the prior study.
There is no new mass effect or progression of shift of midline structures, seen on prior study.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage, mass effect, or infarction.
There are no fractures.
The inner ear cavity and included portions of the mastoid air cells are clear.
There is relative hypoattenuation of the periventricular white matter consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
No significant change in left thalamic hemorrhage.
Interval minimal increase of hemorrhage within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
No new hemorrhage or mass effect.
The lungs are clear bilaterally without evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
Aorta is somewhat tortuous with faint calcifications along the aortic knob.
CXR [**10-26**]   FINDINGS: Evaluation is limited by moderate right sided oblique position and rotation .
There is no focal  consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
CXR [**10-28**]  This examination is limited due to respiratory motion, no focal consolidation is noted.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Minimal bibasilar atelectases are greater on the left side.
CT chest [**10-29**] obtained to evaluate pulmonary nodule seen on CTA neck.
Right upper lobe mass-like consolidation with adjacent cyst less likely cavity.
Differential diagnosis would include focal area for infection (especially given the presence of left lower lobe consolidation and secretion in the trachea) as well as focal area of aspiration.
Focal consolidation in the lower lobes, left significantly more than right, highly suspicious for infection versus aspiration.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

The patient's symptoms were most likely secondary to the acute thalamic hemorrhage.
Based on the location and her elevated blood pressure on admission, this was suspected to likely be a hypertensive hemorrhage.
There was initial concern that she may also have an occlusion of the basilar artery, however a CTA was normal.
No other abnormalities of the on imaging were noted.
Her neurological exam improved in terms of mental status after extubation [**10-25**], with major deficit involving L gaze preference but movements past midline, R sided dense flacid hemiparesis.
She had minimal tone in RLE.
A dedicated chest CT on [**10-29**] showed a right upper lobe mass-like consolidation with adjacent cyst or less likely cavity, as well as bibasilar consolidations and tracheal secretions.
The etiology of this was felt to be a small consolidation over adjacent cyst/bulla in setting of probably aspiration pneumonitis initiated during/prior to intubation.
Patient did not have clinical signs of PNA on examination or by history (occasional cough, well maintained O2 saturations and no fevers), thus was not treated with antibiotics.
Should she develop fever or clinical signs of PNA, HAP coverage would be appropriate.
On admission the patient was noted to have a slight elevation in troponin, that peaked at 0.27, as well as ST segment elevations in V1-V3.
She also was noted to be intermittently bradycardic.
She was seen by cardiology, who recommended to start an aspirin 325 mg when stable from neurology perspective, statin and beta-blocker, but would not recommend further intervention at that time given the inability to anti-coagulate in the context of her acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
It was felt that her ECG changes were typical of anterior ischemia, but given low Trponin elevation and HTN, may have been due to her acute intracranial process as well as some demand ischemia by cardiology service.
Aspirin 81 mg was started on [**2158-11-1**] and given no further neurological deficits was increased to 325mg as per cardiology recommendations.
She was also started on Lisinopril 5mg daily on [**11-5**] for BP control.
Patient was also noted to have a 2:1 AV block in setting of tachycardia.
Patient was noted to have thrombophlebitis in L antecubital fossa at site of an old [**Hospital3 **] iv.
This was discontinued, however, the cord progressed and cellulities ensued, w/ subsequent ulceration of the skin and purulent material drainage noted on [**10-28**].
There was no flucuance by [**10-29**] or purulent discharge.
Although patient had b/l evidence of consolidations, this was felt to be due to aspiration in the peri-intubation period.
No clinical signs of pneumonia were noted.
Her WBC was persistently elevated in range of 11.5-12.5 throughout admission, felt to be due to thrombophlebitis.
There were no other signs of infection.
At time of discharge, left antecubital fossa erythema decreased with no purulent discharge.
Patient was noted to have a microcytic anemia.
Her guiac stool was negative.
- Septic thrombophlebitis - monitor sight for re-infection and apply dressing changes appropriately.
- Pulmonary  - follow up of right upper lobe mass like consolidation.
- Heme - outpatient evaluation of microcytic anemia.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to sudden onset weakness on your right side.
You were found to have a left basal ganglia hemorrhage.
This was felt to be due to poorly controlled hypertension.
In addition, your course was complicated by a myocardial infarction (STEMI) as well as an infection of your left arm at the site of an old IV site.
Should you develop worsening weakness, headache, numbness, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting or any other symptom please seek immediate care or go to the emergency room.
