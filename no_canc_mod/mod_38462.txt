Was diagnosed with supraventricular tacchycardia and was given adenosine and then lopressor to take at home.
On Monday, he had his port accessed for labs and he began to feel like he was "coming down with a cold" on tuesday afternoon.
He went to work today and around noon felt weak, developed abdominal pain radiating to his left shoulder, one episode of vomiting and low grade temp to 99.
He denies headache, meningismus, cp, sob, cough, change in abd pain from baseline, diarrhea, change in bowel habits, dysuria, rash, joint pain, hematochezia or melena.
No hiking or outdoor activities.
Mild epigastric tenderness.
EKG showed sinus tacchycardia.
PE since he couldnt get CTA because of contrast allergy.
Of note, per wife, the vanco was given slowly so red man syndrome less likely.

SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
In addition, there is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, preferentially within the left system, and also involving the posterior right biliary duct which arises from the left system, an anatomic variant.
There are equivocal areas of stenosis in the peripheral left system without evidence of central stenosis, although the evaluation of stenosis is limited by the presence of pneumobilia.
In the left lobe of the liver, there is subtle hyperemia in the arterial phase without evidence of abnormality in signal on the T2-weighted images suggestive of edema.
No enhancing liver lesions are identified.
Nodularity of the right adrenal gland is stable compared to the preoperative study.
The pancreatic parenchyma enhances homogeneously.
There are bilateral nonenhancing renal cysts.
There is mild perinephric fluid bilaterally, right greater than left.
There is mild thickening of the right lateral conal fascia which is probably postoperative.
Small foci of blooming artifact on the gradient-echo sequences within the mesentery near the area of surgery are likely related to hemosiderin and postoperative change.
No evidence of new mass or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
The lung bases demonstrate small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis, right greater than left.
Subtle hyperemia in the left lobe of the liver without evidence of edema, fluid collection, or central biliary stenosis.
Equivocal stenosis in the periphery of the left biliary system is difficult to evaluate given the presence of pneumobilia.
Findings could represent subclinical cholangitis, given biliary anastomoses.
Bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater than left, with associated atelectasis.

# Fever: Patient with fever to 102 and leukocytosis.
The differential includes portacath infection given recent manipulation and timing of the onset.
The patient also report abdominal pain and has h/o abdominal abscess, but patient has had pain at baseline.
CXR today showed haziness in R lower base concerning for early pna vs pulmonary edema.
UA negative making pna and UTI unlikely.
Pt has elevated liver enzymes that were normal on monday per patient.
No change in bowel habit, no signs of menigitis, no murmur on exam to suggest endocarditis.
Tick borne disease unlikely as pt does not have any pets and does not do outdoor activities at all.
MRI of abdomen was performed and found no intrabdominal abscess but subclinic cholangisit.
# Tacchycardia: Patient's HR was consistently 110-120s here.
Patient's ekg was c/w sinus tacchycardia.
He is mildly fluid responsive.
This could be due to sepsis as above.
Pt high risk for PE given onc hx, but no other signs of PE.
Not anemic, anxious or in pain.
# H/O SVT, currently sinus tacchycardia on ekg.
# ARF: likely prerenal in setting of possible sepsis .
# Transaminitis: likely related to volume depletion and sepsis.
# Anemia: crit at baseline to slightly higher.
# Pancreatic cancer: defer to primary onc team .
# Restless leg: cont mirapex .
# HTN: hold lopressor .
# GERD: cont prilosec .
Disp:*14 Tablet Sustained Release 12 hr(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Sepsis from Port infection .
Secondary Diagnosis: Pancreatic Cancer   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fevers a couple of days after having your port accessed.
An MRI of your abdomen was peformed which ruled out a fluid collection.
If you develope any of the following, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpatations, worsening of you abdominal pain, worsening diarrhea, fevers or chills, or nausea and vomiting, please call your doctor or go to your local emergency room.
