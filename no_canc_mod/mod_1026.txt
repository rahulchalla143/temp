Admission Date:  [**2129-9-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-9-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-7-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization and stent placement Temporary pacing wire placed immediately after catheterization, removed within 24 hours.
History of Present Illness: This is a 59 yo man with CAD s/p 3V CABG in [**2-27**], PVD, ESRD on HD, DM who presented for left sided chest pain, [**6-5**], sharp in nature without radiation, associated w/SOB and N/Vomiting x 1, +visual changes "blurry" started at 10PM last night, waking him from sleep and was ongoing.
He reported this as different from his typical anginal pain in that it was very sharp and localized as opposed to diffuse pressure.
He noted that he had been chest pain free since his recent hospital discharge [**2129-9-2**] and noted that he has been otherwise well.
His usual angina he describes as a "squeeze" brought on by exertion, and he experiences angina walking up hills and 1 flight of stairs.
Pt's pain decreased to [**2-5**] after morphine.
He denied any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He also denied recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems [**Last Name (un) **] notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
He did report chest pain with exertion as above.
CAD 2.
PVD, s/p stenting of the bilateral CIA's, L EIA and PCI of the left SFA 4.
HTN 5.
Dyslipidemia 7.
Family History: Mother and father with DM II.
Pt denied history of heart disease, sudden deaths.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the prior tracing there is no significant change."
[**2129-9-26**] (on transfer to CCU post-catheterization): EKG demonstrated sinus bradycardia with PR prolongation, occasional dropped beats and intermittent pacing.
TTE ([**2129-9-26**]): There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed three-vessel disease: --The LMCA had a distal taper with 60% stenosis and modest calcification.
--The LAD had proximal calcification with competitive flow distally.
--The LCx was a non-dominant vessel with a proximal 80% stenosis and modest calcification.
Successful stenting of the protected LM/LCx lesion with a 2.5x13 mm cypher stent which was postdilated to 2.75mm.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI 3 flow (see PTCA comments).
Cardiac catheterization [**9-26**], with LAD stenting and D1 POBA.
No right heart catheterization.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Extensive atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta and other abdominal vessels.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 7203**] is a 59 yo man with CAD s/p 3V CABG in [**2-27**], PVD, ESRD on HD, DM who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for chest pain and EKG changes.
#) CAD with unstable angina: EKG showed findings potentially consistent with inferior wall ischemia.
His first set of troponins was slightly elevated from baseline.
His chest pain improved incompletely on nitroglycerin drip.
His nitroglycerin drip was stopped for hemodialysis.
He was taken to the cath lab on [**9-26**], where he had a LAD stent and D1 rescue as noted above, but after which he had bradycardia and hypotension, unresponsive to atropine.
We narrowed his blood pressure medicine for discharge somewhat given the possibility that his bradycardia and hypotension may have been related to a failure to be able to compensate peripherally for a vagal episode.
Accordingly we discontinued labetalol and after observation in the CCU, started metoprolol and lisinopril, observed him to ensure there were no problems with these medications, and seeing good control and no episodes of hypotension, we discharged him to home.
#) Bradycardia with hypotension: As noted above, he had a brief period of rapid-onset bradycardia and hypotension immediately after his catheterization procedure.
We judged this to be most likely the result of a vagal effect combined with labetalol/diltiazem/nifedipine which did not allow for compensatory BP and PVR rise.
Additionally, medicines increased in the day prior to procedure should have reached peak or near-peak levels before the procedure.
There was no evidence of infection (no prodrome; no other indicators of sepsis like fever, increased organ failure, etc; a WBC rise was transient and likely stress-related).
#) Hyperkalemia - In addition to his bradycardia and hypotension, Mr [**Known lastname 7203**] was found to have a potassium of greater than 7 in this post-procedure time.
He had emergent dialysis at this point, after which he had a complete dialysis cycle the next day.
Notably, he had an acute rise in K in the post cath setting, despite a pre-cath dose of kayexelate.
This was likely secondary ESRD combined with transient poor perfusion preventing kidneys from excreting even the small amount of potassium which they generally contribute.
#) Congestive heart failure, [**Hospital1 7216**], grade II: Mr [**Known lastname 7203**] was clinically mildly overloaded by exam on arrival, with crackles at his lung bases.
However, as above, we were concerned that labetalol might have contributed to his episode of hypotension and bradycardia, and sent him home with metoprolol after a period of observation, as above.
#) ESRD: The patient had dialysis on his regular schedule of T/TH/Sat.
#) Access: PIV, L AV fistula for dialysis.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: 1)You were admitted to the hospital because of chest pain.
This can sometimes be a sign of problems with your heart.
This may prevent you from having chest pain in the future, and also may help to prevent future heart problems.
4)If you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or any other concerning symptoms please return to the emergency room.
