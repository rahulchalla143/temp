Selective coronary angiography showed right domianant system with occluded RCA with collaterals from left and right.
LAD and LCX had only mild disease.
Hemodynamic assessment showed normal left and right sided filling pressures without evidence of RV involvement/infarction.
Successful predilation using 2.5 X 20mm maverick balloon and 3.0 X 20mm Cross sail balloons, stenting using 3.0 X 33mm Rx and 3.0 X 18mm OTW Cypher stents and post dilating using  4.0 X 23mm Power sail balloon with thrmbectomy using the pronto catheter and angiogjet devices, of the completely occluded mid RCA with lesion reduction from 100% to 0%.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection and no embolisation.
Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute angioplasty and stenting of the RCA.
ECHO [**2114-12-6**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is normal (LVEF 60%); however, the inferior and posterior walls are mildly hypokinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No diagnostic change from the previous tracing of [**2114-12-5**].

#CARDIAC ischemia - s/p cypher stent to mid RCA - CE peaked 1.95 [**12-6**] early am - continued asa, plavix, integrillin (total 18 hrs only) - discontinued IV heparin - started lipitor 80, lft wnl and lipid panel (LDL 100) - started lopressor 12.5mg TID and added lisinopril 5mg PO QD - nitrates if recurrent CP pump - echo 45% EF and interoposterior hypokinesis - hemodynamically stable, fluid goal keep even - continued to monitor groin which was stable arrythmia - started lopressor - no telemetry events .
