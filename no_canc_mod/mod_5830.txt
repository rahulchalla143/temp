had been suffering through a cough and likely COPD exacerbation with pneumonia based on pervious pulmonary records.
According to family, patient was being suctioned when suddenly became unresponsive, was found to be flaccid by EMS with cold extremities.
was subsequently paralyzed with vecuronium (for an unknown reason) with resultant hypotension to 60's, ETT repositioned.
Placed patient again on levophed due to lower blood pressures.
Of note, was febrile to 102.7 the week before this admission, with green sputum and shortness of breath.
Past Medical History: (1) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
(2) Status post laryngeal cancer with permanent tracheostomy placed in [**2180**].
(3) Status post right upper lobectomy for lung cancer in [**2186**].
(4) Left ventricular dysfunction with inferior akinesis on echo.
(5) Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance.
(6) Prior polio with right lower extremity weakness.
Extensive smoking history, social drinking, no IVDU.
Family History: Non contributory  Physical Exam: VS: T 36, BP 115/52 (on levophed), 52, 100%, 24 (on vent) Gen: Occasionally responsive to commands HEENT:  PERRLA, EOMI, clear OP, MMM Neck:  supple CV:  RRR, -m/r/g, nl S1/S2 Lungs:  Decreased BS on R side, slightly wheezing, coarse breath sounds from mechanical ventilation.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**7-/2495**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2191-5-26**], moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with mild right ventricular enlargement is now identified.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of a primary pulmonary process.
Fluffy left mid and lower lung opacity could reflect infectious/post- obstructive or aspiration pneumonitis.
Given history of malignancy, lymphangitic carcinomatosis remains a differential consideration; however, no prior comparisons for accurate assessment are available.
Right hemithorax volume loss, but otherwise not evaluable due to rotation.
[**5-24**] CXR IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of left basilar airspace disease and stable left upper lobe airspace disease concerning for infection.
Superimposed infectious infiltrate or CHF cannot be excluded.

There is considerable respiratory motion blurring detail.
However, even allowing for differences in technique, the degree of opacity along the lateral aspect of the left chest appears more pronounced and confluent, particularly at the left lung base.
The appearance is more suggestive of parenchymal consolidation than of layering fluid and the opacity does not extendto directly abut the chest wall.
Although much of the abnormal appearance could relate to the patient's background COPD, the possibility of an acute superimposed pneumonic infiltrate must be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 10132**] is an 85 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for laryngeal CA s/p laryngectomy and trach, COPD, CAD admitted with unresponsiveness, dynamic ST-T wave abnormalities, shock, and respiratory failure.
Patient remained vasopressor and vent dependent with BAL growing Pseudomonas.
# Respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation: The patient presented with respiratory distress that was intially thought to be secondary to pneumonia in conjuction with volume overload.
# Unresponsiveness: This was intially noted in the setting of desaturation to mid to high 70s, and EKG demonstrating ST elevations.
Head CT was negative for bleeding.
# Troponin leak and ST elevations: These were most likely consistent with ACS.
Initially he received heparin IV but this was held given concern for active bleeding in the setting of HCT drop (requiring multiple transfusions) and skin echymosses.
# Hypotension: This was attributed to ACS and likely cardiogenic shock.
CT abd/pelvis showed some free fluid in abdomen but no blood.
Also, bilateral renal cysts evident.
Initially thought to be urine from bladder perforation, CT cystogram obtained which demonstrated no contrast extravasation into peritoneum.
