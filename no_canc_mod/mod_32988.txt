In the ER he was noted to have melena in his rectal tube.
He received ~1.5 L of fluid and had starte receiving 1 back of PRBCs prior to txfr to the ICU.
The pt appeared comfortable and denied abdominal pain, chest pain, lightheadedness or nausea.
Said he had fevers several weeks ago and one recent episode of emesis.
He thinks he may have had black stool for weeks.
Of note, pt recently admitted [**Date range (1) 77791**] for new atrial fibrillation, septic shock (urosepsis), and acute on chronic renal failure now requiring dialysis and was discharged to [**Hospital1 **].
Past Medical History: # DM2 # CRI (baseline 2.5)- recently started on HD # CHF # Trached and vent dependent [**1-17**] PNA in [**12-23**] # Morbid obesity # Afib on Coumadin # Hypercholesterolemia  Social History: Used to live with wife, who is HCP.
Family History: N/C  Physical Exam: VS: T:  HR: 120s BP: SBP 70s-90s  RR:  O2 sat: Gen: obese male, mentating appropriately, NAD, pale HEENT: anicteric sclera, dry MM Neck: supple, dialysis line in place Cardio: distant heart sounds, tachycardic, no murmur appreciated Pulm: CTAB anteriorly, no w/r/g Abd: soft, obese, NT, ND, +BS, G tube in place Ext: hyperpigmentation on shins, 1+ peripheral edema, 1+ DP pulses b/l Neuro: Alert, awake, mentating appropriately and responding to commands.
Probable atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
However, there are periods of regularization but no discernible flutter waves.
Heart is enlarged, pulmonary vascularity is engorged, and there is bilateral perihilar haziness attributed to pulmonary edema.
More confluent left retrocardiac opacification is present, likely a combination of atelectasis and moderate effusion, but underlying infectious consolidation is not excluded.
Small right pleural effusion is also evident.
There was a blood clot underneath the bumper suggesting a site of bleed.
It was washed, and did not reveal any visible vessel or active bleeding.
There was no fresh or old blood (except the clot under the bumper) seen in the stomach.
There was no fresh or old blood in the duodenum.
Erythema in the first and 2nd part of the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: - Bleeding likely to be from the site of the internal bumper of the PEG in the setting of high INR, but seems to have stopped now.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2150-4-4**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
Moderately dilated left ventricular cavity.
Thickened aortic leaflets without frank stenosis.
PORT  [**2150-4-13**] IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.
No collections identified.
Thin cortex bilaterally consistent with chronic interstitial disease.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-4-17**] FINDINGS: The image did not include the lung bases; however, there is opacification in the right lung base secondary to atelectasis and effusion.
The heart size is mildly enlarged and stable.
More opacification adjacent to the left heart border may indicate left lower lobe atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old male with h/o ESRD on HD, tracheostomy who initally presented with anemia and melena.
At rehab, he was found to have a drop in his hematocrit from 35 to 18.6 associated with hypotension and tachycardia.
GI was consulted and performed EGD on admission which demonstrated the source of bleeding to be most likely from the site of the internal bumper of the PEG in the setting of high INR, with no active bleeding noted.
Aspirin and coumadin were held in the setting of active GI bleeding.
# Acute blood loss anemia:  As above.
# Hypotension, Hemorrhagic, Hypovolemic and Septic:  Pt was initially hypotensive, likely hemorrhagic [**1-17**] GI bleed.
With aggressive IVF resuscitation and transfusions on admission, patient became volume overloaded.
He was also treated for UTI and bacteremia.
# Relative adrenal insufficiency:  Pt was started on a course of stress dose steroids after [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test had a less than target range increase after cosyntropin was administered.
This was discontinued after 6 days as he was not displaying other signs of adrenal insufficiency.
# Chronic kidney disease, stage V:  The patient was started on dialysis for renal insufficiency during his previous admission.
He was seen by renal while in the hospital, who felt he could benefit from CVVH while in the intensive care unit to help mobilize some of his fluid overload.
His temporary line was also tunneled in IR during this admission without complication.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  On admission, the patient was in afib with RVR.
# UTI:  Pt was found to have pan-resistant Klebsiella UTI and received a 10 day course of Meropenam.
Pt was treated with a 14 day course of Vancomycin given his hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated WBC at the time.
With mobilization of his excess fluid, the patient was weaned to a trach mask while in the hospital.
On [**4-20**] he desatted to 80%, in the setting of having increased volume (7L positive in the last two days).
He was requiring .7% FiO2, CXR showed partial collapse of his left lung.
Sputum culture from [**4-8**] showed acinetobacter and stenotrophomonas, initially not treated because it was felt these could be colonizers.
However, in the context of his increased oxygen requirement and cxr findings he was started on tobramycin and was already on vanc for a presumed line infection (positive blood cultures).
# ?MGUS:  Pt had an elevated kappan and lambda.
Clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 6-8 Puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Six (6) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: upper GI bleed urosepsis with ESBL Volume overload Hypotension .
Secondary: ESRD on dialysis Atrial fibrillation Urinary tract infection Bacteremia Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance Hyperlipidemia Type II Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a drop in your blood counts and melena (or blood in your stool).
While you were in the hospital, an EGD showed a clot around your PEG tube site, which likely contributed to your bleeding.
You had alot of fluid removed in dialysis and your current weight, which is your dry weight is 147 kg.
You were also on CVVH, a type of dialysis, while you were in the hospital to help remove some of the excess fluid in your tissues.
During work up of causes of renal failure, you were noted to have abnormal blood tests leading to a bone marrow biopsy.
You were also treated for a urinary tract infection and bacteria in your blood with antibiotics.
In addition you were started on tobramycin for acetinobacter and stentrophomonas in your sputum when your oxygen requirement increased.
If you have more bleeding from the rectum, vomiting of blood, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, palpitations, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, please call your primary care provider or go to the Emergency Department.
