ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Again seen is an intratrochanteric fracture line.
An intramedullary nail with single distal screw and trochanteric fixation rod has been placed.
CXR [**2108-5-25**]: Left upper lobe pneumonia is obscured by new complete collapse of the left lung accompanied by at least a small volume of pleural effusion secondary to pulmonary processes.
Two 4-mm wide metallic opacities projecting over the upper stomach have migrated inferiorly along the course of the esophagus from positions in the upper chest from [**5-26**] and 29.
