FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates a left pleural effusion which has increased in size.
There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity.
There is a new focal opacity in the right middle lobe which obscures the right heart border.
While this was not present on the most recent prior examination, enhancement seen on other prior studies and is most likely an area of recurrent atelectasis, however, a developing pneumonia cannot be excluded at this site.
New right middle lobe opacity either representing atelectasis versus developing pneumonia.
Left pleural effusion which appears to have increased in size and associated persistent left retrocardiac density.
There is no sign of intraluminal thrombus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of venous thrombosis.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2155-10-24**] 11:37 AM  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  Reason: ABD PAIN Field of view: 36  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 83 year old F with ischemic left foot, severe PVD, CHF, DIC who initially complained of abdominal pain with elevated lactate, now stable for CT. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ?PLEASE R/O MESENTERIC ISCHEMIANO IV CONTRAST PLEASE - ARF CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: acute renal failure  INDICATION: 83 year old with severe peripheral vascular disease, CHF, who initially complained of abdominal pain with elevated lactate.
Assess for mesenteric ischemia.
IV contrast was not administered secondary to the ordering physician's request.
CT OF ABDOMEN W/O IV CONTRAST: The imaged portions of the lung bases demonstrate an interval increase in the size of bilateral pleural effusions, now large on the right and moderate on the left.
There is also increased opacification of the right middle lobe, with intervening air bronchograms.
There is stable cardiomegaly with prominence of the right atrium.
There is a new small amount of perihepatic ascites and increased subcutaneous edema within the soft tissues of the posterior abdomen.
There is diffuse wall calcification of the intra-abdominal aorta.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction, wall thickening, or air within the bowel walls.
CT OF PELVIS W/O IV CONTRAST: There is increased fatty stranding/fluid density within the presacral space.
Bone windows again show diffuse degenerative changes of the visualized spine.
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
These images also show no secondary signs of acute mesenteric ischemia.
Allowing for this limitation, there are no secondary signs of acute/chronic mesenteric ischemia.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
2) Interval increase in the size of bilateral pleural effusions.
3) Right middle lobe pneumonia.
4) New small amount of perihepatic ascites and evidence of third spacing of fluids within the dependent subcutaneous soft tissues and presacral space.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2155-10-24**] 11:39 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: ?CVA ?cause of altered mental status  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 83 year old woman with ischemic left foot, CHF, DIC who has been having mental status changes, now stable for CT. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ?CVA ?cause of altered mental status CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Ischemic left foot, CHF, DIC, who has now been having mental status changes, evaluate for CVA or intracranial bleed.
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: There are multiple chronic lacunar infarcts, most prominent in the lentiform nuclei and internal capsules bilaterally.
Additionally, there is evidence of periventricular hypodensity in the white matter of the cerebrum, consistent with chronic small vessel ischemia.
There is no obvious blurring of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white interface or sulcal effacement to suggest acute infarction.
Additionally, there is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
There is mild sulcal prominence consistent with age related atrophic changes.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
No evidence to suggest acute infarction.
Multiple chronic lacunar infarcts and changes consistent with chronic small vessel ischemia as described above.
PORT  Reason: ?hydro, renal infarct, cz of decreased uop  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 83 year old woman with history of renal artery stenosis s/p stent now with acute renal failure REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ?hydro, renal infarct, cz of decreased uop INDICATION: Renal artery stenosis status post stenting.
Acute renal failure.
Decreased urine output.
No nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis or renal mass is detected.
A small amount of pericholecystic fluid is noted.
Small pericholecystic fluid.
Brief Hospital Course: [**2155-4-17**] - EF 55-60% mild symm LVH, RV mildly dilated, 1+ AR, 1+MR  Altered mental status had an initial unclear etiology.
Patient had an elevated lactate  with a gas consistent with metabolic acidosis.
Patient also has abdominal pain and there was some concern for bowel ischemia.
Patient had a negative head CT.
Patient also was initially anuric and bladder scan indicated no urine in the bladder.
Renal us was negative for masses and hydronephrosis.
5 mL of urine was obtained and spinning the urine revealed questionable muddy brown casts.
Patient produced 30 cc of urine after a small fluid bolus and urine lytes indicates ATN most likly secondary to hypotension.
(Cr: 1.9) Patient had elevated lactate (9.6), increased INR (3.4), low-normal fibrinogen, elevated white count (14), FDP- 80-160, D Dimer- 6569  and patient was thought to be in DIC.
Question of whether this was urosepsis vs sequelae of ischemic foot.
Initially she was not a surgical candidate secondary to DIC, but once this resolved, vascular surgery felt patient was not a candidate for thrombectomy, and would need BKA.
Long discussion with patient and family, and it was decided that patient did not want BKA and would be convered to CMO.
In addition, while in hospital, patients BP and HR were very elevated most likely secondary to foot pain.
Abdominal pain resolved.
She was dced  home on hospice with palliative medication.
