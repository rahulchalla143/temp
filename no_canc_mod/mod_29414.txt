She coughed up 1 teaspoon of blood the first time ~4wks ago and she was treated with a z-pak for bronchitis; then another episode of coughing spasm 1 wk later w/~[**1-18**] cup blood she was treated with 10 days of levofloxacin for possible PNA.
The fever and cough seemed to resolve and she did not have any more episodes of hemoptysis until Wed night, 3 days prior to presentation.
At that time She had coughing and small volume-1 teaspoon-of hemoptysis.
It resolved until the next morning when she had another episode of hemoptysis which again was ~[**1-18**] cup and her daughter brought her to the [**Name (NI) **].

She was active and did not have any ongoing medical problems.
Since the illness, she has had a 10lbs weight loss.
No hematemesis/abdominal pain, no diarrhea/hematochezia.
+ night sweats with the febrile illness 4wks ago, none since or prior.

Unusual airspace consolidation in the left upper lobe, anterior segment with central foci of hypodensity.
Additional findings of scattered ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe adjacent to the dense consolidation.
Overall, findings are most likely related to an infectious etiology (must consider tuberculosis), though other considerations include mucoid impaction or neoplasm.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Calcified mediastinal, hilar, and mesenteric lymph nodes with calcified granulomas in the lung and liver, compatible with prior granulomatous disease (patient is known to have had prior treated tuberculosis).
Multiple segmental and subsegmental right-sided pulmonary emboli.
Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis, with new regions of consolidation as outlined above.
Region of consolidation/mass in the anterior left upper lobe now contains a small focus of air.
Specifically, there is continued improvement of the previously noted left upper lobe anterior segement consolidation which suggests that it is likely to be infectious in etiology.
Occlusive DVT in the right brachial and cephalic veins.
Partially occlusive DVT in the right internal jugular vein.
Echogenic, noncompressible material in the left axillary and subclavian veins most consistent with partially occlusive catheter- associated thrombus.
Less likely this could represent chronic wall thickening in these vessels.
The patient was bronched looking for the source of the bleeding , but no source was found.
The next day, there was an episode of hemoptysis again, and the patient was again bronched.
The patient was stable and did not have another hemoptysis.
Lower extremity doppler was done and no DVT was found.
The patient developed contrast nephropathy from the CTA which slowly self resolved over the enxt few days.
An upper extremety ultrasound was done and it showed bilateral clots, but no treatment was undertaken because of the recent history of hemoptysis.
Patient developed MSSA bactermia and was started on Naficillin and Clindamycin.
The symptoms were suspicious for TB because of the LUL cavitary mass.
There was noted development of bilateral plerual effusions despite normal cardiac function.
<br> HOSPITAL COURSE  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the medicine floor extubated and without episodes of hemoptysis in the last five days.
therapy for possible TB infection and Naficillin for MSSA bacteremia.
Family refused further TB treatment that night and, after consult with pulmonology and ID the medical team discontinued the R.I.P.E.
On the second day of her admission Ms. Y developed several episodes of watery diarrhea and was put on Metronidazole.
Since she had bilateral upper extremity thrombi it was not possible to put a picc line in for at home administration of antibiotics.
In addition, the medical team deemed it necessary to begin anticoagulation to manage the bilateral UE DVTs and subsegmental pulmonary emboli found on the MICU CTA.
She remained stable without signs of bleeding and it was decided to increase her dose to IV heparin.
She had a final repeat CT which showed improvement of the left upper lobe lesion and complete resolution of the bilateral pleural effusions.
