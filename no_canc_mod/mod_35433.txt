He received 100 cc fluid, no blood loss.
He was extubated in the PACU and complained of sob and epigastric tightness similar to previous MI he had last week.
EKG showed LBBB with left anterior fasicular block at rate 105.
CXR was obtained and showed enlarged heart, pulm vasc engorged, minimal perihilar haziness, mild edema.
No focal consolidations.
Initially his breathing was labored and he complained of sob but this improved with some suctioning.

Admitted to ICU due to hypotension following procedure, suspected biliary sepsis.
# Hypotension/biliary sepsis: In PACU received 500 cc LR and neo gtt.
CVP 12-17 so spoke against volume depletion and patient did not lose any blood during procedure per anesthesia.
Hematocrit stable and no evidnece of active bleeding.
Possibilities for hypotension included sepsis given white count 46, fever, biliary source.
CXR without consolidation.
Cardiogenic shock also suspected given recent NSTEMI and known CHF with EF 35%.
No evidence of tamponade on EKG and patient does not have muffled heart sounds or elevated JVD.
TTE showed reduced LVEF 20-25%, no evidence of tamponade.
Blood, sputum cultures with no growth.
# Hypoxia, resolved: Likely due to mucous plugging at presentation as patient had secretions per anesthesia.
Also likely component of volume overload seen on cxr and pt has known chf.
# Cholangitis/sepsis: s/p ERCP.
WBC, LFTS still elevated but coming down.
On admission, biliary sepsis covered with Zosyn; also started vancomycin initially empirically.
In ICU, has been afebrile and without abdominal discomfort.
# CAD/NSTEMI: Patient with recent NSTEMI and hypotension.
EKG unchanged but difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB which is old.
Beta-blocker restarted after hypotension resolved.
# chronic systolic heart failure: Patient with history of EF 35%.
Given poor renal function, did not start ACE inhibitor given acute renal failure.
Patient discharged on Hydralazine & Isosorbide dinitrate for afterload reduction.
# acute renal failure/chronic kidney disease stage III: Creatinine resolving thoughout admission.
