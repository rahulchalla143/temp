Admission Date:  [**2122-10-23**]       Discharge Date:   Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 92935**] is an 85 year old man with a past medical history significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for the preceding one year, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% to 45% in [**2121-11-12**], who presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2122-10-23**] with a complaint of one month of progressive dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea plus a one day history of substernal/epigastric chest pressure.
In the Emergency Room, the patient was found to be in atrial flutter with a ventricular rhythm in the 150s, blood pressure 128/94, respiratory rate 34 to 40 and an oxygen saturation of 95%, with an examination consistent with congestive heart failure.
There was no improvement in his hemodynamic status, and evidence of worsening congestive heart failure despite initial treatment with intravenous diltiazem 70 mg, intravenous Lopressor 40 mg and intravenous Lasix 40 mg.  DC cardioversion was attempted twice, with reversion to a nodal rhythm with a heart rate in the 40s and a blood pressure of 80 to 120/palpable.
At that point, there was worsening hypoxia and cyanosis, and the patient was intubated.
The intubation was traumatic and required multiple attempts before successful endotracheal placement was achieved.
He remained hypotensive and bradycardiac and received Atropine once before being started on a Dopamine drip.
The patient was initially admitted to the Coronary Care Unit team for management of his congestive heart failure.
He was then transferred one day later to the Medical Intensive Care Unit service with rising creatinine, rising liver function tests and concern for aspiration pneumonia.
Given his aspiration, bilateral infiltrates on a chest x-ray, hypoxia and poor pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, there was an initial concern that he was entering acute respiratory distress syndrome.
However, he did not have difficulty with ventilation or oxygenation and was quickly weaned down on his FiO2, eventually being weaned from the ventilator by [**2122-11-5**].
The patient had elevated troponin levels post cardioversion, with slightly elevated CK and a peak CK/MB of 10.
It was unclear whether he had actually suffered a myocardial infarction in the setting of his presentation.
A transthoracic echocardiogram at this point showed depressed left ventricular systolic function and his major cardiac issues in this admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit were rate control and rhythm.
Shortly after his admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient reverted to rapid atrial fibrillation and was controlled with nodal ablations.
He was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for concern for aspiration pneumonia.
His transaminases peaked in the 5,000 to 7,000 range following his episode of hypotension and then continued to decline.
The patient's neurological status was depressed during his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay, presumed to be secondary to an undetermined period of hypoxia during his initial presentation as well as large doses of Ativan and fentanyl for sedation while he was intubated.
On [**2122-11-5**], the patient was transferred to the floor, where he stayed briefly, however, he had persistent agitation, requiring a one-to-one sitter and a significant amount of Haldol.
His examination was notable for the development of decreased breath sounds and crackles at the left base.
He was also found to have a rising temperature to 100.9 and laboratory data remarkable for a rising white blood cell count.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Anicteric sclerae, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, moist mucous membranes, no oral lesions.
Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy, jugular venous distention more or less 8 cm.
Cardiovascular: Irregularly irregular rhythm, S1 and S2 normal, II/VI systolic ejection murmur at apex.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, mildly distended, positive bowel sounds in all four quadrants, no rebound or guarding, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube in place.
Extremities:  Poor distal pulses, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Chest x-ray showed no cardiomegaly, pulmonary vasculature normal, persistent opacification of the retrocardiac space which was stable in appearance but most likely represented atelectasis versus pneumonia.
Echocardiogram from [**2122-11-13**] showed mildly dilated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with overall severe depression of left ventricular systolic function and severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, mild aortic insufficiency, mild mitral regurgitation, no significant change from prior study of [**2122-10-26**].
Cardiovascular:  Initially, the patient's atrial fibrillation with a rapid rate was difficult to control.
This procedure was performed on [**2122-10-30**] without complications.
It was felt that congestive heart failure continued to contribute somewhat to his pulmonary picture and he was restarted on a small dose of Lasix, with good effect.
His speech remained somewhat dysarthric and he failed a subsequent swallowing study.
However, he will require rehabilitation for his neurological issues.
This dictation will be followed by an addendum detailing his further course as well as his discharge destination status and medications.
