right base increased opacification, no definite volume overload, likely atelectasis.
ST depressions in I but may be due to baseline artifact.
Resolution of the left lower lobe consolidation with residual left lower lobe atelectasis and mild bronchiectasis.
New multifocal ground-glass opacities with mild bronchiolectasis and bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening and centrilobular nodules are likely due to a combination of recurrent aspiration--the patient has a moderate-to-large hiatal hernia--and concurrent atypical infection, probably viral.
Minimal increase in right lower lobe well-circumscribed nodule could be accounted for by differences in technique; follow up in one year would be prudent.
Diffuse triple vessel coronary artery and aortic valve calcification.
No free air is identified.
There are no significant air-fluid levels on what appears to be a lateral decubitus view.
His course almost always includes aspiration pneumonitis, and to some degree renal failure due to hypotension.
He did not respond to shaking or loud voice.
His symptoms improved initially on the first day, and he became more alert and was weaned of supplemental oxygen.
However the next day patient became somnolent again and poorly responsive.
Due to concern for aspiration and his hypoxia 85% RA, he was transferred to the ICU where he received broad spectrum antibiotics for possible nosocomial pneumonia (Meropenem, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin).
The episode was thought to be due to aspiration pneumonitis.
His somnolence was thought to be due to hoarding his medication with intentional overdose.
The MRSA colonies in his sputum were thought to represent colonization rather true MRSA pneumonia.
The benign clinical presentation was most consistent with simple pneumonitis rather than any infection.
He complained of diffuse body pain throughout the admission, which was noted during multiple previous admissions.
He had no objective findings for his pain.
The remainder of his hospital course is significant for his poor cooperation with medical, nursing, and physical therapy staff.
He refused to ambulate with assistance on multiple occasions due to pain and weakness, however when he felt unattended, he ambulated freely without support in his room from bed to bathroom.
