He took non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs with no relief of the temperature and no relief of the symptoms.
The patient then stated on Saturday symptoms progressively got worse with increased fatigue, anorexia and increase in his nonproductive cough.
The patient presented to the Emergency Department with these symptoms with no recent history of sick contacts, travel exposure or recent admissions for pneumonia or any pulmonary symptoms or pulmonary diagnoses.

Cardiovascular S1 and S2 tachy and irregular heart rate.
Pulmonary bibasilar crackles, decreased breath sounds at the right base.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Initial chest x-ray showed right lower lobe infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 169, repeat electrocardiogram also showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 129 with a right bundle branch block.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with a diagnosis of pneumonia and because of the increased lactic acid value the Must protocol was put into place for rule out of sepsis.
The patient was also found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid rate with a right bundle branch block.
Throughout the hospital course the patient did not have any atrial fibrillation once being transferred up to the medical floors nor did he have a rapid rate or right bundle branch block.
Sputum cultures were not obtained due to no production of cough.
Blood cultures continued upon discharge showed no growth.
Chest x-ray showed resolving right lower lobe pneumonia.
For his diabetes he was started on an insulin sliding scale and Metformin was held due to his increased creatinine.
The patient's creatinine did decrease down to baseline, which was 1.2 to 1.3 during hospital stay, because of adequate fluid hydration and because of decreased signs of infection.
Upon discharge he had been afebrile for 48 hours.
The patient also had been ruled out for myocardial infarction during admission and because vital signs stayed stable while in the Intensive Care Unit it was not assumed that he was in an active sepsis.
No signs of endocarditis and mild mitral regurgitation.
[**First Name (STitle) **] the patient was evaluated as being afebrile for greater then 48 hours and for having a decreasing white blood cell count and improving oxygenation and although he had been up to 4 liters while in house he was now on no supplemental oxygen and was satting 100 percent.
