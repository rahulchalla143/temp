Pt had been treated for pneumonia with resp sx's x2 weeks.
On arrival, the patient was noted to have a LBBB.
She was initially afebrile at 98.5, HR 100s, BP 90/, O2 sat 90% on RA.
On arrival, pt had low grade temp 100.2, HR 105, BP 94/64.
Sclera anicteric.
No thrills, lifts.
bibasilar crackles with good air entry b/l, no wheezes.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
Patient with pleural effusion.
There is again seen a left retrocardiac opacity and a left-sided pleural effusion.
There is some atelectasis at the right base and a small right-sided pleural effusion.
There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mild symmetric LVH.
Severely depressed LVEF.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Moderate to severe (3+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Results  were Conclusions: PRE CPB The pre-bypass study was limited by the fact that the patient became unstable and was quickly and urgently placed on bypass.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are  mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Left ventricular systolic function is markedly improved.
Poor acoustic windows prevent the exclusion of a regional wall motion abnormality.
There is a bioprosthesis in the aortic position.
There is very trace valvular AI.
A perivalvular jet is not obvious but poor windows prevent complete exclusion.

The ICA/CCA ratio is 0.78 and this is consistent with a widely patent left ICA.
IMPRESSION: There is a widely patent right ICA and a widely patent left ICA with antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.

On POD2 she experienced multipple episode of atrial fibrillation and was started on Beta blockade and Amiodarone and converted to sinus rhythm.
Call for any fever, redness or drainage from wounds.
