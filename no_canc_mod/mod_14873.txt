ECG showed small ST depressions, but was ruled out for an MI.
He then had a stress MIBI which was postive for symptoms and ST depressions.
Also revealed small reversible inferior defect and old fixed defect.
Past Medical History: Coronary Artery Disease s/p s/p NSTEMI w/ PTCA/Stenting to RCA in [**2136**] and again in [**2138**] Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Diabetes Mellitus Peripheral Neuropathy Chronic Renal Insufficiency  Social History: Lives with wife.

Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system status post RCA stenting.
The LMCA showed a complex 80% distal stenosis with involvement of the LAD and LCX ostia.
The LAD showed a 70% ostial stenosis with 70% stenosis of the D1.
The LCX showed an ostial 80% stenosis with diffuse disease, including a 50% midsegment stenosis.
The RCA showed sequential 80% and 70% instent restenoses within the most proximal RCA stent, with milder 20-30% restenosis of the mid and distal stents.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen in suboptmal views (cannot exclude).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Head CT Scan [**2139-12-10**]: There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are unremarkable, without effacement.
There does seem to be a slice through the suprasellar cistern, which is missing, limiting evaluation but the other slices suggest no abnormality.
There is no mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of the normally midline structures.
Carotid Ultrasound [**2139-12-11**]: Significant amount of plaque at the origins of the bilateral internal carotid arteries, associated with luminal narrowing estimated between 80 and 99% in diameter on both sides.
EEG [**2139-12-11**]: Abnormal EEG due to the presence of diffuse background slowing and superimposed bursts of generalized mixed frequency delta and theta slowing.
No focal or epileptiform features were seen.
Common causes of encephalopathy include medications, metabolic causes, and infectious processes.
Brain MRI [**2139-12-12**]: The diffusion images demonstrate subtle areas of slow diffusion in the right frontal cortical region with a small area of subcortical acute infarct in the right frontal lobe.
A similar small area of signal abnormality is seen on diffusion images in the left parietal cortical region.
The findings are suggestive of acute infarcts.
There is no mass effect, midline shift, or hydrocephalus seen.
There are no chronic territorial infarcts visualized.
There is no evidence of significant subcortical white matter ischemic disease seen.
Patient had usual work-up along with an echocardiogram - see above results.
He required foley reinsertion at that time for urinary retention but did not become oliguric.
Mr. [**Known lastname 52049**] [**Last Name (Titles) 52050**] experienced altered mental status, along with fluctuations in level of alertness and incoherent speech.
A head CT scan on [**12-10**] showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or of acute territorial infarction.
Carotid ultrasound was notable for bilateral carotid disease, report stating that there was a significant amount of plaque at the origins of the bilateral internal carotid arteries, associated with luminal narrowing estimated between 80 and 99% in diameter on both sides.
An EEG on [**12-11**] was deemed abnormal due to the presence of diffuse background slowing and superimposed bursts of generalized mixed frequency delta and theta slowing.
No focal or epileptiform features were seen.
Findings were suggestive of an encephalopathy.
MRI imaging of the brain on [**12-12**] was notable for findings suggestive of small acute cortical and subcortical infarcts in the right frontal lobe and possibly in the left parietal lobe.
There was no evidence of mass effect or hydrocephalus.
He continued to make clinical improvements with medical therapy and made steady progress with physical therapy.
Also at discharge, he was voiding without difficulty.
