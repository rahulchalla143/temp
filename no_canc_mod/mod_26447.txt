Admission Date: [**2193-6-19**]        Discharge Date: [**2193-6-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2147-1-13**]        Sex:  M  Service:  LIVER TRANSPLANT SURGERY SERVICE   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 63574**] was a 46 year-old gentleman with a long history of end stage liver disease secondary to alcohol, diabetes that was transferred from [**State 1558**], [**Hospital1 189**], on [**2193-6-19**] to the [**Hospital1 69**] for evaluation of possible liver transplant.
His premorbid condition remained somewhat unclear at the time of his transfer but by patient report, records, and family information he had had a long history of bacteremia and hypotension who presented to [**State 1558**] on [**2193-5-28**] with fever and change in mental status.
In the [**State 1558**] emergency department he was found to be febrile with a hematocrit of 23% and worsening hypotension.
Blood cultures drawn at the time of admission to the emergency department showed 4 out of 4 positive for streptococcus salivarius.
On hospital day 3 patient began to show signs of worsening hepatic failure including change in mental status and hypotension.
He developed a gastrointestinal bleed and was ultimately intubated for airway protection on [**2193-6-9**].
It was agreed that the patient would be transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for evaluation for possible liver and/or kidney-liver transplant.
End stage liver disease secondary to alcohol.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Right femoral neck fracture, status post open reduction,    internal fixation on [**2190-9-7**], procedure complicated    by MRSA infection.
Multiple episodes of bacteremia including most recently    MRSA bacteremia in [**2191-6-7**], pseudomonas bacteremia in    [**2191-8-8**] and strep viridans bacteremia in [**Month (only) **]    [**2191**].
Osteoporosis with multiple compression fractures of T3,    T7, T12, L1, L3, L5.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Grade 2 esophageal varices.
Skin color consistent with jaundice.
Sclerae noted to be markedly icteric.
Pulmonary examination: Coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Abdomen is extremely obese without any obvious hepatomegaly or any obvious spider angiomatas.
The Swan was floated successfully showing mild cardiogenic shock and dehydration.
Initial evaluation at that time by the transplant team concluded that the patient's presentation was most consistent with resolving sepsis, acute renal failure and possibly adult respiratory distress syndrome.
It was felt given that the family still was quite interested in possible transplant candidacy it was felt that additional work up was necessary.
Infectious disease consultation felt that the patient had multiple possible sources for sepsis and final antibiotic course regimen including Vancomycin, meropenum, caspofungin was selected.
At that time HIV testing was necessary to assess patient's candidacy for transplant.
Ammonia level check shortly after arrival in the Intensive Care Unit showed ammonia to be 69.
Over the course of several family discussions including the chief resident and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 228**] family began to inquire about changing the patient's status to Do Not Resuscitate, Do No Intubate.
Given the patient's increasing coagulopathy, sepsis and circulatory collapse he was not longer being considered a good candidate for liver recipient and the family's request was thought to not be unreasonable.
