Pt had a cardiac cath at NEBH in [**12-8**].
Then [**12-9**] he developed chest pain and ruled in for MI with a troponin of 6.5.He had a cardiac cath at [**Hospital1 18**] at that time which showed a valve area of 0.8 with a mean gradient of 34 and an EF of 40%.
The study showed significant native CAD but all grafts were patent.He declined intervention at that time because he was going to [**State 108**] for the winter.
When he returned this spring he was complaining of increased dyspnea on exertion.
He had a cardiac cath [**2103-6-6**] at NEBH which showed severe aortic stenosis and a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.6 cm2 and a mean gradient of 34-35 mmHg.
This catheterization also showed severe 3 vessel native CAD.
The vein graft to the PDA was patent with a significant lesion in the native vessel downstream from the graft.
The vein graft to diagonal branch is patent with distal native vessel severe disease and patent saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal with diffuse attenuation of native vessels.

The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate right pleural effusion.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position.
No paravalvular leak.
Mitral regurgitation is 1+.
The size of the left pleural effusion is significantly reduced.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition on Epinephrine and Neosynephrine  for optimal hemodynamic support.
Upon extubation he was found to be restless and somewhat agitated.
This was initially felt to be from the narcotics he had received however these symptoms persisted.
The neurology team was consulted and a head CT was done(A preliminary report read "No hemorrhage or large territorial infarct.
Ill-defined low attenuation foci in the right frontal centrum semiovale/corona radiata white matter (2:25-28), may represent infarcts, age indeterminate).
He was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 656**] who felt the patient did not have a new infarct.
Once on the floor he was noted to have a small amount of serous drainage from the inferior aspect of his sternal wound and was prophylactically started on Keflex.
Over the next several days he made slow but continuous  progress in his physical activity and on POD #12 he was cleared for discharge by the cardiac surgery covering attendings, to home with VNA.
