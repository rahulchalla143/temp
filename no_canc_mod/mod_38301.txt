He had no other neurologic deficits per report.
He does not have any history of clotting or DVT.
MRI head showed multiple right frontal infarcts likely representing embolic stroke (while on ASA).
They also requested a cardiology consulted to evaluate the patient as a candidate for dabigatran (traveling prevents him for frequent INR checks) as well as a possible TEE to look for the source of his embolic stroke.
TEE showed a ?papillary fibroelastoma on the aortic valve (0.4 x 0.5 cm), non-coronary cusp, with mild (1+) aortic regurgitation.
Negative for PFO or atrial clot.

Pertinent Results: Cardiac Echocardiogram: TEE [**2168-2-29**] [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.There is no evidence of LA contrast and no evidence of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] appendage clot.
A mass is present on the aortic valve(0.4 by0.5 cm).
The appearance of this mass suggests a fibroelastoma.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No filling defect is identified.
There is a small amount of scattered atherosclerotic calcification.
There is no significant pleural or chest wall abnormality.
Degenerative changes are present in the spine.
ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: There are two tiny hypodensities in the right lobe of the liver.
The pancreas, spleen and adrenal glands appear normal.
No lymphadenopathy is identified.
There are small bilateral well-circumscribed low density lesions in the kidneys.
Small bilateral lesions are too small to accurately characterize by CT.
There is a well-circumscribed irregularly shaped 1.4 cm calcific density along the right posterior, dependent wall of the urinary bladder.
There is a tiny fat-containing paraumbilical hernia.
There is narrowing of the L4-5 and L5-S1 intervertebral discs and there are degenerative changes in the spine.
Small sclerotic lesions in multiple bones are most consistent with bone islands.
IMPRESSION: RENAL CYSTS  MRI/MRA HEAD/NECK&MR BRAIN  [**2168-2-27**] [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] FINDINGS: MRI:  There are a few areas of small acute infarct seen in the right posterior frontal and anterior parietal cortical region as well as in the deep white matter of the right posterior frontal lobe.
There is no midline shift seen.
No evidence of blood products identified.
Mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease identified.
Following gadolinium, no abnormal enhancement is seen.
IMPRESSION: SMALL AREAS OF ACUTE INFARCT IN THE RIGHT POSTERIOR FRONTAL AND ANTERIOR PARIETAL LOBES AS WELL AS THE ADJACENT DEEP WHITE MATTER.
SMALL VESSEL DISEASE.
NO ENHANCING BRAIN LESION.
MRA OF THE NECK: The 3D time-of-flight gadolinium enhanced MRA is limited secondary to delayed acquisition.
The 2D time-of-flight MRA however, gives adequate evaluation of the carotid bifurcations and vertebral arteries demonstrate no stenosis or occlusion.
MRA HEAD: The head MRA demonstrates slightly tortuous vertebrobasilar system but no evidence of stenosis, occlusion or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size seen.
IMPRESSION: NO SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITIES ON MRA OF THE HEAD   Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old male with a hx of hyperlipidemia presents to OSH with acute right frontal embolic CVA, work-up remarkable for ?papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve on TEE, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
Given that this patient has become symptomatic and is at further increased risk of complications including MI and additional embolic strokes, evaluation for excision of this tumor was warranted.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD **** the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
To note -  Embolic CVA [**1-27**] aortic valve growth (as above): MRI read as embolic strokes, not hemorrhagic, and patient anticoagulated to prevent further propagation.
MRA neck negative for carotid disease and therefore a carotid ultrasound did not need to be performed.
