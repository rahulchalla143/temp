CXR: Improving pulmonary edema with a decrease in the size of the now tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
Multiple chronic compression deformities of the thoracic vertebral bodies.
pCXR: Mild pulmonary edema has improved since [**4-9**].
Pleural effusion has decreased or resolved.
No pneumothorax.
SOB: On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], had signs of volume overload on CXR (and elevated BNP).
History seems more consistent with flash pulmonary edema, in the setting of afib with RVR.
She may have bronchitis (no definite inflitrate on CXR) that could have been the inciting event for afib.
CHF: preserved EF but severe MR (so likely overestimated EF).
