Brief Hospital Course: # Hypotension: Thought to be related to two factors, 1) hypovolemia from recent diarrheal illness and 2) medication effect from multiple anti-hypertensives as well as decreased clearance of atenolol due to Acute on Chronic Renal failure.
Patients was volume resucitated and anti-hypertensives as well as narcotics were held and his SBP (nadir was 70) increased eventually to 140 upon discharge.
Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim from 15 at time 0 and a cortisol of 33 at time 60 minutes.
# ARF- Acute on Chronic renal failure, likely due to pre-renal causes as patient had a diarrheal illness for 5 days which resolved a few days prior to admission, and his renal failure improved with 4 liters of fluid resuscitation- back to his baseline.
# Anemia- Slightly worse than previous, retic 1.8%.
# Fall- per patient his fall was completely mechanical, his ankle pain caused his instability.
He has chronic ankle pain from previous trauma and is scheduled for surgical correction in roughly 1 week.
Pain medications were decreased to oxycontin 20mg po bid from 40mg po bid, patient's pain was well controlled on this regimen, he should uptitrate as outpatient with his PCP as his blood pressure allows if his pain worsens.
# Cardiac: Trop Peak at 0.04, likely insignificant in setting of renal failure.
# Depression / Suicidal- post discharge from psych facility patient no longer feels suicidal.
# Hyperkalemia- This was in the setting of his acute renal failure, it resolved and was stable upon discharge, he was placed on half of his home dose of HCTZ (12.5mg po daily).
Quetiapine 25 mg PO TID as needed for anxiety.
Quetiapine 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for anxiety.

You were found to have a very low blood pressure thought to be related to your medications as well as your worsening renal function (one of your medications, Atenolol, is cleared by your kidney and built up in your system when your kidney function worsened).
Please call your doctor or go to the emergency room if your ankle pain worsens, if you feel lightheaded, have chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerning symptoms.
They can check labs and help determine if you need a medication called 'erythropoetin' or 'EPO' for your anemia associated with your kidney dysfunction.
