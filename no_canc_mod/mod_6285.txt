Admission Date:  [**2200-12-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2200-12-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2155-3-12**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 44 year-old [**Country **] Rican female with a history of end stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C on Interferon and Ribavirin with history of recurrent biliary strictures, status post biliary stent, status post biliary ballooning, an ultimately Roux-en-Y procedure [**10-10**] with recent discharge from [**Hospital1 346**] one week ago, now presenting with increasing somnolence and sleepiness at home.
intake with solids and liquids, decreased urina output but still having bowel movement per day per her husband.
There is a questionable history of increase in abdominal distention consistent with ascites.
Also nausea and vomiting for the two days prior to admission.
Patient presents today, brought in by her husband, with lethargy and unable to provide history.
WBCs increased from baseline consistent with a bandemia.
Chest x-ray consistent with worsening pleural effusion, seemed acute and chronic.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) End stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C from blood transfusion.
In [**2199-12-9**] noted increased liver function tests with MRI showing biliary stricture of the anastomosis, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stenting.
In [**2200-11-8**] presented with acute onset of ascites and right upper quadrant pain.
Liver biopsy was positive for active hepatitis C, was treated with Interferon.
The ascites was felt possibly secondary to hepatitis C.  A large right pleural effusion was noted at that time but thoracentesis was performed with negative cultures.
4) History of chronic hepatic hydrothorax.
8) Hepatitis C induced fibrosing cholangitic hepatitis.
9) History of staph aureus positive urinary tract infection treated with Vancomycin.
Dry oral mucosa with crusted secretions.
Cardiovascular:  regular S1 and S2, no murmurs.
Abdomen distended, tense, mild right upper quadrant tenderness.
No rebound or guarding.
Positive abdominal striae with caput medusa.
Extremities 2 to 3+ pitting edema to the knees, no spider angiomata, no pulmonary erythema.
Neurologically no asterixis but difficulty to assess with compliance moving all four extremities.
Urinalysis negative for blood, negative for nitrites, negative for protein, negative for glucose, 0 to 2 RBCs, no white blood cell count, rare bacteria and no squamous epithelium.
Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, low voltage, diffuse T wave flattening, no ST or T wave changes, no Q waves noted.
Chest x-ray:  moderate effusion from the right side compared with [**2200-11-22**].
Linear atelectasis, parenchymal scar in the right upper lobe.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 1005**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2200-12-14**] for ongoing work up and treatment of altered mental status, increasing bilirubinemia, increasing white blood cell count.
Given that the patient was afebrile but had increasing white blood cell count from baseline consistent with bandemia there was concern for acute hepatitis versus SVP versus cholangitis.
At the esophagogastroduodenoscopy procedure they noted varices in the lower third of the esophagus with erythema and abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance in the antrum and stomach compatible with gastropathy.
There was blood in the fundus and the stomach body and food in the body but otherwise normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy to the second par of the duodenum.
In addition, the patient was noted to have 30 cc of coffee ground emesis and guaiac positive emesis this morning this was the reason for the esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
In addition, the CT head examination was performed to rule out other causes of encephalopathy and this was negative.
She continued to have lactulose per rectum with four bowel movements and improvement in her mental status.
An infectious disease consult was obtained and recommended starting Vancomycin to cover for possible urinary tract infection and T tube infections in the past.
The following morning th patient was noted to have decreased urine output with 70 cc an hour with 70 cc noted over the course of the last eight hours.
In addition, she vomited coffee ground emesis after being n.p.o.
At this time the patient's INR was 2.5 and remained elevated despite vitamin K.  Patient had a paracentesis, was doing marginally better until that day when the paracentesis was performed and noted to have frankly bloody ascites.
After the procedure the patient was observed to be nearly comatose due to concerns of altered mental status, airway protection and hemodynamic stability.
Given the results of the paracentesis the feeling was the blood loss was into ascitic fluid rather than gastrointestinal tract or hemolysis.
The cause of bleeding was felt to be possible oozing from the surface of the liver or gastrointestinal tract secondary to portal hypertension.
Doubtfully felt complication of the paracentesis to which was complicated by coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia.
The altered mental status was felt secondary to progressively worsening hepatic encephalopathy in the setting of the intra-abdominal bleed infection.
Patient's renal failure progressed to creatinine of 2.4 and this was felt secondary to decreased intravascular volume versus early hepatorenal syndrome.
Renal team was consulted with consideration of the issue of acute tubular necrosis in the setting of decreased intravascular volume perfusing her kidneys.
The heme team was consulted regarding the coagulopathy and was felt most likely consistent with increased liver disease.
On [**12-19**] the patient was deemed stable with no chest pain, shortness of breath or vomiting and she continued to complain of lethargy.
Creatinine continued to rise worrisome for continued acute tubular necrosis.
End stage liver disease.
Acute tubular necrosis.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed with esophageal varices.
Altered mental status.
Coagulopathy secondary to end stage liver disease.
