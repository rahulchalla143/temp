She also notes LUE pain that starts in the left arm and radiates upward to the heart happens when she is short of breath.
She also does have some chest pain that is exertional.
The patient is unable to perform pulmonary function tests because of her difficulty with performing the test.
An echocardiogram on [**2164-1-25**] revealed severe aortic stenosis with peak transalvular velocity of 4.44 m/sec, peak/mean pressure gradiesnt of 79/45 mmHg, and calculated [**Location (un) 109**] by continuity equation of 0.5-0.6 cm2.
Cardiac catheterization revealed mild-moderate coronary artery disease which will be managed medically.

There is a bidirectional shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
There is mild aortic insufficiency noted at the junction of the native non and right coronary cusps.
1- 2+ mitral regurgitation present.
She initially experienced intermittent hypertension which responded well to Nicardipine drip.
Warfarin was resumed for atrial fibrillation but held after one dose due to supratherapeutic INR.
Over several days, beta blockade and Diltiazem were titrated accordingly with much improved blood pressure and rate control.
However required titration down due to bradycardia.
