# DIASTOLIC CHF DECOMPENSATION: Pt initially appeared clincally hypervolemic with BNP elevated (2,000s) from baseline.
Pt was diuresed with IV lasix which improved SOB and showed improvement on CXR.
EKG with no acute changes.
Calcium Channel blocker was not introduced but would be the next [**Doctor Last Name 360**] to add if pt continues to have A. fib with HR>100s.
# HYPERTENSION: Continued Lisinopril 5mg and increased metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **]-->100mg [**Hospital1 **].
# AF s/p TEE cardioversion: CHADS2 = 3 (High Risk).
Decision was made to change couamdin dose from 3mg daily to 2mg daily since he appeared to have supratherapeutic INR on 3mg.
# DM 2: Held home hypoglycemics and continued insulin Sliding scale.
# GUAIAC-POSITIVE STOOL: One stool was guiaic positive.
No evidence of significant GI bleed.
