LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Severe global LV hypokinesis.
Severely depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Markedly dilated RV cavity.
Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Renal ultrasound [**2194-10-25**]: IMPRESSION: No interval change in appearance of the kidneys in comparison to the exam from one day prior: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 68791**] is a 78 yo M w/heart failure, AF on coumadin, Ao valve replacement, and CKD who presented with SOB, fatigue, anemia and ascites.
He denied hematemesis or hematochesia.
The patient was kept of a PPI during his hospital course for his GI bleed.
Ascites: Mr. [**Known lastname 68791**] presented with an expanding abdomen over a two week period.
Diagnostic tap of the peritoneal fluid was suggestive of cardiac ascites with a serum ascites albumin gradient > 1.1 and total protein > 2.5.
This is likely secondary to his HF and severe TR.
Abd ultrasound showed nodular echotexture of the liver with irregular contour suggestive of cirrhosis.
He presents with increasing SOB and fatigue, but [**Hospital1 **] orthopnea and PND.
Mr. [**Known lastname 68791**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] ever having a heart attack and he had a cardiac cath in [**2181**] that showed clean coronaries.
His dilated cardiomyopathy is presumed to be non-ischemic in nature.
The patient was fluid overloaded on presentation with bilateral crackles up a third of his lung fields and pulmonary edema on CXR.
He was started on Toprol XL 12.5 qd and lisinopril 5mg qd for his heart failure.
The patient did not tolerate a higher dose of beta-blocker as he became bradycardic with asystolic periods as long as 2.45 seconds before being broken by a ventricular escape beat.
Arrhythmia: Patient was in Afib with several runs of non-sustained Vtach.
The patient was started on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID for rate control.
While on metoprolol, he experienced several episodes of asystole lasting as long as 2.45 seconds followed by ventricular escape beats.
His TTE showed 4+ TR and MR likely due to dilation of the heart.
ARF: The patient was in acute renal failure with a Cr of 4.1 at admission.
This was thought to be pre-renal in the setting of his heart failure.
We did not have a baseline Cr, but he has chronic renal failure by history.
Disp:*30 Tablet Sustained Release 24HR(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Congestive heart failure Upper GI bleeding Acute renal failure .
Secondary: -AF on coumadin -AVR -h/o GIB -CKD   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and fluid overload in your abdomen due to heart failure.
You were also found to have a very low hematocrit level due to gastrointestinal bleed.
You were transfused with blood and had a upper GI endoscopy done which showed one bleeding site that was cauterized.
You were diuresed with lasix to remove excess fluid from lungs and abdomen.
Regarding the atrial fibrillation, your coumadin was temporarily held for evaluation of GI bleed and you will need your INR checked by the VNA service regularly to ensure it remains within a therapeutic range.
Blood pressure medications prior to admission were modified due to low heart rate.
Please return to the ED or call your PCP if you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, increase in abdomen size, or lower extremity swelling.
