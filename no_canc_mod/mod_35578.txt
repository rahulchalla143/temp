Squamous and respiratory epithelium with reactive epithelial atypia, necrosis, fibrosis, acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation and granulation tissue.
Small nodule consistent with Actinomycotic granule.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Interval increase in soft tissue material within the left main stem bronchial stent and segmental airways immediately distal to the stent.
Marked interval increase in postobstructive consolidation in the left lower lobe.
Overall increase in multifocal ground-glass opacities, particularly in the right lower lobe, compatible with chronic infection.
Otherwise, stable marked bronchiectasis in the left upper lobe, right middle lobe and lingula.

# SOB / fibrosing mediastinitis: Pt had a flex bronch [**11-25**] that showed severe stenosis of L main stent [**3-12**] granulation tissue.
V/Q scan [**11-26**] showed hypoperfusion and hypoventilation of L lung, CT chest, bronchial washings with commensal resp flora.
Pt was taken back to OR on Fri [**11-29**] for stent removal and further debriding of granulation tissue.
She was breathing and satting well initially, but became acutely tachypneic and tachycardic.
She was also found to have MRSA in her [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the patient was started on Vancomycin on [**2182-12-2**] for a 7 day course.
# Tachycardia: Pulse in 120s on admission, sinus tach with baseline nonspecific ST-T wave changes unchanged from baseline.
On HD 2 she was noted to have frequent extra beats on morning physical exam.
ECG was repeated which showed decreased rate in the 60s with frequent PACs of unclear etiology.
#PNA: She has a history of spiking a fever post procedures similar to this one.
Pt had a fever post procedure.
Levaquin was changed to Cefepime on [**2182-12-1**] for concern for worsening fevers.
#Pulmonary edema: There was a question of pulmonary edema at admission.
CXRs did not show any convincing evidence, with hilar opacities perhaps related to fibrosing mediastinitis.
An echocardiogram showed EF >60%, preserved global systolic function and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Normal coags, platelets and had scant hemoptysis post procedure.
Considered likely [**3-12**] chronic disease.
Combivent 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: fibrosing mediastinitis MRSA post-obstructive pneumonia anemia   Discharge Condition: Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).
You also had bacteria found in your lungs, and it was treated with antibiotics.
