The patient tolerated the procedure well, and was subsequently taken to the Intensive Care Unit, where an attempt for extubation failed secondary to increased agitation, at which time he had to be sedated and switched to SIMV with pressure support.
On postoperative day two, the patient converted to atrial fibrillation with first degree AV block, and was placed on amiodarone drip as will as a nitrite drip.
The Psychiatry team also agreed with administration of Haldol and doses of benzodiazepine to decrease any possibility of alcohol withdrawal which, at that point, was unlikely.
The patient was discharged to rehabilitation for further monitoring, as there is no metabolic reason for his mental status change.
