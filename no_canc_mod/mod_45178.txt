Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname 4377**]                     Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 6771**]  Admission Date:  [**2188-1-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2188-2-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2143-2-4**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital1 1098**]/  DISCHARGE SUMMARY ADDENDUM:  LABORATORY DATA: CBC significant for WBC falling to 10.2 gradually on [**2188-2-3**].
Chest x-ray on [**2188-1-29**]  - Large area of predominately air space opacity in the right lung consistent with pneumonia / aspiration.
CT scan of head on [**2188-1-27**] - Focal low density in the posterior left frontal lobe subcortical region which could represent a small focal infarct, inflammatory lesion or brain abscess.
MRI of head on [**2188-1-29**] - Inappropriate prominence of sulci and ventricles, a well defined area of T1 and flair hypointensity and T1 hyperintensity seen adjacent to a sulcus in the left frontal lobe which is unchanged from previus study.
MRI with gadolinium on [**2188-2-4**] - A well defined area of T1 and flair hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity seen adjacent to a sulcus in the left posterior frontal lobe which is unchanged.
IMPRESSION:  Discreet lesion in the left posterior frontal lobe, low on T1 and high on T2 consistent with a cystic area without enhancement representing possibly the residue of an inflammatory process, ischemic process or developmental abnormality.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Impression and plan for a 44 year-old woman with extensive psychiatric history and history of lithium use brought to the Emergency Department because of unresponsiveness and because she was found to have a sodium of 118.
Toxic ingestion was considered as a cause of her mental state, however her tox screen was positive only for benzodiazepines.
The patient was noted to have extremely copious urine output on [**2188-1-27**] in 3550 out 2660.
Based upon the patient's dilute urine and her copious urine output and her lack of responsiveness to DDAVP, she in all likelihood has nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
Therefore she is unable to concentrate her urine and she is required to take in a large amount of fluids by mouth.
After the patient's mental status had cleared she in fact reported a history of constantly being thirsty at home.
The patient was becoming hypernatremic to 150 to 151 while fluid restricted and continuing to produce copious urine at this time also suggests diabetes insipidus.
It was felt that the patient's hyponatremia on admission was probably due to psychogenic polydipsia.
Because of the patient's nephrogenic diabetes insipidus she is at risk for hypernatremia because of her constant water loss.
She did have an elevated high blood cell count which could be due either to infection or to stress such as her likely seizure.
She did not complain of any cough or any fever subsequently.
Based on her chest x-ray it is possible that she may have had an aspiration pneumonia at the time of her initial event.
NEUROLOGIC - The patient's likely seizure was probably due to a setting of hyponatremia as well as her fever.
The patient was evaluated by the Neurology service and a head MRI was performed to rule out pituitary mass as the cause of her diabetes insipidus.
MRI findings as described above showed a lesion that appeared to be old and did not appear to be a mass.
Given that the seizure occurred in the setting of hyponatremia and fever, it was decided not to discharge her on an anti-seizure medication.
The Psychiatry service also noted that her psychiatric history is significant for limited intelligence, bipolar disorder and schizoaffective / borderline disorder.
They felt that she does appear depressed but it does not appear that her unconsciousness was a result of a suicide attempt nor is she currently suicidal.
On the day of discharge the patient was comfortable, was ambulating, eating and drinking without any problems and was mentally appropriate.
Hyponatremia - likely due to psychogenic polydipsia.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus - probably due to lithium toxicity.
History of depression and bipolar disorder.
The [**Hospital **] Clinic at the [**Hospital 616**] Clinic on [**2188-2-15**] at three P.M. where she will see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of her diabetes.
