Admission Date: [**2198-11-17**]        Discharge Date: [**2198-11-26**]   Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old female nursing home resident with Parkinson's disease who was found down at the nursing home with blood around her forehead area, was brought by Emergency Medical Services in a hemodynamically stable condition to the emergency room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for Parkinson's disease as stated above, degenerative joint disease, narcolepsy, hypercholesterolemia, cataract surgery.
Her rectal examination noted her to have good tone, no masses felt.
She had good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  At this time 81-year-old woman was admitted status post fall with a right forehead laceration that was sutured in the emergency room and studies were performed Head CAT scan revealed a temporal/sub-arachnoid bleed and likely brain contusion.
Showed chronic sinusitis and some motion artifact.
CAT scan of her spine showed anterior displacement of C3/4 questionable whether this was an old result or new one.
Extensive degenerative changes were also noted in her cervical spine and anterior effusion of C5 and C6 was also noted.
Her lumbosacral spine noted chronic changes and loss of height at L1 without obvious fracture.
Her chest x-ray done at an outside hospital and here showed no pneumothorax.
The patient received chest x-ray and Pelvic films that were negative for fracture and it was at this time questionable in terms of the etiology of this fall and that was pursued as well.
The patient was seen by Neurosurgery at this time who noted the patient to be minimally compliant with the exam without focal deficits and to be moving well.
On hospital day two, the patient received another head CAT scan that was noted to be stable and it was noted that the MRI was unable to be read due to poor quality.
The patient at this time was also seen by Neurology for decrease in mental status after this fall and advised on her Parkinson's medication doses.
She had not yet regained her baseline mental status at this point, was predominantly nonverbal and rarely interactive and non cooperative following a few commands.
A TSH was checked which came back normal at 0.41, in light of an enlarged thyroid seen on CAT scan of the neck.
The patient was also given a swallowing evaluation and they suggested for us to maintain her NPO with nasogastric tube feedings at this time for safety reasons and that she was not ready to engage in the act of eating and drinking.
The patient was also seen by Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy throughout her stay who worked on increasing her mobility and her ability to perform daily tasks though she was still minimally interactive and on [**2198-11-23**] the patient was brought to the operating room and received percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement for purpose of feedings.
The patient had received shoulder x- rays and CAT scans of the right shoulder which showed soft tissue swelling and no obvious fracture.
Orthopedics determined this was likely bursitis and for pain control and for her to be treated conservatively at this point.
There were no other active issues at this time and the patient was to be discharged to rehabilitation facility.
The doctor is to be made aware of having worsening pains, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, dizziness or if there were any questions or concerns.
The patient is to follow-up with Neurology in two weeks and to have flexion and extension films of her neck and to call to schedule an appointment at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 44**] and for cervical collar to be possibly removed at this time.
