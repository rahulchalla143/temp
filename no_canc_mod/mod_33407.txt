The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
He was known to have type I  second degree AV block and was trialed on low dose betablockers for their protective effect.
He developed progressive heart block (type I mobitz AV block)and betablockers were discontinued after consultation with electrophysiology service.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD#5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
