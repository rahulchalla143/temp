Admission Date:  [**2105-9-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-10-21**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain and distention  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2105-9-17**]: Lysis of adhesions, small-bowel resection.
[**2105-10-5**]: Right cephalic PICC.
History of Present Illness: 88 M history of colon cancer s/p colectomy and end colostomy ~20 years ago presents with 1 day history of abdominal pain and distention.
He reports having gradual onset abdominal pain which started this morning.
He has had minimal output from his ostomy for "a few days".
He presented to [**Hospital3 **] and a CT abdomen performed demonstrated a partial small bowel obstruction in the mid-abdomen.
He denies any history of obstructions or similar symptoms.
Past Medical History: PMH: history of colon cancer s/p open colectomy and end colostomy ~20 years ago  PSH: colectomy with end colostomy ~20 years ago, knee replacement, shoulder surgery (rotator cuff)   Social History: Lives with wife [**Name (NI) **] tobacco No ETOH  Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: VS: 98.0 94 150/96 16 96% RA Gen: NAD, AOx3 CVS: reg Pulm: no resp distress Abd: Softly distended  TTP throughout, mainly epigastric region LE: no CCE  Pertinent Results: [**2105-9-11**] 01:20AM   WBC-10.8 RBC-4.74 HGB-14.9 HCT-43.4 MCV-92 MCH-31.5 MCHC-34.4 RDW-13.1 [**2105-9-11**] 01:20AM   NEUTS-90.2* LYMPHS-6.0* MONOS-3.6 EOS-0.2 BASOS-0.2 [**2105-9-11**] 01:20AM   PLT COUNT-194 [**2105-9-11**] 01:20AM   GLUCOSE-142* UREA N-17 CREAT-1.0 SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-4.7 CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-27 ANION GAP-17  [**2105-9-11**] KUB showed: 1.
Dilated small bowel loops containing residual oral contrast and air-fluid levels, which in the right clinical circumstances could be reflective of small-bowel obstruction.
Residual contrast filling the right collecting system suggestive of partial or full obstruction of the renal right collecting system.
There is still mild dilatation of small bowel loops containing some residual oral contrast from a previous CT scan and demonstrating air-fluid levels on the decubitus view.
In the appropriate clinical setting, these findings could be consistent with small bowel obstruction.
[**2105-9-16**] KUB showed: There are several air-filled minimally dilated loops of small bowel seen particularly in the right abdomen.
This has the appearance of persistent small bowel obstruction.
New ground glass opacities and small foci of consolidation, most severe in the right upper lobe, is concerning for evolving aspiration pneumonia given large hiatal hernia and recent history of emesis.
Differential diagnosis does includes asymmetric pulmonary edema if the patient has underlying mitral valvular disease.
Mild anasarca and mild fluid overload with minimal interlobular smooth septal thickening.
Small amount of pneumoperitoneum consistent with recent exploratory laparotomy.
Small bilateral effusions with associated atelectasis.
Mild cardiomegaly.
[**2105-9-27**] CXR showed: Consolidation in the right lung has spread from the juxtahilar right upper lobe to much of the right lower lung, accompanied by increasing moderate right pleural effusion.
Left lower lobe atelectasis persists.
Heart size is enlarged but difficult to assess because of adjacent pleural and parenchymal abnormalities.
No pneumothorax.
Residual oral contrast is seen within the colon to the rectum without evidence of distention.
This reflects a prolonged transit time, but no evidence of obstruction.
Air-filled loops of small bowel without evidence of obstruction, improved compared to the prior.
[**2105-10-5**] Video swallow showed: Frank aspiration with appropriate cough response with nectar consistency.
Acute pulmonary embolism involving a right upper lobe apical segmental branch.
New left upper lobe airspace consolidation and worsening right upper lobe airspace consolidation that is concerning for multifocal spread of infection.
Superimposed mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Stable prominent mediastinal lymph nodes and left hilar lymph nodes, likely reactive in nature.
Several foci of intraperitoneal free air, newly apparent since post-surgical CT from [**2105-9-24**].
Calcified pleural plaques indicative of prior asbestos exposure.
Although no definite evidence for perforation is present, it is not excluded.
The locules of air may represent residual air from abdominal surgery, although this surgery occurred several weeks prior, which would be unusual.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
Nasogastric tube looped on itself within a hiatal hernia with the tip extending superiorly into the esophagus.
Parastomal hernia but no bowel obstruction.
Pleural plaques.
[**2105-10-16**] CT head showed: No acute large vascular territory infarct, shift of midline structures or mass effect is present.
There is diffuse bihemispheric left greater than right periventricular and subcortical white matter hypoattenuation, consistent with small vessel ischemic disease.
There is calcific atherosclerosis of the vertebral arteries and both carotid arteries.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the ACS service in the Emergency Room and admitted to the hospital for conservative treatment of his partial small bowel obstruction with IV hydration, gastric decompression with a nasogastric tube and serial exams.
He was seen by the Urology service initially as he had a ureteral stone noted incidentally on his Abd CT that was done at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
He had no pain and no elevation of his creatinine therefore this incidental finding would be worked up if it did not pass on its own.
He did have some low urine output which responded to IV fluids but that was secondary to low intravascular volume as opposed to renal failure from an obstructing stone.
His NG tube was replaced due to persistent vomiting and eventually his abdomen was soft however his ostomy was not active.
After waiting 6 days for resolution he was taken to the Operating Room on [**2105-9-17**] for an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions and a small bowel resection.
His pain was controlled with a PCA.
By post op day #5 he developed anasarca and was treated with IV Lasix and 25% Albumin.
He continued to have minimal output and air from his ostomy.
On post op day #7 he developed a fever of 101.6 and emesis.
A nasogastric tube was replaced and he had a Ct scan of the chest and abdomen revealing a new right upper lobe pneumonia.
His initial chest xray revealed a right upper lobe infiltrate but over time he devaloped multilobar infiltrates with a component of fluid volume overload.
He had his ostomy digitalized and eventually had an enema which helped to increase output.
Unfortunately he became tachypneic, desaturated and was tachycardic to 120 BPM one day later and he also had a temp spike to 101.6.
His chest xray showed the same multilobar infiltrates along with bilateral effusions and fluid overload.
After his bowel function returned he was evaluated on multiple occasions by the Speech and Swallow service as he was deconditioned and had some episodes of aspiration.
He eventually was able to take ground solids and nectar thick liquids without aspirating.
On [**2105-10-4**], he was transfused 2 u PRBC for acute post-op anemia with hct of 21.9.
He became febrile on [**2105-10-4**], and all antibiotics were stopped and PICC was pulled with tip sent for culture.
Blood cultures and line tip culture up to [**2105-10-4**] ultimately showed no growth.
On [**2105-10-9**], CTA chest was obtained for poor respirations, finding acute pulmonary embolism, and the patient was started on a heparin gtt.
On [**2105-10-10**], the patient suffered respiratory decompensation and was transferred to the ICU.
BAL cultures showed MRSA and yeast.
Pleural effusion was drained for 900 mL and grew bacteroides fragilis.
The fluid grew MRSA and bacteroides fragilis.
On serial CXR, the pneumonia and pleural effusion progressively improved.
Due to aspiration risk, on [**2105-10-14**], a G-J tube was placed by IR.
On [**2105-10-15**], due to failure to wean off mechanical ventilation, the patient underwent bedside tracheostomy.
He was receiving vancomycin (most recent course started on [**2105-10-9**]) and meropenem (most recent course started on [**2105-10-10**]) for pneumonia and peri-hepatic abscess.
4. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every four (4) hours as needed for fever or pain.

*Your pain worsens or changes location.
*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
Incision Care: *Please call your surgeon or go to the emergency department if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower and wash incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
G-J tube Care: *Please look at the drain site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warmth, and fever).
*Attach the tube securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
What you should contact your healthcare provider [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Signs of a life-threatening reaction.
These include wheezing; chest tightness; fever; itching; bad cough; blue skin color; fits; or swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, severe dizziness or passing out, falls or accidents, especially if you hit your head.
Talk with healthcare provider even if you feel fine, significant change in thinking clearly and logically, severe headache, severe back pain, severe belly pain, black, tarry, or bloody stools, blood in the urine, nosebleeds, coughing up blood, vomiting blood, unusual bruising or bleeding, severe menstrual bleedin, or rash.
Also call if you have stomach problems, vomiting, or diarrhea that lasts more than 1 day.
However, recent research shows that rather than eliminating vitamin K from your diet, it is more important to be consistent in your dietary vitamin K intake.
If your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for bleeding problems.
If it is too low, you might be at risk for forming clots.
It is very important to talk with your doctor about all of the other medicines that you are taking, including over-the-counter medicines, antibiotics, vitamins, or herbal products.
