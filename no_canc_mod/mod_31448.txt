No JVD although difficult with body habitus.
CV: RRR no m/r/g appreciated Lungs: moving some air but not much.
No crackles or rhonchi.
Limited evaluation due to low lung volumes.
Probable mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Bibasilar patchy opacities likely representing atelectasis; however, developing infection cannot be excluded.
Unchanged deformity of the left chest wall and thoracic scoliosis.
Pulmonary edema improved.
Left basilar opacity cleared.
Right pleural effusion decreased, now small with adjacent minimal basilar atelectasis.
Chest wall deformity and scoliosis are unchanged.
CXR ([**10-8**]): Moderate right pleural effusion and pulmonary vascular congestion, borderline cardiomegaly and mediastinal venous engorgement all worsened since [**10-7**] after showing previous improvement.
Mediastinal contour raises possibility of pulmonary hypertension.
No pneumothorax.
Rib asymmetry is difficult to explain but there could be a supernumerary first or second rib on the left.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

However, he has no prior dx of heart failure, BNP was minimally elevated and echo was not consistent with acute heart failure.
