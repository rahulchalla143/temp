The liver is mildly diffusely echogenic, without focal liver lesion or intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
There is no ascites.
IMPRESSION: Mild diffusely echogenic liver, without intrahepatic ductal dilatation, focal lesion or ascites.
The mild increased echogenicity of the liver may represent fatty inflitration; however, in this young patient with Tylenol overdose, etiologies such as drug- induced hepatitis or NASH cannot be excluded on this study.
The patient was infused from 10:30 am to 2:45 pm, at which time the infusion was halted due an erythematous rash over the chest.
She was judged by the hepatology service to no longer be at risk for hepatotoxicity, and the NAC infusion was stopped.
Psychiatry felt she has some generalized anxiety NOS and could not rule out major depressive disorder.
However, the psychiatry consultation judged that she would be safe to discharge home, and that this she was not at risk for further suicide attempts.
If you have any abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, please come back to the hospital.
