This is an interim summary of the patient's progress while on the Trauma Surgery Service.
Reportedly fell down from a [**Location (un) 10043**] height with a questionable loss of consciousness.
He was evaluated at an outside hospital and he was found to have bilateral wrist fractures, a right superior and inferior pubic ramus fracture, a L1 compression fracture.
ALLERGIES:  The patient was later discovered to have allergies to Heparin.
PHYSICAL EXAM UPON PRESENTATION TO THE TRAUMA CENTER: Patient was awake and alert, but in mild distress.
HEENT examination showed his tympanic membranes to be clear bilaterally.
There was no jugular venous distention noted.
His chest examination showed a stable chest without any external trauma.
His heart was a regular, rate, and rhythm without any murmurs.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended and active bowel sounds were heard.
Extremities:  There were deformities of the bilateral wrists noted on both upper extremities.
His back examination showed no stepoffs, but positive lumbar tenderness.
There was no hemothorax.
There was no pneumothorax.
There was a question of a L1 fracture.
His pelvic x-ray showed a superior and inferior right pubic rami fracture.
He was positive for cocaine, opiates, and benzodiazepines.
Studies that were obtained at [**Hospital1 **] on the day of admission included a CT scan of the head which was negative for any acute injury.
A CT scan of the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral areas show a L1 burst fracture with question of a posterior wedge fracture.
CT scan of abdomen and pelvis showed fatty liver with diverticula were noted.
There was no free fluid noted in the abdomen.
Right and left wrist x-rays on both upper extremities showed distal radius fractures in both wrists.
As mentioned, Orthopedic Surgery was consulted for his pelvic fractures as well as his bilateral wrist fractures.
The patient's left distal radius fracture was reduced under conscious sedation and films were obtained.
Patient's right iliac fracture extended into the acetabulum.
He also had right sacral fractures and a right superoinferior pubic ramus fracture as previously mentioned.
He was placed on logroll precautions because of these fractures.
Patient was taken to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2135-8-1**] for an open reduction internal fixation of his right distal radius fracture.
Patient's left distal radius fracture after splinting and reduction films showed good alignment, however, the right distal radius fracture was taken to the operating room for open reduction internal fixation.
The patient did receive 2 units of packed red blood cells perioperatively for some anemia that was occurring.
Also during his hospital course, on approximately [**2135-8-5**], patient began having increasing abdominal pain, distention in his right lower quadrant.
With re-examination, it was determined the patient had severe right lower quadrant guarding as well as peritoneal signs suggestive of a perforation viscus and subsequent peritonitis.
The patient underwent also a right hemicolectomy for a perforated right colon.
He was given Pepcid for DVT prophylaxis as well as Venodyne leg stockings for DVT prophylaxis.
Postoperatively, the next several days the patient continued to have a tachycardia.
The patient continued to have good urine output and a patient's history of alcoholism suggested DT's etiology, and the patient was treated with Ativan for his agitation and tachycardia.
He did remain hemodynamically stable besides the tachycardia which was in the 130s to 140s.
The suspicion of a possible pulmonary embolism led to the order of a chest CT angiogram, which did show a positive left lower lobe pulmonary artery thrombus.
The patient's history of having Heparin-induced antibody positive did not allow him to be Heparinized, and therefore a Hematology consultation was obtained to aide in anticoagulation for the patient's pulmonary embolism.
The patient was started on Hirudin drip to continue his anticoagulation for the pulmonary embolism per Hematology.
He remained on Hirudin as well per Hematology to continue his anticoagulation for his pulmonary embolism.
He was kept on nasogastric tube suction which drained quite a bit of bilious fluid from his stomach.
His abdomen became less and less distended, and returned to a normal soft abdomen with active bowel sounds.
Orthopedic Surgery requested repeat films of his bilateral upper extremities at this time, this was approximately [**8-25**].
The Orthopedic Surgery team then determined that patient would require surgery on approximately [**9-1**], and that would be an open reduction internal fixation of his left wrist because the left wrist films showed a loss of length and increased dorsal angulation, which would require surgery.
At this time, the patient's Coumadin was stopped, and his Hirudin was continued to keep him anticoagulated for treatment of his pulmonary embolism.
It was then requested by pharmacy that the Hirudin be discontinued due to the risk of possible anaphylactic reaction to the ongoing use of Hirudin, and the patient was then started on Argatroban for continuation of his anticoagulation needs.
He was then transferred to the Orthopedic Surgery team for further hospital care leading up into his open reduction internal fixation of his left distal radius fracture.
