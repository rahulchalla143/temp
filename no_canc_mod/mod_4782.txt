History of Present Illness: Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 23227**] is a 74 yoF with a history of HTN and & hypothyroidism, who presented to the ED this morning with rigors.
On [**2-28**] she was seen at [**Company 191**] for removal of the stitches and was noted to have some drainage from the wound; she was switched to Bactrim DS 1 tab [**Hospital1 **].
Labs were notable for a leukocytosis of 12,000, a lactate of 3.3, and an elevated BUN to 27.
She was transferred to the MICU briefly for observation with borderline BP and elevated lactate.
On arrival, she was c/o her chronic back and neck pain as well as nausea.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hypothyroidism Osteoarthritis Chronic back pain Peripheral neuropathy  Social History: The patient lives independently in [**Location (un) 38**], with no home care needs.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
SKIN: Right lower extremity (tibia) with 2cm escar, and ~5-6cm of surrounding erythema (marked by pen).
No edema, or purulent drainage after attempts to express; recent suture removal.
Chest PA and LAT ([**3-3**]): Since [**2169-2-9**], bibasilar opacities increased, likely atelectasis, very less likely bibasilar pneumonia.
Bilateral upper lobe opacities are likely artifactual, due to a different technique.
There is no pleural effusion.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No significant valvular abnormalities.
No vegetations identified.
Right Leg MRI ([**3-5**]): (dictated report) No evidence of osteomyelitis or soft tissue abscess.
No left or right lower extremity DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: A 74 year-old woman presenting with clear signs of a systemic infection, including fevers, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and elevated lactate.
At admission, she had significant pain and erythema at the site of the right leg laceration.
Her systemic symptoms were felt to be due to inflammatory response from the cellulitis.
The area of cellulitis had also decreased substantially in size.
She continued to have intermittent episodes of chills, with fevers up to 101, on the vancomycin.
This showed normal ejection fraction with no valvular vegetations.
She underwent right leg MRI which showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
Liver enzymes were checked for concern of alcalculous cholecystitis; these were mildly elevated but consistent with her baseline transaminitis, likely from NAFLD.
After five days of vancomycin, with no positive culture data, we switched her to oral Linezolid to complete a fourteen day course.
At time of discharge, she has not had fevers in over 24 hours.
She had a markedly elevated CRP (222) during this admission, and it is felt her fevers and chills are due to a prolonged inflammatory response to the cellulitis.
Symptomatically she feels improved, and her cellulitis is resolving.
Her atenolol-chlorthalidone was held at admission due to hypotension in the setting of possible sepsis.
Once stable on the floors, her antihypertensive was restarted without complication.
Chronic Pain/neuropathy.
Gastrointestinal reflux disease.
Chronic bronchitis.
Subcutaneous heparin, then pneumoboots, were used for venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Right leg cellulitis .
Secondary Diagnoses Hypertension Hypothyroidism Osteoarthritis Chronic back pain Peripheral neuropathy   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable.
We treated the infection with intravenous vancomycin.
During the admission, we were trying to localize a source for infection that could explain the fevers.
We took images of the heart that did not show evidence of valvular infection.
We did an MRI of the right leg that did not show evidence of bone infection.
We did ultrasounds of the legs that did not show any venous clots.
We believe that the chills and fevers are likely due to cellulitis, and the cellulitis has improved significantly on antibiotics.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have fever or other symptoms that are concerning to you.
Please follow-up in primary care clinic on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**3-10**] with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3817**] to have your wound checked.
