2) End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
3) Sternal wound.
5) Respiratory distress.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old female, status post a long hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] culminating in CABG x 4, porcine AVR, aspiration, infection, sternal wound infection, saphenous vein site infection, status post a G-tube with abdominal wall necrosis, status post J-tube, ARF requiring hemodialysis.
Then readmitted on [**2195-6-6**] for fever to 103.
In VICU for sternal wound infection and transferred to [**Hospital **] Rehab.
At [**Hospital1 **], two days prior to admission per report, the patient had a PEA arrest, status post epinephrine.
Chest x-ray and CT showed a bilateral lower lobe consolidation and left upper lobe consolidation.
The [**Year (4 digits) **] report from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital attributed mucous plugging and vent associated pneumonia leading to PEA arrest.
Also contributing were elements of hyperkalemia, hypoxia and hypovolemia.
The patient had initially had episodes of SVT in the 70s-90s which responded to 250 of normal saline.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation and spontaneously converted to sinus.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Coronary artery disease, status post CABG x 4 - LIMA to LAD, SVG to diagonal, SVG to OM sequential, 2) AVR, porcine, 3) End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, 4) Diabetes, 5) OSA, 6) OA, 7) Vertigo, 8) Skin cancer, 9) History of abdominal hernia repair, 10) Uterine cancer, status post TAH, 11) Obesity, 12) Hypertension, 13) Status post esophageal dilatation, 14) Status post gastric bypass with ventral hernia, 15) High cholesterol.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General - an elderly woman, chronically ill, in no acute distress.
OP - mucous membranes moist, evidence of some EOMI.
Neck - trach, no JVD.
Lungs - crackles at the left lower zone.
Evidence of sternal wound draining, suctioned with VAC.
Evidence of a J-tube entrance of a ventral hernia wound and evidence of a wound under the left breast.
No decreased deep tendon reflexes in lower extremities.
CT of the chest showed left upper lobe infiltrate, bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral consolidation.
Outside hospital [**Hospital1 8**] report head CT - chronic degenerative changes.
On [**6-29**] chest CT report - no PE, bilateral lower lobe consolidation, effusions, left upper lobe consolidation.
Echo from [**6-8**] - LVEF of greater than 55%, RV function reduced, mild MR.  ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient was a 75-year-old woman with coronary artery disease, CABG, end-stage renal disease, diabetes, status post a PEA arrest, V-fib, A-fib, now in sinus, likely secondary to hypoxia, hyperkalemia.
The arrest was likely a combination of hypoxia and mucous plugging, as well as metabolic with possible hyperkalemia and hypercalcemia.
Patient treated with vanc, tobra, ceftaz and Flagyl, given history of vent-associated, given history of antibiotic resistant organisms.
Sputum showed gram-negative rods.
3) RENAL:  Patient with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
4) ENDOCRINE:  Patient with diabetes on sliding scale.
The patient had no evidence of active pus or drainage from any of the sites.
6) NEURO:  Patient evaluated by neuro in-house given change in mental status, status post PEA arrest.
The patient's initial diagnosis was most likely hypoxic damage resulting from hypoxic event.
The patient's head CT showed no changes.
Lines - patient with left Quinton, right subclavian peripherals.
2) End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
