Admission Date:  [**2124-9-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-9-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4588**] Chief Complaint: Dark stools x3 days, lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation arterial line placement femoral line placement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yoM with PMH significant for CHF, CAD, HTN, DM, mild dementia, CVA, PE on coumadin, and s/p L hip repair on [**2124-8-13**], who was was found to be semi-repsonsive at home on [**2124-9-11**].
While patient was walking to the bathroom, pt felt weak and became acutely less responsive.
He was lethargic but reponded appropriately to questions, denying CP/SOB.
His rectal exam showed red blood, but no frank hemorrhage.
His EKG was significant for new ST depressions in V2-V6.
Given his ST depressions in V2-V6, cards was called, and recommended continuing plavix and coumadin (therapeutic), but no asa due to allergy (anaphylaxis).
Upon immediate arrival to MICU, while being turned by nursing, the patient was noted to be agonally breathing and became asystolic on the monitor.
His cardiac arrest was thought to be likly due to demand ischemia from GI bleed which triggered myocardial infarction and potentially cardiac arrest.
His GI bleed ceased and Hct stabilized at 31.4 post total 5 units of tranfusion and fluid resuscitation.
He had acute on chronic renal failture at Cr of 3.2 from 2.7, now at 3.4.
GI was consulted and considered EGD but decided to do as an elective EGD prior to D/C if pt re-bleeds since no further episodes of GI bleed occured and Hct stabilized.

No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: equal BS bilaterally, mild bilateral rales.

SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2124-9-16**] Cresentic thrombus within the left popliteal vein which is only partially occlusive and is most consistent with chronic DVT with  recanalization.
No evidence of acute DVT within the lower extremities.
Echo [**2124-9-11**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with global hypokinesis and inferior, septal and apical akinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
There are Q waves in the inferior leads consistent with prior myocardial infarction.
There are tiny R waves in the anterior leads consistent with probable prior anterior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no significant change   Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is s/p cardiac arrest and resuscitation.
# CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most likely due to demand from GI bleeding.
Trop-T was elevated in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive, again likely due to demand ischemia.
This could have triggered myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest.
Pt was monitored on tele with no acute episode of cardiac symptoms or any signs of cardiogenic shock.
no ASA given- allergy.
It is important to closly monitor his Hct given h/o acute blood loss and resulted in cardiac arrest.
# GI bleed: Gi followed patient and decided not to perform endoscopy/colonoscopy due to recent cardiac arrest and per patient/family request.
No further signs of bleeding noted.
It is important that his HCT closly monitored for potential recurrent blood loss.
Plavix was held for risk of bleeding and pt need to discuss with his cardiologist for when to restart Plavix.
# Respiratory Failure is setting of cardiac arrest.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35%-->20% post Cardiac arrest.
# Acute on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) 216**].
His Cr stablized to his baseline 3.2->3.7->2.6 with volume resuscitation.
# DM - last A1c was 6.1%.
# Delirium: we held his venlafaxine and Donepezil due to acute delirium but not resolved.
pain controlled and no acute issue noted .
# FEN-cariac and diabetic healthy diet .
# PPx- on PO PPI, BR standing, hep IV, pboots .
Congestive heart failure 4.
Diabetes Mellitus 2 5.
Coronary artery disease 6. history of myocardial infarction status post Coronary artery bypass graft 7.
Atrial fibrillation 8.
Hypertension 9.
Hypercholesteremia .
Peripheral neuropathy 2. depression 3. dementia   Discharge Condition: stable, no evidence of blood loss   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with weakness and dark stool x 3 days which suggested gastrointestinal bleed.
You experienced cardiac arrest in Medical intensive care unit and you were resuscitated with CPR and medications.
Once your condition was stable (no evidence of bleeding) you were again restarted on heparin and coumadin, your blood levels remained stable and there was no evidence of bleeding.
It was necessary to restart these medications as you are at risk for a stroke due to atrial fibrillation and you have a chronic lower leg vein blood clot.
we strongly recommend your Hematocrit to be closely monitored since you experienced cardiac arrest secondary to acute blood loss.
If you feel weakness or further dark stool, it is important that you call your primary care or come to Emergency room.
