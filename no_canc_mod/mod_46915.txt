There was a brachial vein thrombus present which prompted a consult from the Vascular Surgery service with the question of the need for anticoagulation.
Upon review they felt that due to the patient's high fall risk it would be more prudent to monitor him closely as opposed to full anticoagulation.
His pain resolved and he had no edema or tenderness.
