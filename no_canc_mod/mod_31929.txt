Cath lab findings included no coronary artery disease, cardiac index of 2.0 and a LVEDP and wedge of 25.
Additionally echocardiogram showed diastolic dysfunction and biventricular systolic dysfunction.
While in the cardiac cath lab, the patient was hypoxic with elevated airway pressures.
Family reports that the patient did not have chest pain.
Family states that she was dx with asthma 1 month ago, no prior hx.
States the cold air caused SOB in the garage with tightness of her chest.
In the ED, initial vitals were not recorded  Past Medical History: asthma gastric bypass sugery bowel obstuctions in past per family morbid obesity hypertension  Social History: Never smoked, divorced.
Son has severe epilepsy.
Partner is [**Name2 (NI) 81751**] pt wants to have info shared with her in addition to family  Family History: No family history of early MI, otherwise non-contributory.
Physical Exam: On admission-  BP- 127/63, HR- 69, RR-18, 98% on ventilator at FIO2 of 50%, CMV/assist, VT of 600, Resp set at 14, PEEP 5 Eyes: (Conjunctiva and lids: WNL) Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: (Oral mucosa: WNL), (Teeth, gums and palette: intubated) Neck:  (Jugular veins: Not visible) Back / Musculoskeletal: (Chest wall structure: large area of ecchymoses on chest wall, tenderness parasternally Respiratory:  (Auscultation: WNL Cardiac: (Rhythm: Regular), (Palpation / PMI: WNL), (Auscultation: S1: WNL) Femoral Artery: (Right femoral artery: No bruit), (Left femoral artery: No bruit), left femoral artery with venous catheter and arterial sheath, small amount of bleeding around the area without significant hematoma Ext: no edema, DP 2+ bilaterally, cool extremities, hematoma of the right antecubital fossa.
CARDIOLOGY: Admission echo There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular global systolic dysfunction.
Right ventricular hypertrophy with normal function.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**2-7**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Aortic stenosis is now identified.
Is there a history to suggest a primary aortic (e.g, dissection) or aortic valve pathology (e.g., endocarditis .
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
The RCA had 30% stenosis at the proximal segment and 40-50% stenosis at the origin of the PDA.
There was no evidence of acute thrombosis.
Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacification.
Differential considerations include pulmonary edema, multifocal pneumonia, or other etiologies such as pulmonary hemorrhage or ARDS.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Small right inguinal hematoma near insertion of central venous catheter.
The catheter closely approaches and indents the wall of the common femoral artery adjacent to its course into the common femoral vein, likely simply due to proximity, but reassessment with ultrasound is recommended after catheter removal or if hematoma appears to be enlarging clinically.
4 mm subpleural right middle lobe pulmonary nodule requires no further workup if there is no history of malignancy or significant risk factors for malignancy (i.e., smoking).
KUB FINDINGS: There are air-filled loops of colon, without ileus or obstruction.
There is no massive free air.
There is degenerative change in the lumbar spine.
CXR after extubation IMPRESSION: Overall, interval improvement of congestion of congestive heart failure with persistent mild congestion.
No pneumothorax or pneumonia.
Doppler of LEs [**2149-2-21**]-  IMPRESSION: Limited study, no evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity   Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 61F with obesity (s/p gastric bypass surgery) and asthma, who was admitted s/p PEA arrest.
# PEA arrest: The cause was unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) 227**] LBBB on EKG (and no prior for comparison), the patient went to the cardiac cath lab, where she was found to have no obstructive lesions but elevated LVEDP/PCWP.
# Hypoxia/ Pulmonary: The patient had a recent diagnosis of adult-onset asthma one month and was intubated during the arrest.
She was promptly extubated the day after admission, without difficulty.
# Pump: Initial echo during the cath showed significant cardiac dysfunction with EF of 20%, elevated PCWP.
Repeat study showed EF 55% but new aortic insufficiency not visualized on the first study.
Thus, CT with contrast was done to evaluate for the possibility of aortic dissection.
CT showed no dissection.
# Leukocytosis: likely secondary to steroids and pneumonia in the setting of acute stress.
# HCT drop: mild decrease.
Likely secondary to blood loss during the procedure and multiple hematomas in the chest wall from CPR.
However, had a CT to rule out an RP bleed.
Also had hematoma on right arm from ER placed line, that appeared to have been into the brachial artery.
Hematoma in arm was stable.
# Rib fractures: seen on CT, likely from CPR.
Caused severe pain with movement and respirations.
Pt had pain consult.
# Impaired fasting glucose: several elevated fasting glucose levels, however, was in setting of acute illness.
Pt is at risk for diabetes due to morbid obesity.
Pt was offered and refused to go to rehab center for short term acute rehab.
Required multiple medications for BM since on pain medications.
Will likely need bowel regimen for duration of tx with pain medications.

Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
