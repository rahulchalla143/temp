The patient was status post a motor vehicle crash vs a tree (high-speed) with extensive front end damage, +LOC.
It was decided the patient would require immediate irrigation and relocation of his injury in the OR with podiatry, which was accomplished without complication.
He underwent ORIF of the mandible without complication.
HD4 [**8-7**]: To floor, pain management, tolerating po intake, good urine output, passing flatus and stool, no other issues.
HD5 [**8-8**]: Continued post-op pain managed with narcotics and acetaminophen.
Psychiatry consulted per parents' request given h/o depression and EtOH abuse.
HD8 [**8-11**]: Pt returned to the OR with podiatry for percutaneous pinning of the right susentaculum tali and left foot/ankle ex fix with k wire pinning.
HD9 [**8-12**]: Pt did well clinically, but required significant pain management (accomplished by a combination of liquid and IV narcotic agents and ketorolac IV).
Pt had pain due to Foley, removed catheter himself, and allowed replacement when unable to void at 1000 mL on bladder scan.
HD10 [**8-13**]: Pt's post-operative pain continued to subside, requiring less narcotic therapy to maintain comfort.
HD11 [**8-14**]: Pt noted that his L hand was bothering him, and an x-ray was performed which revealed a minimally displaced nonangulated fracture to the proximal left 5th metacarpal (a Boxer's fracture); he was informed of his injury and minimally splinted by orthopedics.
Morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: Twenty (20) mL PO every [**3-23**] hours as needed for breakthrough pain.
