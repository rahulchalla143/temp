Admission Date:  [**2159-11-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2159-12-6**]   Service:  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient was admitted for shortness of breath and presented with lower extremity swelling and elevated cardiac enzymes.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was found to have an acute myocardial infarction and agreed to go to the Cardiac Catheterization Suite and was found to have multi-vessel coronary artery disease and moderate aortic stenosis.
The patient was found to have moderate aortic stenosis and multi-vessel coronary artery disease.
After careful consideration and given that she had a recent non-Q wave myocardial infarction, along with the catheterization findings the patient, after informed consent was obtained, decided to pursue an operative repair of these problems.
Immediately in the perioperative period, the patient was found to have ST segment changes.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained immediately postoperative which showed her ventricle to have some apical hypokinesia and inadequate filling.
Postoperatively, the patient was noted to have peak inspiratory pressures and was believed to have abdominal compartment syndrome.
She had her abdomen opened in the midline and a Shisker silo dressing was applied and was sewed to the abdominal wall.
Her ventilator was slowly weaned thereafter and on postoperative day three, the patient had her abdominal wound now closed in the midline, stapled, and she tolerated that.
On the ventilator, there was no change in her peak inspiratory pressures.
She intermittently required Dopamine for heart rate control as she tended to be bradycardic and Neo-Synephrine was used to maintain her blood pressure.
The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and on postoperative day seven went into atrial fibrillation.
She had a productive cough.
She remained afebrile with a stable hematocrit.
On [**12-6**], postoperative day eight from the exploratory laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome, postoperative day six from abdominal wall closure, she had several self-limiting runs of ventricular tachycardia, approximately six to eight beats long, with minimum decrease in her blood pressure and shortly thereafter was seen on the evening rounds after having labs sent off and was noted to have a decrease in her blood pressure significantly, dropped approximately 20 pounds, and continued in a ventricular tachycardia.
When her blood pressure dropped she had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed good right ventricular and left ventricular filling and then shortly thereafter she went in to ventricular tachycardia and had a full code performed.
Her chest was then opened, wires were cut, and after having several episodes of attempts at electro-cardioversion, externally, she had the internal lead paddles placed and was attempted internal cardioversion.
She continued to have intermittent periods of hypotension and she then had a #30 French intra-aortic balloon pump placed.
She had her sternum irrigated with two liters of Bacitracin solution and warm saline and her chest was closed with an Isotac cover after pacing wires were placed and a chest tube was placed.
The Attending, Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was present as well as the chief resident of Cardiac Surgery.
History of bright red blood with a recent colonoscopy and     a virtual colonoscopy.
History of atrial fibrillation after an myocardial     infarction with cardioversion to sinus rhythm in [**Month (only) 116**] of     [**2157**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.
Status post non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
Ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest.
