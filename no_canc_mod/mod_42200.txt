Mobilization, and resection of cholecystoduodenal fistula.
Common bile duct exploration with retrieval of multiple stones.
Transduodenal sphincteroplasty with removal of impacted stone.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65-year-old man who underwent a long hospitalization associated with bleeding duodenal ulcer 30 years ago, which resulted in a right thoracotomy, right subcostal incision, and a midline incision for distal gastrectomy with apparent Billroth II reconstruction.
His pain radiates to his chest.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found at the time of ERCP to have two stones within a dilated bile duct as well as a mass at the apex of the duodenum and unassociated cholecystoduodenal fistula.
He has no evidence of acute pulmonary disease, except for [**Last Name (un) 68224**] and has scattered bilateral liver hemangiomas and radiopaque material in the right upper quadrant, gallstones, and a contracted gallbladder.
Since his discharge from the hospital, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has continued to have periumbilical abdominal pain, which is stabbing and nonradiating.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] appears most likely to have had chronic cholecystitis, resulting in a cholecystoduodenal fistula and common bile duct stones.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is quite anxious about surgery, which will require reoperation through his right subcostal incision with repair of his cholecystoduodenal fistula, partial or total cholecystectomy, common bile duct exploration, and placement of a T-tube type biliary drain as access to the bile duct is not possible endoscopically.
Family History: Patient reports his father died of pancreatic cancer.
Site with mild erythema and minimal purulent drainage.

On [**2129-7-21**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, mobilization, and resection of cholecystoduodenal fistula, subtotal cholecystectomy, common bile duct exploration with retrieval of multiple stones, transduodenal sphincteroplasty with removal of impacted stone, Nissen closure of duodenum and placement of 12-French T tube, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and epidural catheter for pain control.
His epidural was splited on POD # 3 and Dilaudid PCA was added for better pain control.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
The patient subsequently voided without problem.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Wound care was done daily and no signs or symptoms of infection were noticed.
T-tube site has minimal purulent drainage around the tube.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Acute and chronic cholecystitis.
Cholecystoduodenal fistula.
Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Incision Care: *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
