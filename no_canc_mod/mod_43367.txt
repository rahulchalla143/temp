Admission Date:  [**2192-5-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-5-28**]   Service: MED  Allergies: Ativan / Haldol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 81 year old female with history of diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, chronic toe ulcer with history of osteomyelitis, and history of diverticulitis who initially presented to the ICU with fever, white cell count of 24 with 31%bands, sepsis, and lactate of 5 that dropped to 2 after receiving 750ml normal saline IVF.
Abdominal CT showed striated nephrogram in right kidney that may have been pyelonephritis or an infarct.
The patient has had a long history of a diabetic foot ulcer with progression of an infection that resulted in positive blood cultures.
She developed endocarditis and an infection in her right hand.
This resulted in an abscess of her PIP joint which was previously aspirated and sent for culture.
She also had a large abscess onthe dorsum of her hand as well as on her wrist.
She came back to the ICU on [**5-23**] with respiratory distress on mask ventilation.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2192-5-25**] IMPRESSION: Mitral valve structure attatched to the base of the posterior mitral leaflet with mobile components and a partial flail segment.
Findings are consistent with endocarditis.
Possible aortic valve involvement without significant aortic regurgitation.
No perivalvular abcess seen.
Compared to the prior study from [**2192-5-18**] (tape reviewed), there is a newly identifed mass (mobile components) at the base of the posterior mitral valve leaflet with severe eccentric mitral regurgitaiton  ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in echotexture without evidence of focal hepatic masses.
There is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Both kidneys appear unremarkable without evidence of perinephric fluid collection, hydronephrosis, or renal masses.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There is moderate left ventricular failure.
Unchanged appearance of multiple wedge-shaped areas of hypo-attenuation in the right kidney which likely represent multiple infarctions.
No evidence of bowel dilatation or wall thickening.
Stable appearance of the small left adrenal adenoma.
Extensive degenerative changes in the osseous structures.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 year old female with diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, and chronic diabetic foot ulcer previously admitted to ICU for MRSA bacteremia the transferred to the floor and developed right hand tenosynovitis and endocarditis with flail mitral valve.
Infectious Disease: The patient presented with fever, leukocytosis with bandemia, and high grade staph bacteremia.
She was treated with IV vancomycin without improvement.
She had multiple possible infectious sources: MRSA bacteremia, right wrist osteomyelitis, new murmur and new multivalve endocarditis of mitral and aortic valves with severe mitral valve regurgitation due to flail leaflet with vegetation., likely renal infarct, ischemic bowel, chronic foot ulcers.
The patient developed a very high white count and diarrhea due to C. Difficile.
Over the hospital course, she'd developed a new heart murmur with echocardiogram showing vegetations and severe mitral valve regurgitation.
Since she was not a good surgical candidate per vascular surgery consult, gentle afterload reduction if possible with nipride or hydralazine was recommended by the cardiology consult service.
Respiratory Distress:  This was likely a result of CHF superimposed on COPD.
She likely has both systolic and diastolic dysfunction, requiring rate and blood pressure control.
She was given nebulizer therapy and oxygen supplementation to maintain oxygen saturation in the setting of COPD and CHF.
She was given subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
Acute Renal Failure: The patient presented to the ICU with new ARF starting 7/1or [**5-25**] (creatinine 0.9->3.0 over 4 days after admission) that was likely secondary to a combination of low effective cardiac ejection, ATN from IV contrast dye, ongoing renal infarction, or infection.
There was no indication for hemodialysis.
GI: The patient had guiac positive stools and declining hematocrit, which the GI service attributed to gut hypoperfusion and likely ischemia.
She also had transaminitis likely secondary to bowel ischemia since RUQ ultrasound was negative for common bile duct dilatation.
Delirium: The patient had a variety of factors contributing to her delirium including metabolic, infectious, and medication causes.
On [**2192-5-28**], the patient was unresponsive and found to be breathless, pulseless, and without heart tones, blood pressure, and corneal reflexes.
