Admission Date:  [**2102-2-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-3-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-6-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**] Chief Complaint: Syncope, chest pain, shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: femoral line   History of Present Illness: 28 yo F on oral contraceptive pills with 10 day history of decreased mobility secondary to right ankle sprain, PMH of asthma, HTN, [**First Name3 (LF) 2320**], hyperlipidemia, and obesity presents with syncope, pleuritic chest pain, and SOB.
On Saturday evening ([**2-25**]), pt had syncopal event associated with diaphoresis, chest pain, and SOB while walking to the bathroom.
Apparently no fall or head trauma.
She had been having right calf pain as well, but attributed it to her ankle sprain.
Given concern for PE she was started on a heparin gtt at 10 PM (9500 unit bolus and then 2200 units per hour).
CTA revealed large bilateral PE in main pulmonary artery.
Cardiology team was aware; cath lab activated, however, it was felt thrombectomy was not indicated given thrombolysis with subsequent hemodynamic stability.
The pt underwent bilateral LENIs, which revealed a non-occlusive right popliteal vein thrombus.
- Obesity - OCP use with Kariva for past 8-9 years w/o prior complications.
- Recent torn right ankle ligament (10 days ago) with decreased mobility since, on crutches.
- s/p cholecystecomy, no complications.
- s/p salpingectomy for tubal cyst, no complications.
Family History: No known h/o clotting or PE.
However, two sisters with h/o bleeding problems: one s/p cholecystectomy and the other with uterine bleeding necessitating hysterecomy.
Oropharnyx erythematous secondary to ETT, no thrush or exudates.
Pulm: CTAB, no rhonchi, rales, or wheezes.
Cardiac: RRR, normal S1,S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
2+ edema in R LE, 1+ edema in L LE.
Mild calf tenderness on R, no calf tenderness on L.  No palpable cords.
No clubbing or cyanosis.
No focal deficits  Pertinent Results: Studies: ECG: sinus tach, rate 140, borderline RAD, nl intervals, S1,Q3,T3, no ST-T changes.
CXR [**2-25**]: No consolidation.
CTA [**2-25**]: There are large proximal filling defects present within both the right and left main pulmonary arteries extending into segmental branches of the right lower lobe, right middle lobe, left lower lobe, and left upper lobe consistent with massive bilateral pulmonary embolism.
The right upper lobe segmental branches are poorly visualized, also possibly suggesting embolic involvement.
There are patchy peripheral opacities in both the right and left lower lobes most consistent with atelectasis.
No pneumothorax is present.
A small partially occluding clot is seen within the right popliteal vein.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 28 yo F on oral contraceptive pills with 10 day h/o decreased mobility secondary to ankle sprain, asthma, HTN, [**Name (NI) 2320**], hyperlipidemia, and obesity admitted for bilateral massive pulmonary emboli c/b hemodynamic collapse.
Bilateral massive pulmonary emboli: She had several risk factors for developing PE, including OCP's, decreased mobility x 10 days secondary to right ankle sprain (with concomitant right calf pain for several days), and obesity.
LENI's revealed non-occlusive right popital thrombus.
Counseled to use alternate contraception (OCPs held) and to avoid pregnancy while on coumadin.
Will need out patient evaluation for underlying hypercoagulable states (in addition to those above), as this would potentially affect long term management.
