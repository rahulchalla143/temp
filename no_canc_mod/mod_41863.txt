History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 111228**] is a 57y/o gentleman with no significant PMH besides cigarette smoking  but strong family history of early CAD who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] due to chest pain that started yesterday morning, and is admitted to the CCU due to continued chest pain.
It did not radiate, and was not associated with shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis.
He sat in his car and the pain resolved in 10 minutes.
Then at 10PM last night the pain recurred while he was walking down the stairs to the basement but this time it did not resolve with rest.
He thought he might be having a heart attack but did not want to go to the hospital (he was terrified because his father died of an MI at age 39).
In the morning, he told his children about the continued chest pain and they insisted that he go to [**Hospital1 **].
For continued chest pain, he was given Morphine 5mg IV and was started on a Nitroglycerin drip which was uptitrated to 2.4 with resolution of his chest pain.
However, he complained of some left shoulder pain so was admitted to the CCU for closer observation.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
- Occupation: Photographer and also manages properties in [**Location (un) 111229**].
Family History: -Father reportedly had an MI at age 29, then died at age 39 of an MI -All of father's family died of cardiac disease -Mother died of MI at age 70.
HEENT: dry MM; sclera anicteric; EOMI NECK: no JVD CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ DP 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ DP 2+  On Discharge: Tm/Tc:98.8/98.5 HR:66-68 BP:104-117/67-79 RR:18-20 02 sat:97% RA  GENERAL: 57 yo M in no acute distress HEENT: mucous membs moist, no lymphadenopathy, JVP non elevated  CHEST: CTABL no wheezes, no rales, no rhonchi CV: S1 S2 Normal in quality and intensity RRR no murmurs rubs or gallops ABD: soft, non-tender, non-distended, BS normoactive.
EXT: wwp, no edema.
Currently, there is no evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusions, pulmonary edema or other acute lung changes.
LAD:  No angiographically-apparent CAD in the LAD.
Ulcerated proximal large diagonal with slow flow and 95% stenosis.
Color Doppler study showed a trace shunt across the interatrial septum consistent with a stretched patent foramen ovale (or very small atrial septal defect).
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to apical anterior and apical lateral hypokinesis/akinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 111228**] is a 57y/o gentleman with CAD risk factors of cigarette use and early family history of CAD who presented after a day of with chest pain with abnormal EKG and elevated cardiac enzymes consistent with myocardial infarction.
Chest pain, abnormal EKG, elevated cardiac enzymes: MI.
Patient presented with an MI that was likely >24 hours old.
EKG without ST elevations but anterior Q waves which could in fact represent a missed STEMI.
Cardiac enzymes consistent with a large territorial infarction.
His chest pain was controlled on Heparin gtt, Integrillin gtt, NTG gtt, ASA, and Plavix overnight.
On the morning after admission, he was taken to the cath lab and was found to have 90% occlusion of large diag branch, and as this was likely the culprit lesion it was stented with a DES resulting in good coronary flow.
He remained hemodynamically stable with no complications.
TTE showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LV EF 50-55%) with mid to apical anterior and apical lateral hypokinesis/akinesis.
Rigors and fever to 102.9 developed post cardiac catherization.
Questionable whether this was contrast-related reaction though Interventional Cardiology Attending indicated that patient showed no signs of reaction with any contrast load during procedure.
Rigors and fevers did not develop until Protamine was infused during closing of femoral artery.
Mild leukocytosis: resolved, likely related to MI.
No localizing signs/symptoms, and WBC differential not concerning for acute infection.
Disp:*30 Tablet Extended Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: myocardial infarction coronary artery disease Tobacco abuse   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because you had a heart attack.
You underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure and were found to have a blockage in one of the heart's arteries, which was stented open.
We made the following changes to your medications: -START Aspirin 81mg daily (over the counter "baby-dose aspirin") -START Plavix (for at least 1 year, please discuss this plan with your Cardiologist) -START Atorvastatin for cholesterol -START Metoprolol (to protect the heart from having another heart attack) - START nitroglycerin as needed when you have chest pain.
Take one tablet under the tongue, wait 5 minutes, then take another tablet if the chest pain is still there.
Call 911 for chest pain that does not go away after 2 tablets, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] if you use any nitroglycerin at all.
