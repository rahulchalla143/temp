She has a rash on her left chest for several weeks, which is improving.
ROS negative for diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, joint pain, melena, bright red blood per rectum, epistaxis, hemoptysis, or hematemsis.
She has had mild nausea with no emesis since arriving from OSH.

Physical Exam: On admission:36.0 75 85/48 RR17 97% RA General: elderly woman, awake, AAOx3, in no acute distress HEENT: PERRLA, no scleral icterus, normocephalic, atraumatic; pus noted to be draining from right external auditory canal.
No skin erythema or periauricular lymphadenopathy Neck: supple, no JVD Lungs: clear anterior field Heart: 4/6 systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur radiating to neck bilaterally Abdomen: soft, non-tender Extremities: warm, well-perfused bilaterally; dressing in place with ttp over lateral left hip, which is deviated outward w/ external rotation Neurological: moving all extremities, feet warm and well-perfused bilaterally without edema .
On discharge: 97.4 89 74-89 117/66 R24 98% RA General: elderly woman, awake, AAOx3, anxious HEENT: PERRLA, no scleral icterus, normocephalic, atraumatic Neck: supple, no JVD Lungs: clear anterior field Heart: 3/6 systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur radiating to neck bilaterally Abdomen: soft, non-tender Extremities: warm, well-perfused bilaterally; dressing in place over L hip, pneumoboots in place.
Neurological: moving all extremities, feet warm and well-perfused bilaterally without edema Skin: open lesions in L T5 dermatomal distribution, also with several vesicular lesions on an errythematous base on trunk and LEs.
Mildly displaced and impacted intertrochanteric fracture of L femur with superior displacement of distal fragment is redemonstrated.
Severe L hip joint DJD without dislocation of femoral head.
Probable diffuse bony demineralizaiton.
Chest x-ray ([**4-7**]): Severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement have worsened indicating progressive cardiac decompensation.
Left lower lobe remains severely consolidated.
Whether this is due to lower lobe collapse or pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate.
Heavy calcification in the heart that could be due to severe aortic stenosis and mitral annulus degeneration respectively would require a lateral view for localization.
Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**4-8**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical aneurysm and near akinesis of all segments except for the basal inferolateral wall.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with extensive regional dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The patient has severe aortic stenosis.
Based on [**2138**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is symptomatic (angina, syncope, CHF) and a surgical candidate, surgical intervention has been shown to be beneficial.
CT orbit, sella, and IAC without contrast ([**4-8**]): Bilateral soft tissue masses centered within the external auditory canals most likely represent keratosis obturans, more advanced on the right.
Additional differential considerations include cholesteatomas.
More aggressive etiologies such as squamous cell carcinoma are unlikely.
Coronary angigoraphy in this right-dominant system demonstrated no flow-limiting coronary disease.
The LAD had a 20% proximal stenosis and a 40% mid-vessel stenosis.
A small first diagonal branch was totally occluded proximally.
The LCx had no angigoraphically apparent disease.
The RCA had mild luminal irregularities.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided fillign pressures, with an RVEDP of 20 mm HG and a PCWP of 25 mm Hg.
There was sevrere pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension, with a PASP of 84 mm Hg.
No flow-limiting disease in the LMCA, LAD, LCx or RCA.
Elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Trabecular bone fragments with intramedullary hemorrhage, necrosis, fibrin, and acute and chronic inflammation, consistent with fracture site.
Articular cartilage with degenerative changes.
There is adequate alignment of the left hip prosthesis.
There is no evidence of CHF.
Moderate cardiomegaly has improved.
Radiolucency projecting in the retrocardiac region is a large hiatal hernia.
Bibasilar atelectases are larger on the left side, superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded.
MICRO: Skin scrapings    Direct Antigen Test for Herpes Simplex Virus Types 1 & 2 (Final       [**2143-4-16**]):    Negative for Herpes simplex by immunofluorescence.
Viral antigen identified by immunofluorescence.
BACTERIAL CXS PENDING ON DC  External auditory canal:    GRAM STAIN (Final [**2143-4-8**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
IN PAIRS AND SHORT CHAINS.
HEAVY GROWTH BACTERIA RESEMBLING NORMAL SKIN/RESPIRATORY FLORA.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
A swab is not the optimal specimen for recovery of mycobacteria or       filamentous fungi.
Whenever possible tissue biopsy or aspirated fluid should       be submitted.
URINE CX: NO GROWTH   Brief Hospital Course: In summary this is an 85-year-old woman with critical AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.5 cm2) presenting from OSH for treatment of left-hip fracture after mechanical fall at home.
Patient with evidence of left intertrochanteric fracture on OSH plain films.
With respect to her perioperative risk, she has no history of MI (NSTEMI in [**10/2142**] was likely demand-related per OSH records), stroke, IDDM, or CKD.
She does have history of decompensated CHF in 12/[**2141**].
Currently with no signs or symptoms of decompensated CHF.
Pain well controlled after procedure and pt started on Lovenox x1 month.
# Hypotension.
This was felt to be secondary to intravascular volume depletion, blood loss from fracture, and severe AS/systolic dysfunction.
# Aortic stenosis.
She has critical aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of less than 0.8 cm2.
# Paroxysmal afib: in NSR this admission.
# Acute on chronic sCHF: pt with some evidence of volume overload this admission, requiring 1-2 L O2 by nasal cannula, weaned by time of admission with sats in 90s.
Also could be due to stress rx in setting or recent surgery.
Concern for superinfx of rash with pseudomonas, which is being treated with topical abx.
Urine cx with no growth.
Would recommend monitoring fever curve/WBC while in rehab.
# Soft tissue in the right external auditory canal: per OSH CT report.
Exam was notable for pus in the right external auditory canal.
ENT service was consulted and  noted the left ear with impacted cerumen; right ear had a perforated tympanic membrane and whitish fluid; suspect cholesteatooma; no antibiotics needed but will need outpatient follow-up.
# Overactive bladder: she was continued on tolterodine .
# Vaginal itch: she was started on a course of clotrimazole.
# Code status.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.

Secondary Diagnoses Critical aortic stenosis Hypertension Chronic diastolic heart failure Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You have severe narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart and as a result underwent pre-surgical evaluation.
In addition, during this admission you were noted to have a  cholesteatoma in your right ear.
- we STOPPED your lisinopril - we STOPPED your furosemide - we STOPPED your potassium - we ADDED quetiapine (seroquel) - we ADDED Neomycin-Bacitracin-Polymyxin for your rash - we ADDED clotrimazole for yeast infection - we ADDED a bowel regimen because you have not moved your bowels recently.
Please note your follow-up appointments below, and please call the doctor should you develop worsening pain, fevers, chills, chest pain or pressure, worsening fatigue, or other new concerning symptoms.
