Hypotension status post cath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year-old male with CAD status post four vessel CABG in [**2096**], admitted to [**Hospital6 2910**] on [**2106-3-10**] with left sided chest pain with shortness of breath, positive lightheadedness, positive nausea.
He had diagnostic catheterization and was sent to [**Hospital1 346**] for therapeutic catheterization.
Catheterization on [**2106-3-12**] showed reportedly an 80% left circumflex stenosis and a questionable stenosis of the LAD.
The patient was noted to have an episode of chest pain with shortness of breath during the catheterization associated with brief, no reflow after dilation of the saphenous vein graft to LAD with decreased blood pressures to systolic to 70s to 80s.
The patient was treated with Dopamine drip and nitrites with prompt resolution of chest pain.
Denies PND, claudication, bright red blood per rectum or melena.
The patient does note chest pain at rest of approximately one to two times per month similar to the pain that he experienced prompting admission.
The patient however notes that the chest pain that precipitated admission was longer in duration and had associated shortness of breath which his normal rest angina does not.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2096**] four vessel, status post catheterization in [**2103**] no stenting performed.
Diet controlled diabetes mellitus.
History of hypercholesterolemia but intolerance to statins.
Glaucoma bilaterally.
FAMILY HISTORY: Brothers and father in CAD in 30s and 40s.
Bilateral surgical pupils.
Neck - soft and supple.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
No hematoma, no bruit, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
IMPRESSION:  A 67 year-old male with CAD status post catheterization for work up of unstable angina complicated by no reflow after dilatation of stent to LAD leading to hypotension and chest pain.
CARDIOVASCULAR - The patient had no further episodes of hypotension or chest pain while an inpatient at [**Hospital1 346**].
Post catheterization check to the groin revealed no hematoma or bruit.
The patient was maintained on Integrilin for 18 hours post catheterization as well as a nitroglycerin drip prn for chest pain.
HEMATOLOGY - The patient's hematocrit was noted to be stable with no need for transfusion.
The patient's platelets were also stable with no thrombocytopenia secondary to Integrilin use.
RENAL - The patient's BUN and creatinine remained stable post catheterization with no signs of dye induced nephropathy.
ENDOCRINE - As above patient with diet controlled diabetes mellitus.
The patient's blood sugars were monitored [**Hospital1 **] with a regular sliding scale insulin for coverage however the patient was not in need of such coverage.
Coronary artery disease status post four vessel CABG in [**2096**].
Diet controlled diabetes mellitus.
