Admission Date:  [**2114-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-8-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-1-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: s/p cardiac arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ICD placment  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 85008**] is a 47 year old man recently diagnosed with atrial flutter s/p DCCV x2 as well as ablation, and cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology (EF15-20%) who is transferred from [**Hospital1 **] after arresting at home and receiving AED shock for hypothermia protocol.
On that admission he was diagnosed with atrial flutter and "ischemic" global cardiomyopathy, moderate RV hypokinesis, EF of 15-20%, 3-4% MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] his wife, the etiology of his cardiomyopathy was suspected to be secondary to viral illness.
He soon became unresponsive and lost consciousness.
She states that prior to him losing consciousness he did not complain of chest pain or pressure, palpitation, shortness of breath.
He has not had any recent fevers, chills, changes in bladder habits, bloody stools/urine, lower or extremity edema.
He was found to be in atrial fibrillation.
He became hypotensive and was then started on neo and levo for pressure support.
The patient's ECG showed atrial fibrillation with 1mm lateral STD.
He got CXR that was consistent with pulmonary edema.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - [**6-/2114**]: Atrial flutter diagnosed after 15lbs weight loss and prolonged malaise.
S/p DC cardioversion x 2 and [**Year (4 digits) **] + Aflutter ablation on [**2114-7-23**] with creation of a cavo-tricuspid isthmus line of block with bidirectional block.
- Cardiomyopathy identified on ECHO at OSH on [**2114-7-6**]: Severe ischemic, nearly global cardiomyopathy present with "smoke" in the LV.
Moderate RV hypokinesia.
Sclera anicteric.
Irregularly irregular heart rate.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: Anterior breath sounds clear, no wheezes/rales.
Cooling pads in place; no organomegaly noted.
No edema noted.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
[**2114-7-30**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20%).
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biventricular cavity enlargement with severe global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
[**2114-8-4**] CXR: New ICD has been placed with leads terminating in expected locations of the right atrium and right ventricle with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Ground-glass and reticular opacities have developed in the perihilar regions, with similar appearance to an earlier radiograph of [**8-2**].
The rapid fluctuations favor pulmonary edema over an atypical pneumonia.
There is also an area of linear atelectasis in the right mid lung region, and there are questionable small pleural effusions posteriorly.
[**2114-8-5**] EKG: Supraventricular tachycardia.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 year old man recently diagnosed with atrial flutter s/p DCCV x2 as well as ablation, and cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology (EF15-20%) who is transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after arresting at home and receiving AED shock for hypothermia protocol.
The etiology of his V-fib arrest was suspected to be secondary to his dilated cardiomyopathy vs prolonged QT.
His amiodarone drip was continued on transfer but stopped given evidence of junctional rhythm w/ prolonged QT (see below).
EEG did not show evidence of seizures.
An echocardiogram was done on this admission that confirmed dilated cardiomyopathy.
On [**10-3**], patient went into VF arrest on the floor and was taken for urgent ICD placement with overdrive pacing.
# Cardiomyopathy:  An echocardiogram done on this admission showed biventricular cavity enlargement with severe global hypokinesis EF 20%, and moderate MR.  Etiology of his cardiomyopathy unknown, but suspected tachycardiac dilated CM.
# Atrial Flutter:  On admission patient was in atrial flutter.
Overnight, rhythm strips and ECG demonstrated junctional rhythm and prolonged QT.
Subsequent ECGs showed atrial flutter.
# Elevated TSH:  TSH 12, free T3/T4 within normal limits.
Outpatient Lab Work INR check   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Ventricular fibrillation Post cardiac arrest Dilated cardiomyopathy   Discharge Condition: A&Ox3, self-ambulatory   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you had a cardiac arrest.
Soon afterwards, you had another episode of abnormal rhythm.
For this reason we placed a defibrillator to prevent further arrhythmias.
