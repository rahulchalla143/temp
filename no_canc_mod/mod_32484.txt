At that time she sufferred intraventricular hemorrhage and interglutteal hemorrhage in her R iliacus muscle, leading to Hct drop requiring 4 units pRBC and ICU level care.
There she was found to have extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with RV dilatation (RV:LV ratio 2:1) as well as evidence of apiration.
Given recent bleed, cardiac surgery was called and doesn't want to intervene.

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 41033**] was a 79 year-old woman with recent intracranial and intramuscular bleed on [**11-8**] who presented from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital with saddle pulmonary embolism.
# Pulmonary emboli: She was found to have sub-massive pulmonary embolism on CT scan.
Given her recent large intergluteal and smaller intracranial bleed, anticoagulation was witheld initially.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and did not advise an invasive procedures at that time.
Lower extremity ultrasound revealed  extensive bilateral DVTs.
A TTE demonstrated a dilated R ventricle without conclusive evidence regarding intracardiac shunt.
In addition, general surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] to determine stability of intragluteal bleed (that occured [**11-8**].)
# Intracranial hemorrhage: She was evaluated by neurosurgery and determined to be stable for anticoagulation from a neurosurgical standpoint.
# Intergluteal hematoma: Her intramuscular bleed was monitored with serial hematocrit checks that remained stable.
There were no findings to suggest that her hematoma was not resolving.
# Dementia with possible acute encephalopathy:  Her mental status waxed and waned, but was at baseline per her family.
She seldom became agitated in the evening and responded well to re-orientation in these circumstanses.
