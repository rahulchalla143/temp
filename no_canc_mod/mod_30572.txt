Pt had a second episode of SOB overnight, satting 70-80% on mask at 8L and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Patient was non-communicative at time of exam and history was obtained from medical record and from family report.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He has a chronic raspy cough per the daughter.
She has noted that he had ankle edema ("elephant legs") in the late winter and early spring and had asked [**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life to start the patient on Lasix.
Daughter denies any syncope or presyncope.
He has poor functional capacity at baseline.
HTN 4.
Depression 6.
Vascular dementia 9.
Pacemaker c/b lead thrombus.
Previously followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for "episodic unreponsiveness."
Recently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]/[**Doctor Last Name **] for the thrombus, anticoagulation deferred for h/o falls, unsteady gait, and confusion.
11. s/p hip fracture requiring ORIF in [**3-/2172**] with a complicated medical course including hypoxic respiratory failure.
Chronic diastolic dysfunction.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
No murmurs noted.
Decreased breath sounds throughout, diffuse rhonchi.
No crackles, wheezes.
Abd: Normoactive, soft, NT/ND, No HSM.
No abdominial bruits.
Trace pedal edema bilaterally.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2173-8-12**] 4:03 AM UPRIGHT PORABLE CHEST Streaky linear atelectasis is noted extending from the region of the right hila and at the left base in this patient with persistent low lung volumes.
No evidence of interstitial pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with stable appearance to abnormal contour projecting above the aortic knob consistent with the patient's known pseudoaneurysm.
A 4.5 cm round density projected adjacent to the aortic knob, consistent with a known aortic pseudoaneurysm is unchanged.
A bipolar transvenous pacemaker remains in place.
IMPRESSION: Streaky density in the retrocardiac area that may represent partial atelectasis or consolidation.
Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
No definite interval change.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 87yo man with a history of Diabetes, Hypertension, diastolic CHF, s/p pacemaker, CKD, Parkinson's, and vascular dementia who presented for SOB/hypoxia and found to be in hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure requiring BiPap.
# Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure:  The patient was hypoxic on admission with  SpO2 76% on NRB and an arterial blood gas of 7.34/66/53.
The patient had no history of COPD or asthma.
His acute hypoxia was felt to be due to diastolic heart failure, although CXR appeared to have mild pulmonary edema without significant change from [**4-22**].
The patient was afebrile, without cough, fever or leukocytosis.
PE was considered given a previously noted thrombus in the RA and the patient's poor functional capacity at baseline.
However, repeat ECHO was without evidence of thrombus and there was no evidence of DVT on physical exam.
Over the course of hospitalization the patient had marked improvement in his supplemental oxygen requirements and at the time of discharge he was sating well on 4L of oxygen.
# Diastolic CHF:  The patient had an Echocardiogram in [**Month (only) **] with evidence of mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and diastolic dysfunction.
On presentation this admission, the patient lacked overt volume overload on arrival and chest xray was not remarkably changed from previous exams.
Repeat ECHO showed little change since previous exam.
# HTN:  The patient was noted to be hypertensive during admission, with systolic blood pressures to the 160's/170's.
He was initially started on a Nitro drip for immediate blood pressure control.
# CAD/Ischemia: The patient had an episode of chest pain.
Cardiac enzymes were unremarkable with troponin was slightly elevated in setting of chronic renal failure, possible demand ischemia from diastolic CHF.
The patient had no known history of CAD and no evidence of acute ischemic changes on EKG.
# CRI (baseline Cr 1.3-1.7):  The patient had a history of chronic renal insufficiency and on arrival, his creatinine was at baseline.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: diastolic Heart Failure HTN Type 2 DM CRI (1.3-1.7)  Secondary: Diverticulosis, s/p partial colectomy Depression Parkinson's disease Dementia-vascular on MRI [**2162**] Pacemaker  Discharge Condition: The patient was hemodynamically stable, afebrile and without pain.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of shortness of breath.
It was felt that your symptoms were realated to poor heart function.
If you have a weight gain > 3lbs, you should take an EXTRA dose of Lasix (40 mg) in the evening.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop chest pain, increased shortness of breath, numbness or tingling in your arm, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills or any other symptoms of concern.
