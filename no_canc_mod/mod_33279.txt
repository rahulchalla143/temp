As noted above, she has a history of worsening dyspnea over the past few months that has been treated with antibiotics and steroids.
She presented to OSH on [**2111-6-3**] with worsening dyspnea and had a fever to 103F, and was started on ceftriaxone/azithromycin ([**Date range (1) 83455**]) for pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
She developed an increasing oxygen requirement, however, and initially required nasal canula (94% on 1 L O2) but later required face mask (86% on 15 L on [**6-7**]).
Her CXR, which initially was read as negative for infiltrate, progressively worsening, with increasingly prominent diffuse bilateral infiltrates, right greater than left.
She also had a negative chest CTA.
With an oxygen requirement that was rising and worsening dyspnea, she was transitioned to vanc/zosyn/levo and then vanc/zosyn/ceftaz ([**Date range (1) 83456**]; ceftaz started [**6-8**]; levo on [**4-21**]) because of an allergy to levofloxacin.
It is unclear why she received double coverage for gram negatives.
On [**6-7**], she was admitted to the ICU and intubated electively for hypoxia and SOB.
Phenylephrine was started because of hypotension to SBPs in the 80s after being intubated and starting on propofol ([**Date range (1) 83456**]), which had to be uptitrated for sedation.

[**2111-6-8**] BAL Flow Cytometry: There is an immuonphenotypically abnormal CD138+/CD56+ cell population that most likely represents the highly atypical plasmacytoid immunoblasts seen on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4427**]-Giemsa stained cytocentrifuge preparation of the submitted bronchioalveolar lavage fluid.
The significance of this finding in the context of an acute viral illness is unclear.

Consolidation in the posterior segment of right upper lobe and superior segment of right lower lobe likely aspiration pneumonia.
Atelectasis is in the bases of the lungs.
Given the fact that there is no cardiomegaly or pleural effusions, diffuse ground-glass opacity is probably not cardiogenic in origin.

# Respiratory failure/pneumonia: She was intubated for worsening hypoxia on [**2111-6-7**] at the OSH in the setting of pneumonia and worsening bilateral infiltrates.
Her course was notable for progressive worsening of her respiratory status during her OSH hospitalization, along with development of bilateral infiltrates.
At the time of transfer, her CXR, large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2 were thought to be consistent with ARDS/acute lung injury, and mechanical ventilation settings targeted low tidal volumes and high respiratory rate.
However, despite this, her lung was compliant, with low peak inspiratory pressures.
Culture data from the OSH eventually demonstrated MRSA in her sputum culture and she was initially managed with vancomycin/zosyn and then zosyn was discontinued, and she was given a course of solumedrol because of her history of question COPD.
The ID service was consulted and recommended switching from vancomycin to linezolid and empirically completing a course of oseltamavir Of note, she also underwent a repeat chest CTA that was negative for PE and a TTE with a bubble study that was limited in quality but negative for intracardiac shunt.
She continued to require high PEEP with hypoxia if PEEP was lower than 10.
Diuresis was tried several times with minimal change in PEEP.
Linezolid was switched back to vancomycin given concern for lactic acidosis.
A PICC line was placed on [**2111-6-25**] for long term antibiotics.
# Afib with RVR: Patient developed AF with RVR and hypotension.
No evidence of PE on CTA chest or right heart strain on echo; normal atria.
# Volume overload: The patient was volume overloaded after about 1 week in the ICU.
Of note, she was on acetazolamide for a few days due to metabolic alkosis but this was discontinued as bicarb normalizing.
She was started on oral fluconazole on [**2111-7-2**] due to persistent yeast-positive urine cultures despite changing out Foley catheters.
Ophthalmology was consulted and did not see evidence of endopthalmitis.
CT Head was done [**7-4**] which showed no acute process and a TTE was without vegitations.
# Vaginal Bleeding: She was noted to have vaginal bleeding after a week in the hospital.
She was evaluated by OB GYN who could not find evidence of further bleeding.
# Hypertriglyceridemia: TG elevated to 303 in setting of propofol gtt.
# Atyical BAL pathology: Tissue from bronch done on [**5-31**] showed atypical plasmacytoid immunoblasts with abnormal CD138+/CD56+ cell population on flow cytometry.
Significance unclear in in the context of an acute viral illness and a reactive process was favored, although a lymphoproliferative disorder could not be ruled out.
Repeat bronch on [**6-17**] with path read of "lymphocytes, alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and rare plasma cells with insufficient tissue for immunohistochemical characterization"; cytology negative for malignant cells.
# Diabetes: Required insulin drip temporarily for elevated blood glucose but transitioned back to ISS with glargine with good control.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine.
