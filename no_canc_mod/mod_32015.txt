No further episodes of status while in-house, although noted to have short episodes of seizures in lower extremities that would subside with Ativan.
Hospital course complicated by NSTEMI with troponins to 0.9.
Cardiology was consulted and thought NSTEMI due to demand ischemia likely related to peri-intubation hypotension (transiently required neo gtt in ICU).
Also noted to have a PNA (fevers, leukocytosis, and RLL consolidation), started on Vancomycin and Zosyn on [**2-19**] at OSH, which have been continued to date.
Was ?receiving fluids when noted to be having difficulty with respiration.
Received 1 dose of solumedrol for wheezing on [**2-23**].
Med/[**Female First Name (un) 1634**] consult called for management of respiratory issues on [**2-24**], noted to be volume overloaded/with crackles on exam after getting maitenence fluids o/n.
Repeat ABG shows increased hypoxia on same oxygen settings and worsening A-a gradient (570=>583, normal 19).

Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
This most likely represents atelectasis and pleural effusion, though the possibility of supervening pneumonia cannot be definitely excluded.
~ [**2173-2-23**]: Moderate cardiomegaly is exaggerated by lordotic positioning, but has probably increased consistent with an enlarging heart, and/or pericardial effusion.
Azygos distention indicates worsening elevated central venous pressure.
There is no pulmonary edema, but left lower lobe consolidation persists, either atelectasis or pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax.
Left lower lobe consolidation, right basilar atelectasis, and small bilateral pleural effusions slightly improved.
ECHO: ~[**2173-2-20**]: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease or stress cardiomyopathy.
~[**2173-2-25**]: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
MICRO: AFB smear neg x 3, cultures pending Urine and blood cultures neg   Brief Hospital Course: Brief Hospital Summary: 66 yo M with seizure disorder after EEE infection and former EtOH abuser who was transferred from an OSH in status epilepticus.
Hospital course complicated by an NSTEMI resulting in depressed LV ejection fraction, ventilator associated pneumonia treated with 8 day course of Vancomycin and Zosyn, and hypoxic respiratory distress due to volume overload from depressed LV ejection fraction.
Hospital Course by Problem:  # Status Epilepticus: Patient initially presented to the Neuro ICU intubated in status epilepticus, likely in setting of subtherapeutic dilantin level.
Unlikely meningitis given lack of nuchal rigidity.
His mental status exam eventually improved, and his seizure medications were changed to keppra 1500 mg PO BID, dilantin 300 mg PO QHS (with therapeutic dilantin levels), and klonopin 1.5 mg PO QHS on discharge.
Given prn Ativan for seizures > 3min.
# Hypoxia: Patient became acute hypoxic on the floor after being called out from the ICU, presumably in the setting of continous IVFs and decreased LV ejection fraction of 30%.
Aspiration pneumonia may also have contributed to hypoxia.
He was transferred to the MICU after remaining on the floor for 6 hours due to concern for hypoxic respiratory distress and aggressively diuresed with IV lasix and treated with standing nebulizers.
# Ventilator associated pneumonia: Patient noted to have leukocytosis and left lower lobe infiltrate on CXR, likely VAP versus aspiration PNA during seizures 9Could not distinguish between the two).
# TB exposure: Recent exposure to family member who died of TB of [**2173-2-2**].
# NSTEMI: Patient suffered an NSTEMI likely due to demand ischemia (hypotensive and tachycardic in the neuro ICU after intubation requiring transient neosynephrine gtt) versus Takatsubo/stress cardiomyopathy.
Patient will need a stress test as outpatient  # Pump: Patient had pulmonary edema with poor EF% (20-25%) which improved to 30% on repeat TTE, likely due to recent myocardial insult.
# Rhythm: No arrythmias noted on telemetry.
Continued telemetry   # EtOH use:  No signs of withdrawal.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation twice a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

In the course of your hospital stay, you suffered a heart attack that damaged the pumping function of your heart, a pneumonia that was treated with antibiotics, and volume overload and difficulty breathing.
Please return to the ED or call your PCP if you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers > 101 F, swelling in your legs, weight gain greater than 3 lbs in one day, or any symptoms concerning enough to you to warrant physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 35843**].
