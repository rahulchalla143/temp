History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 27218**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hx of recent cdiff [**1-26**], hip fracture [**11-23**], admission for massive GIB [**12-26**] who was referred to the ED by VNA with fever, increased diarrhea, mild dyspnea, and hypotension.
She has been having diarrhea for 3 days.
She had many stools which smelled concerning for Cdiff.
She underwent a CTA and CT abd/pelvis which was consistent with colitis, but showed no megacolon.
PNA with hypoxia initially prior to CXR which was clear), and 500 mg of flagyl.
On arrival to the ICU, pt states she is doing ok. She appears confused and slow to answer questions.
Pt also states she has had a cough recently  Past Medical History: 1.

She drinks wine very rarely on holidays and denies any history of other drugs.
Family History: Mother has h/o of loss of consciousness from "heart problems" that eventually caused her death.
Father died of cirrhosis (non-alcoholic).
Physical Exam: VS: T=, BP=110/70, HR=90, RR=15, O2 sat=100%RA GENERAL: Elderly white female in no apparent distress.
Sclera anicteric.
Mucous membranes are moist NECK: Supple with JVP of 10cm CARDIAC: Irregular rhythm, rate controlled, no murmurs.
LUNGS: Diffuse bilateral wheezes and late inspiratory crackles.
ABDOMEN: Non distended, soft, mild tenderness to deep palpation in the peri-umbilical region.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Moderate pancolitis and proctitis.
This can be secondary to pseudomembranous colitis or other infectious/inflammatory etiology.
Ischemic etiology is less likely due to distribution.
L1 severe compression fracture with 5mm of retropulsion is new since [**2123-12-24**].
C. difficile colitis: Patient presented with profuse diarrhea up to 2 gallons every couple of hours (per ED report) and was found to be hypotensive with a lactate of 3.2 and Cr of 1.3 from a baseline of <1.0.
She was initially admitted to the MICU where she was given IVF resuscitation, started on IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin (125 mg q6h) and  flexiseal was placed as patient was producing a very large amount of diarrhea (>2 L daily).
CT abd/pel showed toxic megacolon with colon measuring >6 cm and C diff testing subsequently was found to be positive.
Her hypotension and ARF resolved with IVF and she was subsequently transferred to the medical floor.
On the medical floor she continued to have profuse diarrhea and her PO vancomycin was subsequently increased to 500 mg q6h.
Her flexiseal was removed early in her course but her abdomen became distended very rapidly and this was re-introduced.
Given the severity of her disease and her DNR/DNI status a conversation was held with the patient about colectomy which was the only viable option for cure at the time.
After this was done she continued to have diarrhea but its amount reduced throughout the hospitalization.
?s course was complicated by persistent electrolyte abnormalitis, including potassium, magnesium, calcium and bicarbonate loss due to the large amount of diarrhea that she was producing daily and her NPO status.
This was attributed to the severity of her disease and her long hospital course.
This was thought to represent pre-renal azotemia due to severe dehydration as it resolved after IVF resuscitation.
