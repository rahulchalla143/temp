Admission Date:  [**2182-9-8**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2106-2-27**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MICU GREEN  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical problems who had an increasing respiratory rate and tachycardia in the settings of new fever that was intubated in the Emergency Department upon arrival from the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] who became profoundly hypotensive.
The patient recently had a prolonged ICU course for CHF, A fib complicated by ventilator-associated Enterobacter pneumonia that was extubated on [**2182-9-4**].
On the day of admission, the patient spiked a temperature to 101 and then was started on Oxacillin and Flagyl for proctitis.
This morning, he had an increasing respiratory rate to 48.
The decision to intubate made by the staff for change in mental status.
Per the ED staff, the patient had no peritoneal signs on examination.
Chest x-ray on arrival was concerning for a volvulus with fine air under the diaphragm.
ET tube placement complicated by profound hypotension to systolic blood pressures of 35/18.
Repeat laboratories showed a decrease in the white blood cell count from 21 to 18 and his bicarbonate decreased from 36 to 32, lactate 2.2.
Chest x-ray showed left effusion, small lung volumes, mild CHF.
EKG showed rapid atrial fibrillation without any ST changes.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  There were multiple etiologies including COPD, restrictive lung disease due to a scoliosis, and it is believed that at baseline the patient's 02 saturations are in the 90s and he is a C02 retainer.
There is a report of his baseline respiratory rate being in the mid 30s.
The patient was intubated until [**2182-9-13**] without complication.
He was maintained on either AC ventilation or pressure support.
Extubation occurred without complication and currently the patient requires frequent suctioning of bloody thick secretions but is not intubated.
At this time, we still have no source of the Enterococcus.
RAPID ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient in the face of his hypotension had decompensated rate control.
The patient's Coumadin was held and heparin was restarted but is being currently held due to a left internal jugular or left neck hematoma that developed upon trying to insert a central venous line.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient had a normal EF, but most likely has diastolic dysfunction.
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient had a right RCA completely occluded and it was felt that he had a watershed infarct.
There is a history of supposedly him having embolic strokes but this does not quite fit with the watershed infarcts.
It is unclear if he might have sustained some anoxic brain injury.
HEMATOCRIT:  The patient had an acute decrease when admitted of his hematocrit from 34 to 24, unclear if this was dilutional from the fluid that he received but his hematocrit remained stable in the 28s to 30s range since.
The CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
He remained Guaiac positive and his NG tube did suction for coffee grounds.
His heparin was being held at this time but the patient should be anticoagulated for concerns of his atrial fibrillation and the question of whether he had an embolic stroke.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  He required to be often repleted for potassium and had a very elevated scale.
We have had multiple consults with the patient's daughter and have had difficulty obtaining consent for procedures due to her elusiveness.
