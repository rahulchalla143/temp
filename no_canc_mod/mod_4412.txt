Compared to the previous tracing of [**2152-12-28**] no major change.
No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or consolidation is detected.
CXR [**7-6**]: Proper placement of lead, no pneumothorax.
Rhythm:  Pt presented with bradycardia in a rhythm of complete heart block secondary to his pacemaker not capturing.
He has a history of AVN ablation.
Initial bradycardia was likely d/t failure to capture, based on OSH ECG, likely problem with [**Name2 (NI) **] lead.
During his time in the CCU, his rhythm alternated between pacing by his native pacemaker at a rate of 60, pacing by his temporary pacemaker at a rate of 50, and some very short instances when neither [**Month/Day (4) **] sensed or captured.
These instances were seen on tele and lasted a few seconds at most.
Per EP, Cefazolin 2g IV q8 x3, last dose at 8am today, and Cephalexin 500g q8 x 5days for post-procedural prophylaxis.
He was set up with home nursing for dressing changes and PT.
Complete heart block secondary to pacemaker malfunction.
HTN 2.
Afib s/p AVN ablation 3.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a low heart rate which was due to a problem with your pace maker.
You should also follow up with your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2974**] to have an incision check.
