No murmur appreciated Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Mild bibasilar crackles.
No abdominial bruits.
No to trace peripheral edema.
Although the lungs are clear except for minimal bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis.
No appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated.
Another lead most likely external or subcutaneous is noted, changing its position compared to the prior films.
Left atrial abnormality.
Consider inferior myocardial infarction, age indeterminate.
Intraventricular conduction delay.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2144-5-21**] 1:52 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-19**], there is again some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
There is slight fullness of the pulmonary markings, raising the possibility of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
No evidence of pleural effusion or definite acute infiltrate.
ECHO [**2144-5-21**]: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-9-25**], the left ventricular severe systolic dysfunction appears more global.
Intraventricular conduction defect.
Possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Non-specific inferior and lateral ST-T wave changes.
Brief Hospital Course: 39 yo M with premature CAD s/p CABG, systolic CHF with EF 35%, s/p PM/ICD for VT who presents with VT and his ICD firing.
# fever: His fever to 102 [**Last Name (un) **] concerning for infection, there there was no objective source for his infection.
He did not have diarrhea while here.
His PA/LAT CXR showed no signs of infiltrate.
Suspect fevers were from viral infection, possibly pneumonia.
He was afebrile x 24 hours upon discharge.
# CAD/Ischemia: known premature CAD s/p CABG.
He was continued on asa, plavix, atorvastatin, bblocker, imdur at his home dosages (imdur and ace-i initially held because of his fever and concern for possible onset of sepsis).
His ACE-I was decreased to 20mg qday because of SBP in the 90s intermittently with the new regimen.
# Chronic Systolic heart failure: known systolic dysfunction with LVEF 35% on ECHO [**9-17**].
His lasix was initially held because of his febrile presentation, but it was restarted at his home dose upon discharge.
# dyslipidemia: TG were over 1200 on last admission.
# DM: no known diabetes.
# chronic pain: discharged on home dose of percocet and oxycontin.
# Prophylaxis: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home regimen .
Diazepam 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for anxiety.
Disp:*90 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ventricular tachycardia .
Secondary: -chronic systolic CHF -Premature CAD s/p CABG, [**2142-3-7**], anatomy as follows: LIMA->LAD, SVG->Diagonal, SVG->Posterolateral branch of RCA s/p multiple RCA stents c/b restenoses, brachytherapy -Pacemaker/ICD, in [**11-12**], for cardiomyopathy and VT -dyslipidemia -GERD -h/o drug seeking behavior -chronic back pain -Anxiety disorder -attention deficit disorder   Discharge Condition: good, stable   Discharge Instructions: You were seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for ICD firing for ventricular tachycardia.
You were also treated for possible pneumonia because of your fever when you were admitted.
There was no pneumonia by repeat chest xray, so the antibiotic was stopped.
Your urine was negative for infection and blood cultures have been negative thus far.
You should call your primary care provider or report to the emergency department if you feel worsening shortness of breath, fever, cough, or body/joint aches.
You should call your cardiologist or your primary care provider or return to the emergency department if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, palpitations, shocking from your ICD, loss of consciousness, cough, body aches, fever/chills greater than 100.5 degrees F, or any other symptoms that concern you.
