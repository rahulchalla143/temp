On the day of admission she complained of generalized headache, but no nausea or vomiting.
Later that day, she was found down by relatives (unwitnessed event) and she was taken to Good [**Hospital 39888**] Medical Center and found to have SAH on CT head.

No spontaneous movement but withdraws to noxious stimuli in all extremities.
CT head demonstrates extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and ventricular dilatation.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates a posterior communicating artery aneurysm with some irregularity of the surface pointing posteriorly and slightly inferiorly.
No other intracranial aneurysms are seen.
No abnormalities on somewhat limited CT angiography of the neck.
New placement of an intraventricular drain from a right frontal approach with the size of the ventricles appearing minimally changed from the most recent comparison.
Redemonstration of extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage  CAROTID/CEREBRAL UNILAT [**2186-10-28**] Successful coiling of left supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm.
No additional aneurysm noted on the left internal carotid artery  CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST [**2186-10-31**] 1.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
Metallic artifact limits assessment of potential vasospasm or new hemorrhage of nearby structures.
Stable areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the bilateral frontal lobes and within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
There were no epileptiform features noted on these files.
Routine sampling showed a background that was moderately encephalopathic with mixed theta and delta frequencies and occasional bursts of generalized high voltage delta slowing.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures on this recording.
EEG [**2186-11-7**] This telemetry captured one pushbutton activation which was not associated with any epileptiform features.
Routine sampling continued to show a generally slow and disorganized background consisting of mixed theta and delta frequencies consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
There were no epileptiform  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2186-11-8**] 1.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring s/p EVD placement in OR and then had a coiling of a L ICA aneurysm.
Her head CT was negative however her sputum then grew out Pseudomonas and was started on appropriate treatment.
CTAs were negative for vasospasm.
She was trached and PEG'd, She was found to have possible seizure activity and an EEG confirmed this.
Her clinical exam however was poor although CTAs continued to be negative for vasospasm and subsequent EEGs showed no seizures and Dilantin was eventually weaned off.
Due to her poor neurological status and poor progress a family meeting was conducted however family wanted to continue treatment.
Fever is thought to be attributed to PNA.
On [**11-10**] she had episodes of tachypnea although her CXR was improved, sputum still has gram neg rods/psuedomonas for which she is being treated with Cefepine and Cipro which ends on [**11-18**].
Additionally her LENIs were negative and  ABG showed no hypoxemia.
