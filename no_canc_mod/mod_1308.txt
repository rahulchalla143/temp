Admission Date:  [**2163-3-7**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2108-5-28**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine - [**Doctor Last Name **]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoxic respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54 year old white male with a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus, hypertension and atrial fibrillation who presented to the Emergency Department complaining of dyspnea and weakness.
He had recently been hospitalized from [**2-23**] through [**3-2**] for bleeding complication secondary to a liver biopsy.
Additionally from [**2-4**] to [**2-7**] he had been admitted for dyspnea and recurrent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolus.
The patient's first admission this year with multiple pulmonary embolus were diagnosed by computed tomographic angiography in both lungs in upper and lower lobes.
An incident finding on computerized tomography scan noted a hepatic nodule which was found during the hospitalization and further imaging was worrisome lesion of the liver and biopsy was arranged.
The patient suffered a hematocrit drop from 38 to 28 and hepatic subscapular hematoma presented on [**2-6**] with right-sided scapular shoulder pain.
On [**2163-2-25**], the patient went to IR where right hepatic artery branch was noted to be bleeding and embolized subsequently.
On the morning of admission the patient could not walk six feet without dyspnea and had severe fatigue.
The patient did not complain of chest pain or palpitations, fevers, chills, headache, twitching or paresthesias.
The patient then became bradycardiac with a heartrate in the 40s with thready peripheral pulses increased hypoxia and nonresponsive.
Electrocardiogram changes without acute ST elevations, sinus tachycardia with poor R wave progression.
Left side, very depressed left ventricular function and no blood in the peritoneum.
In the Catheterization Laboratory, right heart catheterization revealed a pulmonary artery pressure of 49/17, right ventricular 49/15, wedge of approximately 28 and minimal flow to the left lower lobe with some filling in the left upper lobe.
Coronary angiography revealed no significant disease.
Left dominant, mild left main, 50% left anterior descending and minimal luminal irregularities.
Because of the previous history of pulmonary embolisms in the past, surgical embolectomy was not a favorable option.
Atrial fibrillation since [**2162-9-25**]; 3.
Obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP at home; 5.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, anicteric sclera, no conjunctival hemorrhage, no jugulovenous distension appreciated.
Lungs, coarse bilateral, no wheezing crackles.
No ecchymosis of the groin or abdomen.
Extremities, cool, clammy in Emergency Department, improved on vital signs, no petechiae or ecchymosis.
AST 37, ALT 29, alkaline phosphatase 67, bilirubin .7, amylase 56, lipase 50, sodium 138, potassium 5.7, chloride 102, bicarbonate 25, BUN 35, creatinine 1.5, glucose 117, homocysteine was 13.7, anticardiolipin IgM was 27, IgG 6.5, Factor V 105, no lupus anticoagulant tested.
Chest x-ray, endotracheal tube, approximate 5 cm above [**Last Name (un) 8164**], poor volumes, high vascularization, no effusions ?
right middle lobe infiltrate versus atelectasis.
Electrocardiogram, sinus with a rate of 119, QRS 114, QTC 463, poor R wave progression, no ST elevations.
The patient also had a transesophageal echocardiogram done on [**2163-3-7**] in the Catheterization Laboratory with an left ventricular ejection fraction of 25-30%, severe left ventricular, hypokinesis globally 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, right ventricle dilated and function-depressed, no effusions.
6 based on the PTT values.
Initially it was hard to get the patient regulated to the PTT of 70 to 90, possibly due to his decreased clot.
Chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly with possible mild congestive heart failure.
Cardiovascular - The patient was transferred to the floor on Diltiazem, Amiodarone, Univasc, Lopressor for his cardiac function.
The patient had an echocardiogram done on [**2163-3-15**] which showed left ventricular cavity to be severely dilated with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis and left ventricular systolic function severely depressed.
It was also noted the right ventricular cavity was mildly dilated and 1+ mitral regurgitation and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation were noted.
Renal - The patient was noted to have an increase in creatinine that continued to rise.
The patient's creatinine with a baseline of 1.2 and 1.4 over the last admission was noted to be rising with a steady increase into the upper 2s and 3.
It was noted that the patient did have severe congestive heart failure which would possibly lead to the creatinine.
It was determined not to hydrate the patient as the patient also started developing extreme lower extremity edema and increase in abdominal girth.
Also it was not prudent to give the patient Lasix secondary to his increased creatinine.
The patient will be a candidate for an ACE inhibitor and possibly diuretics but this was held until the creatinine started to go down to baseline.
Gastrointestinal - The patient had several bouts of diarrhea which resolved on their own.
The patient was placed on Protonix for prophylaxis.
