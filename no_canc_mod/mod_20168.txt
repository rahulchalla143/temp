Decreased urine output.
[**Name (NI) **] also reports intermittent word finding difficulty, and dropping things x 1 day.
No recent med changes.
Patient was noted to be in acute renal failure and hyperkalemic with a BUN/cr of 153/16.
In the ED at OSH, he was also noted to have multiple "mult.
These were described as "tic-like," without LOC or confusion.
S/p neuro eval in ED who felt that neuro complaints were [**1-5**] encephalopathy due to metabolic derangements.

There is no evidence of hydronephrosis on either side.

-No evidence of hydronephrosis.
[**2176-1-27**] Portable CXR- Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates marked interval improvement in previously seen right-sided pleural effusion.
The right internal jugular central venous catheter is no longer present.
There is mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
No consolidation is evident.
Assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma is slightly limited by respiratory motion.
IMPRESSION: Near-complete resolution of previously seen right-sided pleural effusion with mild persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle .
Brief Hospital Course: 79yo male with hx of prior contrast nephropathy, s/p subtotal colectomy and ileostomy who presented with ARF with Cr to 16.5 which appeared to be pre-renal secondary to gastroenteritis with increased ostomy output and decreased PO fluid intake.
Of note, at OSH he also had some ?
Course on medicine floor: We continued his IVF @ 200/hr, he has had good UOP, no longer having increased output through ostomy, and tolerating PO.
He had elevated Na level with persistently low bicarb, changed IVF to free water with bicarb.
Pt put on course of Cipro for urinary tract infection.
Hyponatremia resolved with fluids, diarrhea resolved, renal failure quickly responded to fluids with creatinine peak at ~16.5, at 2.3 at discharge.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Likely prerenal in setting of hypovolemia due to diarrhea/increased ostomy output.
No signs of volume overload.
Na elevated secondary to aggressive re-hydration with NS.
Low bicarbonate from renal failure and rapid volume expansion.
Renal function continued to improve, with adequate urine output.
He did not meet objective criteria for hemodialysis while inpatient.
# WEAKNESS/WORD FINDING DIFFICULTY: Questioned encephalopathy secondary to uremia.
Per neuro, felt changes in mental status related to underlying metabolic derangement.
Corrected underlying metabolic abnormalities.
No seizure activity or focal neurological deficits in house.
Neuro felt patient stable for discharge with resolution of symptoms as uremia resolved.
# DIARRHEA: Suspected viral gastroenteritis.
Large amount of fluid loss in stool leading to subsequent hypovolemia, acute renal failure.
Pt advised to keep hydrated, and return to the ED if he experiences increasing ostomy output.
# PANCREATIC DYSFUNCTION: Elevated pancreatic enzymes, trending down.
No complaints of abdominal pain.
# UTI: On admission.
Enalapril and HCTZ to be restarted by PCP as per fluid status and renal function.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: -h/o acute renal failure [**1-5**] contrast nephropathy, since resolved -h/o C diff colitis s/p subtotal colectomy [**2172**]: admission c/b acute MI, failure to wean requiring trach/PEG; s/p ileostomy -SDH [**2172**] s/p drainage -HTN -COPD -h/o pseudomonas pneumonia -h/o pseudomonas urinary tract infection -h/o discitis -s/p appy   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with elevated potassium and creatinine.
Acute renal failure likely in the setting of a gastroenteritis with diarrhea and severe fluid loss.
You were also started on a antibiotic Cipro for a urinary tract infection.
Call PCP or return to the ED if you experience confusion, diarrhea, fainting, fevers, chills, chest pain, decrease urine output, increased swelling in your extremities, shortness of breath.
