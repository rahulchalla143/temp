Microbiology: - [**7-16**] Stool C-diff: Negative - [**7-9**] MRSA screen: Negative - [**7-7**] Urine culture: Negative - [**7-6**] R arm abscess: Sparse pansensitive S. Aureus, K. Pneumoniae - [**7-2**] Blood culture: Negative - [**6-29**] Blood culture: E. Coli .
Radiology: Renal US [**6-29**]:  Limited examination with no evidence of gross hydronephrosis.
Single pelvic kidney, which demonstrates a lobular contour with multiple hypodense an mild hyperdense lesions with no definite evidence of hydronephrosis.
The ureter is not well seen; however, there is no definite obstructing calculus.
Punctate foci of calcification within the pelvic kidney can represent non-obstructive calculi or paranchymal calcification.
Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia and/or aspiration.
Absent uterus, urinary bladder reconstruction, right colostomy.
Multiple congenital osseous abnormalities and caudal regression with sacral meningocele or myelomeningocele.
CT Head [**6-30**]:  No acute intracranial process.
No evidence of thoracic, abdominal pelvic abscess formation.
Residual small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Unchanged single left pelvic kidney with a lobular contour and multiple hypodense lesions, likely cysts.
No evidence of abscess formation or hydronephrosis.
Unchanged urinary bladder reconstruction, urostomy, and right ileostomy.
MRA Head [**7-1**]: There is evidence of vascular flow in both internal carotids, however both middle cerebral arteries appears thin, given the clinical history vasospasm cannot be completely excluded, correlation with followup MRI or CTA are recommended if clinically warranted.
No evidence of acute ischemic changes are demonstrated on the diffusion-weighted sequences.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**7-1**]: Tethered cord with myelomeningocele as described above, single pelvic kidney and absence of the uterus.
There is no evidence of epidural abscess formation.
Right UE US [**7-6**]: Superficial abscess corresponding to the area of clinical concern.
CT Head [**7-6**]:  No acute intracranial process.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**7-13**]: No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction.
On EEG, rhythmic sharp wave activity was seen in a widespread bilateral distribution varying from a three per second up to six to seven per second frequency.
After administration of intravenous lorazepam on the afternoon of [**2192-7-9**], the electrographic status epilepticus resolved and an underlying slow and disorganized background in the theta frequency range suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy was seen.
Brief periods of recurrence of higher amplitude widespread bilateral rhythmic sharp activity were seen in the early morning hours of [**2192-7-10**], but these did not persist.
EEG [**7-10**] to [**7-15**]: These exams illustrated interval improvement from EEG on [**7-9**] with decreased evidence for seizure activities.
The last exam report are as listed here: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
However, it captured numerous second periods of generalized rhythmic activity with a frequency of 5 Hz and embedded sharp waves that are suggestive of seizure activity; however, with no clear clinical correlate.
There were also a few sharp waves seen in the right central area suggestive of increased cortical irritability in that region.
The background activity was, at times, mixed with slower frequencies of waveforms suggestive of a mild encephalopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 9449**] is a 30 year old female with history of hepatitis C, polysubstance abuse, chronic renal insufficiency, cloacal extrophy s/p bladder augmentation with neoureter reconstruction with small bowel who presents with dyspnea, found to have significant acidosis and acute on chronic renal failure with hypokalemia.
#) Acidosis: The patient presented initially with significant metabolic acidosis with pH 7.18 at [**Hospital3 6592**], pCO2 8, and pO2 of 150.
The patient has a history of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis thought to be secondary to her ileal bladder augmentation and wasting of bicarbonate.
However, on admission she also had a gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to her renal failure and uremia.
#) Hypokalemia: The patient also had severe hypokalemia, thus far has received 80 mEq in intravenous fluids.
GI (eg vomiting and diarrhea) is likely part of etiology of hypokalemia.
She also has a history of hypokalemia based on her records from [**Hospital3 **] and may not have been repleting it properly prior to hospitalization.
#) Bacteremia: The patient started growing out E. Coli in [**1-21**] blood culture bottles resistant to bactrim, ampicillin and cipro, and on initial presentation also had a profound leukocytosis.
Source of her infection was likely a urinary tract infection, however a urine sample proved difficult to obtain.
#) Seizure: On MICU day 3 [**2192-7-1**], the patient had two episodes of tonic/clonic seizures.
A CT of her head showed no evidence of acute bleed and an MRI was obtained that showed evidence of a meningomyelocele at the L5 region but no evidence of temporal lobe enhancement.
As such, the patient could not be ruled out for meningitis, however a urine tox screen came back positive for cocaine.
Further history provided by the patient's mother indicated that the patient has had similar episodes in the past, and was in the setting of substance abuse and withdrawal.
An EEG was obtained, which showed no further seizure activity and the patient was extubated without difficulty.
#) Acute on chronic kidney injury: Baseline renal function per notes appears to be around 1.6, likely in part due to congenital malformation, which includes a solitary pelvic kidney.
Renal ultrasound was negative for hydronephrosis, and the patient was able to urinate, albeit was incontinent of urine.
B12 and folate were normal, and iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
#) Right arm hematoma: The patient was noted to have a large bump on her right arm early in her MICU course.
The area felt fluctuant but had no erythema or warmth.
However, on MICU day 6, the patient was complaining of worsening pain and the area appeared hot and red.
An ultrasound of the area to look for abscess was ordered and was performed after transfer to the medicine floor.
# Altered mental status.
MMSE at that time was notable for deficits in serial 7s and "WORLD" backwards as well as with execution of multi-step task.
The following morning, she was noted to have an episode of agitation (pushing staff away, yelling) associated with anisocoria.
She was evaluated by neurology service who noted no focal deficits.
STAT head CT was negative, and 20-minute EEG study showed non-specific findings suggestive of encephalitis.
Mental status seemed to improve somewhat over the weekend, but on [**2192-7-9**] she was observed to be non-verbal, refusing medications, and not following most commands.
No focal neurologic deficits at that time.
She developed reactive sinus tachycardia to 140s, and was transferred to the MICU on neurology recommendation for closer observation overnight.
# Electrolyte imbalances, acute-on-chronic renal failure.
# Right arm abscess.
Culture grew MSSA and Klebsiella spp.
# Urinary retention.
She was noted to have urine leaking out of her fistula, and bladder scan showed > 800 cc.
Urology recommendations were for ostomy bag fitted to fistula site (as patient was exhibiting evidence of skin irritation and continued to leak urine from this site) as well as for follow up with pediatric urologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital3 1810**] (for his greater familiarity with congenital anomalies such as this patient has).
She again became non-responsive at 3:55pm (opened eyes to voice but did not otherwise respond).
Neurology felt like these events were consistent with a seizure (most likely secondary to low phenytoin level).
Her mental status was much improved on [**7-10**] AM and patient did not have any further events while here.
She did develop tachycardia to 130s  (asymptomatic, sitting up in bed).
Given that she was seizure-free and mentating well, patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 11 (medicine/neuro floor) on [**7-10**].
#) Seizure: Patient had multiple push button activations with staring spells when she was non-verbal or spoke with two word answers but followed command.
EEGs continued to show epileptiform activity but this was improved from before.
Patient had been started on treatment in the MICU for presumed meningitis but this was discontinued after 12 days of therapy given compromised renal function.
A VBG showed:  7.26/42/40/20 consistent with poorly compensated metabolic acidosis.
#) Abdominal Pain: Prior to discharge, patient developed abdominal pain.
On the day of discharge, patient no longer had abdominal pain.
#) Hypokalemia: The patient has had problems with recurrent hypokalemia during her admission.
#) Acute on chronic kidney injury: Baseline renal function per notes appears to be around 1.6, likely in part due to congenital malformation, which includes a solitary pelvic kidney.
#) Anemia:  She was started on Epoietin Alfa on [**7-15**] and discharged on weekly Epo to be administered by her mother, who is a nurse.
#) History of substance abuse:  Her urine toxicology was only positive for methadone.
#) Anxiety: She had multiple episodes of anxiety, which would often prompt her to behave erratically and act out.
She was started on sertraline and received prn doses of ativan for acute anxiety while here.
#) Sinus tachycardia/TFTs: Patient had persistent sinus tachycardia.
It was unclear if it might be due to anxiety, hypovolemia, or increased adrenergic discharge given acute illness.
TFTs showed an elevated TSH at 24 with a normal free T4.
