Able to relate history without difficulty.
There were no paraphasic errors.
was able to name both high and low frequency objects.
There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.

On discharge: patient is pleasant, [**Location (un) 1131**] a book, He is AOx3, PERRL, EOM intact face is symmetric, mild broca's aphasia, MAEs with good strenght, no drift, sensory intact, incision is c/d/i (staples removed [**1-2**]).
9-mm left hemispheric subdural hematoma with trace supratentorial extension and minimal if any rightward shift.
No intra-axial hemorrhage.
Benign-appearing right frontal bone reticular lucent lesion could potentially represent a hemangioma.
[**12-16**] CTA Head: IMPRESSION: Unchanged left hemispheric subdural hematoma, measuring approximately 9 mm in thickening with trace of blood along the left tentorium.
The vascular images, demonstrate an outpouching adjacent to the left transverse sinus, possibly consistent with a venous aneurysm, measuring approximately 5.6 x 7.0 mm as described above.
Grossly no arterial aneurysms larger than 3 mm in size are detected; however, this study is limited due to lack of 3D reconstructions.
[**12-17**] Cerebral Angio- which failed to reveal a source of her left subdural hematoma.
[**12-17**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Known left-sided subdural hematoma with interval redistribution of blood products.
No significant shift of midline structures.
A small mixed attenuation focsu in the right parietal bone ( se 2, im 16), unchanged and needs attention on f/u- a hemantioma or a focal lesion related to other etiology.
Stable appearance of left subdural hematoma without new development of mass effect or increased hemorrhage.
Stable subdural collections overlying both convexities with right and left maximal thickness of 5 or 9 mm.
While there is predominantly hygroma on the right side with some traces of blood, the left subdural collection containts largely blood products of early subacute origin.
Mass effect is mild and limited to effacement of the sulci.
No evidence of vascular malformation, underlying space-occupying lesion, or infarct.
Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2186-12-19**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal extended routine EEG because of occasional low amplitude left temporal sharp waves indicative of a potential epileptogenic focus in this region.
In addition, there was intermittent slowing of background over the left temporal region consistent with an underlying subcortical dysfunction in this region.
Also, there were intermittent brief periods of generalized slowing of background indicative of a midline cerebral dysfunction.
Background otherwise showed a posterior dominant alpha rhythm.
No electrographic seizures were present.
No marked change in size or mass effect exerted by the left subacute frontoparietal subdural hematoma.
No new major hemorrhage is seen.
Assessment for subtle cerebral edema and subtle new hemorrhage can be limited given the lower resolution of portable study.
Left temporal most active, right temporal second, and left central also noted.
EEG [**12-23**] - This is an abnormal continuous ICU video EEG due to prolonged periods of background slowing most likely representing a moderate encephalopathy.
Left temporal most active, right temporal second, and left central also noted representing areas of cortical irritability.
There were four prolonged periods of intermittent runs of sharply contoured theta with some evolution to slower rhythm over time suspicious for subtle electrographic seizure-like phenomenon.
On video, there was no clinical seizure-like correlation during these runs.
[**12-23**]  Ct head - Interval craniotomy with evacuation of left subdural hematoma.
No DVT in right or left lower extremities  [**12-25**] CT Head 1.
Increased mass effect from operative site causing new rightward shift of subfalcine herniation and effacement of left lateral ventricle.
No new hemorrhage identified.
[**12-26**] CT Head  Stable appearance of partially evacuated acute-on-chronic left subdural hematoma, with residual pneumocephalus.
Continued 8-mm rightward subfalcine herniation, early left uncal herniation, and 5-mm rightward shift.
Mild diffuse cerebral edema.
[**12-28**] CT Head  Slight interval increase in transverse diameter of subdural fluid collection.
No evidence of new blood within the subdural space.
Interval slight increase of mass effect causing progression of the subfalcine herniation.
Stable prominence of left uncus in the suprasellar cistern.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 38513**] was admitted to the neurosurgery service, she underwent a CTA which was negative for underlying vascular lesion.
Given a lack of trauma in the patient's history on the morning on [**12-17**] patient underwent a formal diagnostic angiogram.
A lung lesion was noted on CXR and it was recommended that she follow up with her PCP.
On [**12-19**] she was neurologically stable and she stated that her headache pain was improved compared to admission.
She underwent a STAT head CT that showed diffuse edema and effacement of cortical sulci concerning for impending herniation.
She was transferred to the ICU, intubated, and had a left SC TLC which resulted in a Pneumothorax which required a chest tube.
Also, the small apical pneumothorax persists and has now width of about 1-1.5 cm.
No new abnormalities are seen.
The hyponatremia resolving and the serum sodium was 140.
CT scan showed increased left subdural hematoma with early subfalcine herniation.
Post-operative CT showed post operative changes with pneumocephalus.
On [**12-25**], Repeat CT demonstrated persistent cerebral edema with unchanged 5mm midline shift.
She was noted to have a clot in her right femoral artery which vascular surgery was consulted.
Her chest tube was placed to water seal which demonstrated no leak.
Post pull x-rays showed showed no PTX.
This showed increase in cerebral edema and midline shift.
On [**12-28**] the patient had intermittent episodes of aphasia with urinary incontinence x 1.
A CT scan showed slight increase in subdural fluid collection and mass effect.
She is tolerating POs and her pain is well controlled.
4. butalbital-acetaminophen-caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
6. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Cepacol Sore Throat 15-2.6 mg Lozenge Sig: One (1) lozengen Mucous membrane once a day as needed for throat irritation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Subdural Hematoma 11 mm wide nodule in the left lower lung Acute hyponatremia Cerebral edema Altered mental status Respiratory failure Left sided pneumothorax malnutrition Seizures Right Common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent with mild expressive aphasia Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.

Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
