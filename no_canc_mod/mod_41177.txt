There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 2.5 cm above the carina.
There is a nasogastric tube whose tip and side port are below the gastroesophageal junction.
Moderate pneumomediastinum and small bilateral pneumothoraces.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities, likely aspiration or atelectasis.
Bilateral supraclavicular soft tissue air.
No evidence of esophageal or tracheal injury on CT. 5.
Moderate to large amount of soft tissue gas, most pronounced in the R>L supraclavicular regions, along the sternocleidomastoid muscles of the neck, the upper neck prevertebral soft tissues and the partially seen mediastinum.
No large neck hematoma, and no fracture.
Echogenic renal parenchyma bilaterally, compatible with diffuse parenchymal disease.
Interval decrease in soft tissue gas involving mediastinum, bilateral supraclavicular regions, right sternocleidomastoid, and right masticator spaces.
New bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions, right slightly greater than left, incompletely imaged.
Interval decrease in pneumomediastinum and supraclavicular subcutaneous soft tissue air.
Slight interval decrease in size of bilateral small pleural effusions.

BARIUM SWALLOW [**2193-5-11**]: Swallows of thin barium in the frontal, lateral, and oblique positions show normal swallow function without evidence of leak.
The column of barium is seen extending through the esophagus to the stomach without evidence of leak in the esophagus.
There is no definite motility dysfunction.
There is no evidence of obstruction at the gastroesophageal junction or elsewhere in the upper GI tract.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pharyngeal or esophageal leak with persistent pneumomediastinum and soft tissue gas.
KUB [**2193-5-12**]: There is contrast material seen throughout the colon including the appendix.
There are few air-filled loops of small bowel, however, there is no free intra-abdominal gas.
No focal liver lesion is identified.
No biliary dilatation is seen and the common duct measures 0.4 cm.
No hydronephrosis is seen on limited views of the kidneys.
No ascites is seen in the abdomen.
A small right and left pleural effusion is noted.
No gallstones and no biliary dilatation.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
CXR [**2193-5-15**]: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval resolution of pulmonary edema from the mid and upper lung field when compared to the study from three days ago.
There are persistent bilateral lower lung opacities representing residual edema and/or atelectasis.
Small pleural effusions are also present.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no evidence of residual pneumomediastinum.
Interval improvement in pulmonary edema with some persistence in the bilateral lung bases.

CXR [**2193-5-20**]: Lung volumes remain quite low and there is substantial bibasilar atelectasis which has not cleared over several days.
Mild vascular congestion is new, small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.
Small nodular opacities in the lungs are probably vessels on end and hazy opacification in the lower lungs is probably mild pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are slightly larger today than on [**5-15**].
No pneumothorax.

#OVERDOSE: Patient was brought to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] hospital ED where he was found to be febrile to 105, agitated, and delirious with elevated LFTs.
He was intubated in setting of airway protection and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and empirically started on n-acetylcysteine (NAC)as well as vancomycin/ceftriaxone due to fever and leukocytosis to 35 with bandemia.
Per the initial toxicology recs, patient most likely experienced serotonin syndrome as a result of his ingestion (Coricidin contains dextromethorphan, chlorpheniramine, +/- acetaminophen).
The patient's urine tox screen was also positive for cocaine and opiates, but his serum tox screen was negative for acetaminophen.
#RHABDOMYOLYSIS: The patient's rhabdomyolysis was likely due to hyperthermia and his toxic ingestion.
He received aggressive LR fluid hydration in the setting of hyperchloremia and hypernatremia.
#TRANSAMINITIS: The patient had a transaminitis on admission initially concerning for ischemia or tylenol use and was started on NAC treatment, though these were rapidly elminated from the differential.
His transaminitis were felt to be secondary to rhabdomyolysis and began to improve over the course of his stay and with the initiation of dialysis.
There was no evidence of hepatologic pathology, hepatitis serologies were sent and were negative.
Per renal consult's recs, LR was discontinued briefly because of transient hyperkalemia and the patient was switched to 1/2 NS and repleted with more bicarb.
The patient was once more switched back to LR because of recurrent hyperchloremia and hypernatremia.
Renal recommended a trial of Lasix 150 mg to help diuresis him, given his volume overload and anuria but he was not responsive.
Patient continued to develop a worsening acidosis with compensatory tachypnea.
A temporary dialysis catheter was placed by IR on [**5-13**] and the patient was started on dialysis with rapid correction in his acidosis and overall clinical status.
Of note, Hepatitis B and C serologies suggestive no history of hepatitis C and immunity to Hepatitis B.
ENT noted some bruising of his left lateral laryngeal wall (possible site of tear) and thought that the pneumomediastinum was likely [**1-3**] a traumatic intubation prior to admission at the OSH followed by bagging, causing air to track down his mediastinum.
His leukocytosis was likely [**1-3**] stress demargination.
Patient was treated with Unasyn for 7 day course as prophylaxis for mediastinitis.
He was started on hydroxazine 25 mg Q6H PRN for anxiety.
#HYPERTENSION: On admission, the patient was transiently hypertensive to the 170s, felt to be secondary to volume overload and discomfort.
Renal has been performing ultra filtration in an effort to decrease intravascular volume and started on labetalol 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for further control.
As patient did not have existing hypertension prior to his toxic insult he was not felt to be at high risk for developing end organ damage and permissive blood pressures to the 160s were felt resonable as he was likely to further improve with ongoing dialysis.
He did had a NCHCT to evaluate for evidence of PRES syndrome given his nausea and vomitting that developed late in his hospitalization, but there was no radiographic evidence of demylenation.
His nausea and headache resolved with further dialysis treatments.
NAUSEA/ABDOMINAL PAIN: On [**2193-5-18**] the patient developed nasuea with vomitting, given his persistent hypertension a central cause was explored and no radiographic evidence of PRES syndrome was identified.
The patient's symptoms were felt to be related to uremia secondary to 48 hours without dialysis.
It was also thought around [**2193-5-18**] that the patient could have developed pancreatitis given elevated lipase in setting of Carbamazepine re-initiation.
His abdominal symptoms and nausea resolved with conservative measurements.
Artificial Tear Ointment 1 Appl BOTH EYES QID:PRN dry eyes 7.
Labetalol 300 mg PO BID   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - acute oliguric renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis - mood disorder NOS with suicide attempt - rhabdomyolysis - pancreatitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after overdosing on cough syrup in an attempt to kill yourself.
You also had pneumomediastinum from a traumatic intubation, which has resolved.
We also think that you developed briefly pancreatitis from your home medication (tegretol), which you should not take any more.
