He was asymptomatic and hymodynamically stable.
He had a noraml CXR, was ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes.
He denies CP, SOB, N/V, diaphoresis with these episodes.
He has had stable anginal pain in past but has not had it during these episodes.
ROS: no history of lung disease, no cough, has GERD symptomes, no abdominal pain, no nausea, no vomiting, no constipation, no diarrhea, no bleeding (melena, hematochezia), no h/o liver disease, has history of joint pain/arthritis, no claudication.
Family History: Father lived to [**Age over 90 **] years old of diabetes complications.
Physical Exam: VITALS: T 97.8  HR 60  BP 189/56 RR 20 Sat 96  Pain 0/10 GENERAL:  well developed, older male in NAD.
SKIN: chronic venous stasis changes of lower legs HEAD: NC/AT EARS: Normal external structure EYES: EOMI, Anicteric, PERRL NOSE: Non deviated septum THROAT: tongue midline, upper dentures NECK: No stiffness, No masses, No LAD, Palpable carotid pulses, soft left bruits, no tracheal deviation CHEST: no supraclavicular or axillary LAD, Lungs Clear to Asculation, No Wheezes/Rhonchi/Crackles HEART: RRR, No Murmurs/Gallops/Rubs ABDOMEN: Mildly Obese, No scars, NABS, mildly Distended, Soft, No organomegaly, No masses, No guarding, No rebound EXT: No clubbing/cyanosis/edema.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal, anterior and apical hypokinesis.
The inferior wall also appears mildly hypokinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
A paravalvular aortic valve leak is probably present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No valvular vegetations seen but cannot exclude opn the basis of this study.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mechanical aortic prosthesis with normal gradients but mild paravalvular regurgitation.
Echo [**2144-9-29**]: Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
The interatrial septum is aneurysmal, but no atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm, non-mobile) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta and simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Interatrial septal aneurysm.
No vegetations or abscess identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 y/o male with HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, S/P AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical Valve, [**2132**], on coumadin) presented with dizziness/lightheadedness to [**Hospital3 3583**] and found to have complete heart block.
Had temporary pacing wire placed and then transferred for pacememker and possible defibrilator.
He has a history of anginal symptomes and is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 47696**] at [**Hospital3 3583**].
HTN: His blood pressure was elevated at times during his hospital stay.
Left lower extremity pain:  Pt notes increased left "calf" pain when he walks.
Palpable L PT and warm, so not at risk for limb-threatening ischemia.
