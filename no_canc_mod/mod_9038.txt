HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year-old gentleman with no known history of coronary artery disease who presented to an outside hospital complaining of substernal chest pain.
The pain began at 10:00 a.m. and was substernal without radiation described as a dull ache different from the usual GERD.
The patient preceeded to the local Emergency Room given the persistent and worsening pain at 10:30 a.m.  At the outside hospital Emergency Department the patient also complained of diaphoresis and now of [**9-28**] chest pain.
An electrocardiogram revealed ST elevation and peaked T waves.
The patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin, morphine, Lopressor, aspirin and the pain decreased to [**5-29**], but never went away completely.
Catheterization revealed that right dominant system normal, normal LMCA, LCX with mild disease, right coronary artery with 40% mid and 50% posterior descending coronary artery stenosis, left anterior descending coronary artery with 70% stenosis at the origin and 99% stenosis due to thrombotic occlusion distally with slow TIMI two flow.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Right groin there is an arterial venous sheath in place.
No bruit or hematoma.
Electrocardiogram at outside hospital showed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 70, normal intervals, right axis, ST elevation in V1 through V4, peaked T waves in V1 through V4 and flat Ts.
After stent placement at [**Hospital1 69**] electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of78, normal intervals, normal axis, ST elevation in V2 through V4 is still present, but decreased and there is a Q wave in V3 of questionable significance and normal T waves.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Mild hypercholesterolemia.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident or diabetes mellitus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 49 year-old gentleman with no prior history of coronary artery disease who presented to an outside hospital with substernal chest pain and diaphoresis and anterior ST elevation on electrocardiogram consistent with an anterior myocardial infarction and was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for catheterization, which revealed left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis 70% at the origin and 99% mid distally, now status post stent of the left anterior descending coronary artery at the origin and distally.
Coronary artery disease, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is status post anterior myocardial infarction and stenting of the left anterior descending coronary artery times two.
An echocardiogram showed an EF of 30% with akinesis at the inferior wall and hypokinesis V3 and septal inferior wall.
The patient also was started on heparin for anticoagulation due to akinesis and decreased EF.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a few runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during the 24 hours after the anterior myocardial infarction and catheterization.
He was randomized to the cooling arm of the cool myocardial infarction protocol trial.
