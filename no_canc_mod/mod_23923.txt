Has been having gas/intermittent diarrhea on/off for weeks.
No abdominal pain/vomiting.
Underwent CT scan of his abdomen which showed air in the biliary tree so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Surgical ICU for further management.
Had a right upper quadrant ultrasound that showed concern for possible air vs. stone in the gall bladder, and possible air in the left lobe of the liver.
These findings were most concerning for biliary enteric fistula vs. emphysematous cholecystitis, with emphysematous cholecystitis being less likely base on imaging.
Was still having fevers on [**10-23**].
After ERCP consult, it was recommended that he undergo ERCP for further evaluation, so he was transfered to [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU to facilitate his procedure and for further monitoring on [**10-24**].
Underwent ERCP on [**10-24**] with sphincterotomy, stone fragment extraction, no pus, no fistula.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course also remarkable for acute hypoxia, resp distress on [**10-24**] am.
Got lasix and nebs with some improvement.

UA [**10-24**] with 4wbc, few bacteria UCx negative .
OSH: blood cx [**10-22**]: 4 of 4 Klebsiella pneumonia Sensitive to all except ampicillin .
small 8mm AML upper pole L kidney .
There is extensive bilateral perihilar new interstitial prominence as well as newly developed left retrocardiac opacity that might be a progression of pre-demonstrated abnormality on [**2159-10-22**] radiograph suggesting worsening of infection in combination with pulmonary edema.
Followup of the patient after diuresis is recommended to evaluate the relationship between suspected infection and pulmonary edema changes.
There is no pneumothorax.
No focal consolidation identified.
There is moderate to severe mitral regurgitation - there is mild bileaflet prolapse.
There may be a partial flail of the posterior leaflet (images # 1 and 2).
The RV is mildly dilated/hypokinetic.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
RUQ U/S ([**10-22**]): wet read: gb collapsed with possible air (linear hyperechoic foci with dirty shadowing) although stone could have similar appearance- less likely given no stone on recent outside CT images.
possible air within left lobe of liver.
no bil dil.
DDx includes recent procedure or possible biliary enteric fistula.
emphysematous cholecystitis could also present with gb air, however there is no inflammatory changes/wall edema or gb distention.
No evidence of a biliary enteric fistula An air pneumogram was seen on the scout image.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification  A distal CBD filling defect consistent with a small stone was seen at the biliary tree.
The bile duct was clear at the end of the procedure (sphincterotomy, stone extraction) Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum Note that there was no pus in the bile duct - it is not clear that biliary sepsis is the cause of his recurrent fevers - consider other causes .
Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old male with h/o hypertension, DM on insulin, CKD IV, chronic dCHF who presented to OSH [**10-22**] with one day of fevers, CT scan concerning for pneumobilia so transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
ERCP done on [**10-24**] with CBD stone/sludge which was removed, but no pus or fistula as suggested on CT/US.
Found to have klebsiella bacteremia with unclear source but most likey biliary as the admission UA/CXR at OSH and here were unremarkable.
Had daily fevers until [**10-24**] am but has been afebrile since ERCP.
Subsequent blood cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] negative except 1 of 4 bottles on [**10-22**] in ER had CONS, deemed to be contaminant (esp given we had other bacteria isolated from OSH).
One other issue complicating hospital stay was that he initially recieved fluids given transient hypotension en route to [**Hospital1 18**] and ongoing fevers and concern for sepsis.
Then on [**10-24**] am, was wheezing and CXR/BNP c/w acute worsening CHF (Echo normal EF, mod-severe MR).
Renal was consulted given unclear etiology ([**Name (NI) 84518**] 55%, US neg, urine eos neg, I/Os positive balance, no contrast, no documented hypotension, no nephrotoxins).
They felt it may have been due to relative hypotension/hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis and restarting lisinopril and lasix (got his home PO dose lisinopril 5mg and lasix 80mg PO on [**10-26**] am before labs were drawn).
Given that his O2 sats were good, we did not resume his lasix on discharge and this can be done over the next few days per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1159**] if his creat remains stable.
PCP updated as well and [**Hospital 33857**] transfer to [**Hospital6 **] for IV Abx and short rehab stay.
no contrast recently.
no documented hypotension.
-Holding lasix/lisinopril per renal as they think relative hypotension in setting of sepsis -creat improved 2.8-->1.9 with holding lasix and lisinopril, will continue to hold and can resume as outpt -renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins .
Allergy to Midline: developed streaking along LUE midline so removed and PIV placed.
Klebsiella bacteremia/fevers: Given CT and US findings, initially concern for biliary source.
however, LFTs wnl, GB otw normal, and ERCP w/o evidence of pus or fistula.
will treat for 14days for bacteremia -will continue unasyn per sensitivites.
-f/u blood cx, NTD here (except CONS) -note, repeated CXR after diuresis, no infiltrate -CIS, last temp [**10-24**] am .
has h/o CONS endocarditis BUT since 1/4 bottles and we already have other source, this is likely a contaminant.
s/p lasix 80IV [**10-24**] and [**10-25**] with some improvement.
Choledocholithiasis: again as above, ERCP wtih small distal CBD stone, s/p sphincterotomy and sweep.
No pus or fistula seen.
per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has h/o cholecystitis but has deferred CCY in past.
Holding ACE-I, BPs ar acceptable and per renal, avoid hypotension in setting of recent bacteremia/sepsis.
likely due to acute illness and dilutional.
Also CKD component -follow trend .
high risk delirium -nonpharm measures -foley d/c'd -no narcotics/sedatives -PT following -reorient frequently -resumed home aricept and namenda .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 25759**] & Rehab Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Klebsiella bacteremia, likely biliary source Choledocholithiasis s/p ERCP ARF on CKD Acute on chronic diastolic CHF Mild delirium with baseline mild dementia CONS bacteremia 1/4 bottles, likely contaminant  Discharge Condition: STABLE  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fevers and were found to have bacteria (klebsiella) in your blood.
the source of this bacteria is likely from your gallbladder since your urine and ChestXray were okay on presentation.
You also had some kidney problems while here.
