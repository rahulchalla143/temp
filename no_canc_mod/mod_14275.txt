Past Medical History: hep C depression chronic low back pain right mca aneurysm sleep apnea pt denies HTN  Social History: no smoking / no etoh / currently recently seperated from wife / he is living with his mother.
Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: on discharge Pt is awake alert and oriented without focal neurological deficit.
Evaluate for acute changes.
Again demonstrated a moderate amount of hyperdense right extra-axial fluid, compatible with post-surgical changes, with small amount of pneumocephalus overlying the right as well as the left frontal lobes.
Since the prior study, there has been either no significant interval change or perhaps minimally decrease in size of the right extra-axial hyperdense collection.
There are no new foci of hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration, without evidence of hydrocephalus.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are aerated.
IMPRESSION: Status post right MCA aneurysm clipping, with right frontal post- operative subdural hematoma and areas of pneumocephalus, not significantly changed from the prior study.
TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient's family after explaining the risks, indications and alternative management.
Risks explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.
Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
Multiple oblique images and ___ images were performed.
IMPRESSION:  Excellent clipping of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm with no evidence of residual aneurysm.
The procedure was uneventful and the patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
he is tolerating PO/ ambulating independently and feels well enough to go home today - he is being discharged to home wihtout services to follow up in 4 weeks without imaging.
His incision is clean and dry with intact staples.
IT IS TO PREVENT SEIZURES .
