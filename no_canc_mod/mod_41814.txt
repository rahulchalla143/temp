Pt was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia and hypotension.
Hypoxia was attributed to multifactorial etiology of pulmonary edema from heart failure, pleural effusions and pneumonia.
He was persistently hypotensive, in part likely [**2-10**] hypovolemia, but mostly thought to be secondary to systolic heart failure.
Shortness of breath/cough: Given patient's history of aspiration event in the past with worrisome s+s eval and history of acutely worsening dyspnea, patient likely had another aspiration event.
Concern for aspiration pneumonia vs. aspiration pneumonitis.
HCAP and atypical pneumonia remain possibilities as well and were treated.
Discussion was held with the patient and family, and given the irreversibility of his heart failure and acute worsening of his condition, he was made CMO and expired 7 days after admission.
ARF: Patient with BUN/Cr suggestive of prerenal azotemia.
Possibly due to poor forward-flow in setting of CHF exacerbation.
