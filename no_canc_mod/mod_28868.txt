The patient is a 24 year old female status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy on [**2122-2-18**], at outside hospital who presented with jaundice and elevated total bilirubin level, ERCP performed at [**Hospital1 69**] demonstrating a single short stricture seen at the common hepatic duct, distal to the hilum.
There was moderate postobstructive dilation.
No acute distress.
CVS: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
On [**2122-2-24**], a HIDA scan was performed demonstrating likely persistent bile leakage.
On [**2122-2-24**], the patient had an ultrasound of her hypoechoic fluid collection in the gallbladder fossa measuring 65 x 31 x 32.
Fluid collection in the gallbladder fossa could not be accessed by ultrasound via submucosal approach.
On [**2122-2-25**], the patient had an ultrasound of the abdomen demonstrating patent hepatic venous and pleural venous system with flow in the appropriate direction.
There was no significant residual fluid seen in the gallbladder fossa after placement of a drainage catheter and no free fluid seen in the abdomen.
Left-sided intrahepatic biliary tree is not dilated.
The decreased hematocrit prompted a CT abdomen and pelvis to be obtained which demonstrated active bleeding from the anterior liver causing a large hematoma in the right upper quadrant with extension of the hematoma into the pelvis.
There was evidence of mass backed by the hematoma displacing the liver more centrally.
There was fluid around the tail of the pancreas which may be consistent with the patient's history of pancreatitis.
No significant fluid collection in the gallbladder fossa.
There is a small left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
Urgent angiogram was performed of the liver demonstrating superselective angiogram of the hepatic arteries demonstrating an area of acute extravasation in the anterior segment of the right lobe of the liver.
There was successful coiling of the bleeding vessel using two 0.018/0.5 cm straight coils.
On [**2122-3-3**], the patient had a CT abdomen and pelvis demonstrating interval development of a large geographic area of hypodensity in the right hepatic lobe.
Given the recent hepatic artery embolization, this is reasonable for hepatic necrosis or developing abscess.
Parenchymal hematoma is also less likely.
There is no evidence of active contrast extravasation.
Decrease in the amount of perihepatic abdominal and pelvic fluid.
There was a small left pleural effusion.
There was moderate postobstructive dilatation.
Left intrahepatic ductal system was dilated as well as compared to the branches seen in the right system.
The forceful injection was performed and the patient was rotated for optimal visualization, appeared we were in fact viewing both a nondilated right and a moderately dilated left system.
No biliary leak was seen.
AST was 132, ALT 279, alkaline phosphatase 492, total bilirubin 1.9 which had decreased significantly.
On [**2122-3-16**], the patient went to the OR for an end to side roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy over a 5 French feeding tube; evacuation of subcapsular hematoma performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Postoperatively, the patient had an epidural for pain control.
There were no complications.
There is dilation of the left hepatic duct as noted, unchanged compared to the ERCP on [**2122-3-9**].
On [**2122-3-26**], CT abdomen and pelvis was performed because of persistent nausea and vomiting which demonstrated no evidence of bowel obstruction or other acute gastrointestinal pathology.
Decrease in size of intrahepatic subcapsular collection.
There was a 5.9 x 4.6 x 3.4 cm focus in the gallbladder fossa of low attenuation mixed with air.
So the patient was receiving Keflex for a small area of her incision that was possible infection.
On [**2122-3-27**], the patient was on no antibiotics.
She was afebrile and vital signs were stable.
The patient is to call transplant surgery immediately at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 64549**] if any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, increased abdominal pain, any redness around her PTC catheter which was capped.
[**2122-2-26**], unsuccessful attempted right sided     percutaneous transhepatic angiography despite multiple     attempts.
[**2122-2-27**], superselective angiogram.
[**2122-3-16**], end to side roux-en-y     hepaticojejunostomy over a 5 French feeding tube and     evacuation of subcapsular hematoma.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  The patient is a 24 year old female with hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism 2 years ago, with bile duct injury/obstruction, status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Secondary diagnoses subcapsular hematoma of the liver, hypertension.
