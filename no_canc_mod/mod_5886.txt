Admission Date:  [**2120-5-31**]     Discharge Date:  [**2120-6-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2071-6-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  ORTHOPEDIC SPINE DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  T1 lateral mass fracture and C6-7 facet fracture, status post motor vehicle accident.
On presentation in the Emergency Department, he was complaining of neck pain and left hand numbness.
He had no visible signs of trauma elsewhere on his body.
The pelvis was nontender to pressure palpation and he appeared to have no other long bone injuries on examination.
Normal sensation to light touch in all dermatomes in the right upper extremity, left lower extremity and right lower extremity.
He did have some abrasions on the ulnar side of his wrist and forearm.
He had no clonus on the right but did appear to have two to three beats of clonus on the left.
Plain cervical spine films showed normal alignment and no visible fracture.
CT of the cervical spine showed a C1 left lateral mass fracture through the articulation with C2.
C6 and 7 had left laminar fracture and facet fracture which were undisplaced.
He was believed that he had most likely disrupted the C7 root given mild C7 radiculopathy.
The magnetic resonance scan showed degenerative disc disease and arthritis throughout the neck with a small disc herniation at C6-7.
The patient opted against any type of cervical fusion secondary to his unwillingness to lose any range of motion in his neck at this time.
He also felt that since his symptoms were improving that he could operating table for a conservative pathway.
At that point, we were left with the decision as to whether to place him in a hard collar or halo.
This includes no driving, no lifting, no exercise and no other activity that would involve the possibility of twisting or turning his neck.
It was reiterated to the patient that if he were to engage in any type of activity that would compromise the cervical collar fixation, he could end up with worsening of the fractures in his neck and possibly paralysis or even death.
