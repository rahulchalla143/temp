Questionable minimal subarachnoid bleed.
Differential diagnosis is broad and includes AVM, underlying mass, venous thrombosis.
CT TORSO [**5-21**]: Enlarged calcified and non-calcified mediastinal and hillar and axillary lymph nodes.
periportal edema and pericholecystic fluid.
About 2 cm measuring intensely enhancing mass in the posterior right occipital lobe with associated 3-cm hematoma anterior to the mass causing vasogenic edema and 6-mm shift of normally midline structures to the left.
Two additional enhancing, hemorrhagic lesions in the right frontal lobe.
Differential diagnosis is broad and includes metastatic disease from unknown primary, multifocal primary glial neoplasm, or hemorrhagic tumefactive demyelinating disease.
No evidence of vascular abnormalities including no evidence of vascular malformation or intracranial venous thrombosis.
Expected post-surgical changes with small amount of blood products surrounding the surgical cavity, pneumocephalus in the surgical cavity and in the subdural space adjacent to the parieto-occipital craniotomy.
Compared to the pre-surgical CT, unchanged vasogenic edema in the right parietal lobe.
No evidence of significant intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 19M who was origionally evaluated by our ED approximatley 6 weeks prior to URI and dental pain, returns on [**5-20**] with increased confusion.
He was taken to the ER by his friends, when CT of the head was done, revealing a right occipital hyperlucency with significant mass effect and midline shift.
He tolerated the procedure well; the intraoperative pathology report was consistent with abscess.
His post op head CTs demonstrated no acute hemorrhage.
Dental x-rays showed no dental abcesses.
You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and report any of the following problems to your physician.
Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your incision.
o	An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.
New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from which you wake up confused.
Due to the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency situations cannot be given over the telephone.
Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.
?You will  need a CT scan of the brain with & without contrast.
