HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old Caucasian male with a history of acquired factor 8 deficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and walking times two days prior to admission.
The patient has had periodic episodes in the past six months up to three to four times, which typically lasts one to two days and then resolved by itself.
Sensation and proprioception by report were intact and there had been no incontinence.
Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**] was thought to have had hematemesis secondary to small [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear and he was not further evaluated.
At [**Hospital1 190**] he was noted to have cough and fever.
He [**Hospital1 1834**] chest CT per pulmonary recommendations, which showed diffuse emphysema, lunate configuration of the trachea, consistent with tracheomalacia, narrowing of the distal right upper lobe bronchus and some thickening of the wall, which may represent neoplasm.
There were also peripheral multifocal opacities especially in the right upper lobe.
Mr.  [**Known lastname 26907**] [**Known lastname 1834**] bronchoscopy, which showed right upper lobe foreign body, which was notable for evidence of aspiration pneumonia.
Thus, he was started on Levaquin and Flagyl for possible aspiration pneumonia, as well as treatment chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
He was also seen by the Department of Neurology during his admission, who thought that the main differential diagnosis included AVM versus spinal ischemia as the mechanical cause for his lower extremity weakness and also sensory deficit, especially significant for pain and temperature changes.
Mr.  [**Known lastname 26907**] [**Known lastname 1834**] MRI on [**2-24**], which showed increased T2 signal in the distal thoracic areas down to his conus consistent with ischemia/demyelination.
Repeat MR was done on [**3-6**], which showed diffuse atheromatous disease in the infrarenal abdominal aorta, compression fracture of the left vertebral body and focal stenosis in the origin of the internal mammary artery.
However, the procedure was unsuccessful secondary to diffuse atherosclerosis in the spinal arteries.
Post procedure, the patient was extubated with respiratory distress and re-intubated.
He was also treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare with Albuterol and Atrovent nebs and Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV q.8h.
Chest x-ray on [**2147-3-9**] showed ill-defined opacity in the right middle lobe and the right lower lobes, which were unchanged since the previous examination.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with pulmonary function tests on [**2147-3-6**] showing FEV1 of 0.59, which is 22% and FEV1/FVC of 63% predicted.
Tracheomalacia status post prolonged intubation after nephrectomy.
Distal humeral resection for lipoma.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's sister died of a heart attack at the age of 40.
His mother died of some unknown gynecological cancer.
GENERAL:  This is a moderate obese Caucasian male lying in bed in no acute distress.
Anicteric sclerae.
Dentures in place on the upper palate, no thyroidectomy or lymphadenopathy.
No supraclavicular nodes.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops could be appreciated.
ABDOMEN:  Normoactive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended, no masses.
Obese abdomen.
EXTREMITIES:  Clean, dry, and intact, no swelling.
He has most proximal lower extremity weakness, which is worse on the right side, rather than the left.
RESPIRATORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**] has a history of tracheomalacia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recent aspiration pneumonia, which has overall contributed to his shortness of breath and oxygen requirement.
He had no oxygen requirement at home.
He likely failed extubation secondary to sedation rather than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or pneumonia worsening.
Repeat bronchoscopy was offered secondary to final rule out of possible neoplasm especially in the right upper lobe with wall thickening.
His oxygen requirement has been weaned down from four liters to two liters with good results.
Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**] continues on Albuterol and Atrovent MDI for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
His steroids have been tapered with a quick taper and he will be discharged on those steroids.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**]' symptoms were likely secondary to arteriovenous malformation versus spinal ischemia.
The main thought is that Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**] suffers from spinal ischemia secondary to diffuse atherosclerosis as seen in his attempted CT angiogram.
He finally did undergo CT myelogram on [**2147-3-15**], which showed degenerative disk disease at multiple levels of the lumbar spine and minimal myelomalacia in the thoracic area.
There is no arteriovenous malformation seen.
In the intervening time, Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**]' lower extremity weakness has minimally improved with the ability to internally and externally rotate the right lower extremity with ease.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] swallowing study on [**2147-3-13**], which showed the following: Slightly atypical oral preparation with delayed bullous formation.
There was intermittent premature spill with thin liquids noted in the hypopharynx.
There was mild residue, which was spontaneously cleared by second swallow.
There was no aspiration of any consistency.
At that time, the Speech and Swallow Department was following and recommendation upright for all p.o., monitoring for signs and symptoms of aspiration, slow pace of p.o.
HEMATOLOGY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26907**] had no signs or symptoms of abnormal bleeding during his hospital stay.
All stools were guaiac tested, but there was no further need for transfusions.
Bilateral lower extremities weakness likely secondary to spinal ischemia/severe atherosclerotic disease 2.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Aspiration pneumonia.
