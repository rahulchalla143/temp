Admission Date:  [**2179-5-17**]       Discharge Date: [**2179-5-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2108-3-13**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2176**], hypertension, and a former smoking history as well as a family history of coronary artery disease and age greater than 55, who presented with increased shortness of breath, chest pain and nausea and vomiting on the morning of admission to [**Hospital3 3583**].
The patient stated he was in his usual state of health until last Saturday when, after dialysis, he began to feel short of breath.
He also had some left-sided chest pain but can't remember it well.
The shortness of breath persisted the following day as well as on the day of admission.
He said it was worse on both days in the early morning, but only on the day of admission was it accompanied by nausea and vomiting as well as chest pain which he stated occurred in the left, right and middle chest.
He had no angina in [**2176**] when he was stented.
He denied any peripheral edema, long-standing orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or claudication.
The chest x-ray showed questionable right lower lobe infiltrate versus congestive heart failure, so he was given Levaquin.
He was brought to [**Hospital1 69**] for catheterization which showed two-vessel disease, but intervention could not be accomplished given the location of the lesions.
Diabetes mellitus type 2 diet controlled.
Coronary artery disease status post right coronary artery stent in [**2176**].
Congestive heart failure.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis since [**2177**].
Left foot abscess history.
Diltia XT.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for fevers but positive for chills, positive for a nonproductive cough, negative for melena or hematochezia, negative for urinary symptoms.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father had coronary artery disease.
General:  The patient was in no apparent distress and looked older than his stated age.
Neck: Significant for jugular venous distension to the jaw.
No bruits and no lymphadenopathy.
Chest:  Significant for diffuse wheezing anteriorly and a Tesio catheter on the right side of the chest.
Cardiovascular:  Examination was significant for distant heart sounds, S1 and S2 normal, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
There was a tissue defect on the left ball of the foot reflecting a previous abscess incision and drainage.
Neurological: Nonfocal, alert and oriented x 3 with no asterixis.
EKG revealed sinus tachycardia, normal axis and intervals, no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, low voltage, Qs in 2, 3 and F that were old, and pseudonormalization in 1, 2, 3 and F as well as questionable ST and T wave changes in V1 through V5.
Cardiac catheterization revealed two-vessel coronary artery disease with a left anterior descending coronary artery distal occlusion, a left circumflex 40-50% long obtuse marginal #1, right coronary artery stent from a previous catheterization patent with a small distal PL lesion of 70% at the origin.
Cardiac catheterization revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension and a wedge pressure of 32, with PA pressures of 50/27 and a mean of 34.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 67-year-old man with multiple cardiac risk factors, also end-stage renal disease, here with shortness of breath and chest pain concerning for acute coronary syndrome.
The patient could not be started on a beta blocker because of hypotension.
Because his coronary artery disease was not repaired during cardiac catheterization, the decision was made to keep the patient on heparin drip during his hospital stay.
This heparin drip had to be discontinued on [**5-24**] because of persistent oozing from a groin line.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient was admitted with pulmonary edema.
Multiple chest x-rays were taken throughout his hospital stay to assess the status of his congestive heart failure.
An echocardiogram was obtained, which revealed mild left atrial dilatation, an ejection fraction of 30-35%, akinesis of the distal half of the left ventricle and posterior wall, severe thickening and deformity of the aortic valve leaflet, mild aortic valve stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, mild mitral valve leaflet thickening, mild mitral regurgitation.
Based on the echocardiogram results, the patient was deemed appropriate for long-term anticoagulation, but this was not started immediately, given his hemodialysis issues which are further described below.
An attempt was made to start the patient on Coreg for his failure, but this had to be held because of hypotension.
Atrial fibrillation:  The patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation without any symptoms while undergoing hemodialysis during his hospital stay.
He did not have any further recurrence of his atrial fibrillation while in house.
His hemodialysis access site, which consisted of a Tesio catheter, had to be discontinued after he spiked a fever in house and the line was considered a potential source of infection.
Infectious disease:  The patient had an episode of shivering without fever or hypotension while at dialysis.
There was no evidence of a urinary tract infection.
There was no evidence of a pneumonia by either sputum culture or chest x-ray.
The patient did have multiple bottles grow positive for coagulase-negative staphylococcus.
Given the degree of bacteremia, the patient was continued on vancomycin which he had been started on when presumptive identification of Gram-positive cocci had been made.
The patient has been afebrile while on vancomycin.
The surgery team was requested to consult for placement of a new hemodialysis access site.
Cough and wheezing:  The patient has a smoking history and thus was presumed to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of a pneumonia.
He was consented and he suffered no complications on the transfusion which was arranged to be delivered during hemodialysis.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient had several episodes of hyperkalemia without symptoms or EKG changes.
