Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 64973**] Admission Date: [**2118-2-25**] Discharge Date: [**2118-3-15**] Date of Birth:  [**2047-12-14**] Sex:  F Service:  VSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 70-year-old female, with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm, transferred from an outside hospital with severe abdominal tenderness and hypotension.
A CT scan at the outside hospital showed no extravasation; however, she was hypotensive on evaluation with severe abdominal pain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for cryptogenic cirrhosis, mitral valve regurg, lap-chole, total abdominal hysterectomy, status post appendectomy, and status post ventral hernia repair.
ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
She had significant abdominal tenderness with guarding.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was taken to the operating room emergently for a question of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Intraoperatively, it was found that she had a large aneurysm.
There was also extensive bleeding from her cirrhosis and; therefore, she was left packed and open.
After this was done, over the next couple of days she stabilized, bladder pressures were followed, and she was treated for ARDS with an esophageal balloon, and ventilatory management, and an echo was done which showed normal EF.
The patient was then returned to the operating room for abdominal washout.
Postoperatively, from the second washout she was continued on ventilatory management, and she was kept on Levophed for blood pressure control.
She continued to require significant fluid resuscitation, as she was losing over 3-4 liters of ascites fluid from her open abdomen.
VAC dressings were changed at the bedside multiple times, and there was slow granulation tissue.
Pancultures were done, and she was found to have Pseudomonas in her lungs and; therefore, she was changed from Zosyn to meropenem.
She became afebrile at that point, and she continued to do well from a pulmonary standpoint.
However, she continued to require high ventilatory support with high PEEP and high pressure support, and she was intermittently switched back and forth between assist control and CPAP.
The liver ultrasound found that she had thrombosed her portal vein, and because of her dropping hematocrit, the hepatology service proceeded with an endoscopy.
Multiple esophageal varices were identified, and while no active bleeding was present, these were significant, and felt that they would likely cause bleeding in the future.
Again, she began having high fevers, and she had ventilator acquired pneumonia with the Pseudomonas, and this had now become resistant to meropenem.
At the same time, she had blood cultures which had gram-positive cocci.
During one of these episodes of hypotension, she had some [**Known lastname **] changes which were concerning for myocardial ischemia.
They felt that ultimately this was due to demand ischemia from her overwhelming sepsis.
They had no further suggestions other than supportive care as tolerable.
The family was present throughout multiple of these decisions, and it was decided ultimately that she would be made DNR pending any further results or deterioration.
Esophageal varices.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post abdominal aneurysm     repair.
Status post abdominal washouts.
Status post tracheostomy for respiratory failure.
Ventilator acquired pneumonia.
