History of Present Illness: 56 year old man with HIV, DM2, CAD, h/o seizures, alcoholic cirrhosis and known varices s/p banding on [**2169-9-18**] initially presented to OSH with bright red hematemesis.
He continued to have hematemesis with worsening hypotension (SBP 60s) despite IVF and PRBCs (7L NS + 5units PRBCs total).
Endoscopy attempted but unsuccessful due to continued hematemesis.
He had no further bleeding and received ceftriaxone 1g and 2 units FFP.

MODERATE GROWTH.
The gallbladder is normal without evidence of stones.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
There is a small amountof ascites.
The right, left, and main hepatic arteries are patent with appropriate waveforms demonstrating sharp systolic upstroke and preserved flow through diastole.
CXR [**9-29**]: Greater opacification in the left lower lobe is probably worsened atelectasis.
Moderate-to-severe atelectasis in the right lower lung is stable or increased and small bilateral pleural effusions have increased as well.
Minimal remnant retrocardiac atelectasis.
No pleural effusions.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
[**10-3**] CT Head- No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
[**10-5**] EEG- This EEG showed some low voltage patterns alternating with widespread alpha frequencies.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features.

# UGIB/Variceal bleed: Per report, source of UGIB felt to be variceal in nature from findings at endoscopy and hemostasis achieved with no further episodes of bleeding since banding on [**9-18**].
Passage of maroon stool (the reason for transfer) was felt to most likely represent blood in trasnsit from UGIB rather than separate source.
Repeat EGD was not performed as patient did not have further episodes of variceal bleeding.
During ICU course received 3 units of pRBCs and 2 units FFP as there was some blood found in his ETT.
# Hypotension: Patient hypotensive on admission, likely secondary to hypovolemia and GIB.
As hemodynamics stabilized, patient became hypertensive and was restarted on his home enalopril, HCTZ, and nadolol with good pressure control.
# ETOH abuse c/b cirrhosis: At high risk for EtOH withdrawal given positive level at OSH, h/o seizures and reported daily use.
Patient was started on lactulose secondary to altered mental status (see below).
# Hospital acquired pneumonia- Patient developed hospital acquired pneumonia following extubation on [**10-1**].
Was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and then coverage narrowed down to cefepime for 8 days to treat pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
He required a brief period of reintubation ([**Date range (1) 41932**]) secondary to hypoxia and altered mental status (see below).
# Delirium- Patient was noted to have altered mental status, with agitation requiring restraints.
Was noted to have left gaze deviation and neurology was consulted.
Recommended CT head (negative for acute process) and continuous EEG monitoring for seizures (drowsiness/mild encephelopathy, negative for seizures on [**10-3**] and encephelopathy w/ some medication effect on [**10-5**]).
Delirium was attributed to prolonged ICU course, medications, and possible hepatic encephelopathy.
He was started on lactulose, frequently reoriented, and symptoms gradually improved.
# Diabetes: On insulin at home.
Was monitored on EEG with no epileptiform activity.
# Depression/Anxiety: Sertraline and seroquel were held while patient NPO, but restarted once he was taking POs.

While you were here at the [**Hospital1 18**] you were treated for a pneumonia and delirium.
