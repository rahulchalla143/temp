Admission Date:  [**2141-1-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-2-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-11-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Increased somnolence  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy, central line placement, PICC placement   History of Present Illness: 53 year old male with severe COPD, remote L CVA (residual R sided weakness), DM, hypercarbic respiratory failure, chronically vented was sent to ED because of worsening somnolence and hypotension.
He has been intubated at the beginning of [**Month (only) 359**] [**2140**], reportedly at [**Hospital3 **] for hypercarbic respiratory failure in setting of severe COPD.
Before that he has been O2 dependent due to severe COPD, living at a NH.
At the OSH, he was found to have a RML and RLL collapse and paratracaheal LAD as well as chronic right pleural effusions.
He also has questionable old granulomatous lung disease with calcified hilar LAD.
He eventually required trach/PEG because of difficulties weaning from the vent.
However, since the end of [**Month (only) **], his respiratory status worsened again and he remained on AC.
He was treated for VAP in [**Month (only) 1096**] here due to pseudomonas ESBL.
The day of admission, he underwent a T-piece trial and then was found to be unresponsive on the floor.
The circumstances are unclear and oral report from the [**Name (NI) **] included tonic-clonic movements, while another report does not confirm that.
A CXR showed chronich RLL collapse but then subsequently after a R subclavian line placement showed almost complete R sided white-out with a [**Last Name (un) **] off at the R mainstem bronchus.
He persisted to be hypotensive and was started on Levophed.
He was only complaining of mild R foot pain but did not recall and injury to the foot.
He reports that he had a seizure, but denies any complete LOC.
He denies any CP, abd pain, HA, vision changes, f,c,ns, dysuria, problems breathing or worsening secretions.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2141-1-31**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
MODERATE GROWTH.
**FINAL REPORT [**2141-2-1**]**    FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2141-2-1**]):    NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2141-1-30**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
OVA + PARASITES (Final [**2141-1-30**]):       NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN.
FECAL CULTURE - R/O VIBRIO (Final [**2141-1-30**]):    NO VIBRIO FOUND.
FECAL CULTURE - R/O YERSINIA (Final [**2141-1-31**]):    NO YERSINIA FOUND.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2141-1-29**]):       FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2141-1-27**] 10:14 PM IMPRESSION: Persistent volume loss of the right hemithorax.
Right lung base opacity could be a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis.
Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, acute major vascular territorial infarction, cerebral edema or fracture.
Probable remote left cerebellar infarction.
Short segment uncomplicated sigmoid colitis, which is non-specific and may be infectious/inflammatory in etiology.
Incompletely imaged bilateral pleural effusions, with partial collapse of the right lower lobe which may be post-obstructive, given the presence of fuid in the right lower lobe bronchus.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 53M on chronic trach-mask for COPD/RLL collapse/R pleural effusions, L CVA (residual R sided weakness), DM, admitted for unresponsiveness likely [**2-11**] sepsis.
# Hypoxia secondary to chronic R pleural effusions, R lung collapse, severe COPD and tracheostomy:  Initial ABG revealed chronic hypercarbia and compensated respiratory acidosis.
Initially suspected mucuous plug and subsequent lung collapse as possibly contributoring to hypoxia, or aspiration pneumonia given that patient was found down.
Sputum culture revealed Pseudomonas sensitive all antibiotics except ciprofloxacin.
Initially had bronchoscopy on [**1-28**] given persistent R lung collapse with resultant suctioning and sample sent to microbiology lab that revealed PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA ~[**2133**]/ML with the same sensitivities.
Bronchoscopy was again peformed on [**2141-2-1**], the day of discharge, for persistent R lower lobe collapse despite clinical improvement.
The [**Hospital1 18**] Microbiology lab can be contact[**Name (NI) **] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 20850**] for final results.
Additionally, given his bronchoscopy the day of discharge, it would not be unusual for him to have a post-bronch fever 12-hours post-procedure.
#Diverticulitis:  New RLQ pain [**1-31**] overnight.
CT-demonstrated diverticulitis without abscess or collection.
No WBC count, no fever.
Given that he was already on Meropenem, and no evidence of new infection, no further antibiotics were added.
Recommended brief bowel rest with resolution of tubefeeding once pain resolved slightly.
# Seizures: STABLE.
Per rehab neurology note, one GTC seizure in [**Month (only) **], thought to be due to post-CVA and metabolic abnormalities.
Per discussion with nursing home staff, no sign of seizure at time of unresponsiveness.
# Unresponsiveness: RESOLVED.
Unlikely hypoxia as is chronic at baseline, and ABGs did not show marked change.
No evidence of seizure.
# H/o CVA: Right sided weakness.
# Psychological Issues: STABLE.
Schizophrenia and depression.
Acetaminophen 160 mg/5 mL Solution [**Hospital1 **]: Ten (10) mL PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
