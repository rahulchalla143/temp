The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid- and distal septal segments, as well as of the apex and distal inferior wall.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.1 cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate aortic stenosis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2124-1-26**], new wall motion abnormalities are seen.
Severity of all valvular abnormalities has progressed.
There are increased vascular markings and hilar fullness suggestive of volume overload but underlying infection is not excluded.
IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the chest with probable cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
No midline shift.
Left frontal encephalomalacia.
No depressed skull fracture.
Mild opacification of the mastoid, more prominent on the left with no bony destruction.
Mild ethmoidal sinus mucosal thickening.
No acute fracture of the cervical spine.
Severe degenerative changes predispose this patient to spinal cord injury with minor trauma.
In the appropriate clinical context, (for example myelopathy), consider MR for further characterization.
Right apical nodule versus apical scarring.
Right pleural effusion.
Extensive degenerative changes at cranio-cervical junction.
Nonspecific calcinosis.
Extensive degenerative changes throughout the hand and the wrist as above.
Right lower lobe opacity has minimally increased; this is most likely atelectasis, but infectious process cannot be totally excluded.
Right upper parahilar opacity is less conspicuous than before, not resolved.
Minimal atelectasis in the left base is unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

Urine [**2129-1-18**]: PENDING [**2129-1-8**] 07:30AM   PLT COUNT-387  Brief Hospital Course: Dyspnea: The patient presented with acute dyspnea with associated wheezing, initially requiring a NRB to maintain sats.
Out of concern for vocal chord dysfunction, he was evaluated by [**Month/Day/Year **] who found normal vocal cords.
His lower respiratory wheeze was thought to be a COPD/asthma exacerbation complicated by a possible RUL pneumonia.
Nursing concern was raised for aspiration on multiple occasions, however after multiple evaluations by S+S, he was consistently found to only aspirate thin liquids.
NSTEMI: The patient also presented with positive cardiac biomarkers and inferolateral ST depressions concerning for ACS.
An echocardiogram showed new focal wall motion abnormalities.
He also received approximately 48 hours of IV heparin prior to determining that no intervention was planned.
His cardiac enzymes were trended throughout his stay due to multiple episodes of AFIB with RVR, however he never manifested demand ischemia, despite a persistently poor EKG of which Cardiology was aware.
Hematuria: The patient developed hematuria in the setting of Foley placement and heparin gtt.
He was examined with renal u/s, which revealed no masses.
Urine cytology was sent twice, the first of which did not reveal malignant cells.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Several times during his stay on the floor, Mr. [**Known lastname **] went into AFIB with RVR.
He was anticoagulated as below and did not need further anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.
Also noted to have cold and clamminess on the right foot.
EGD was performed which revealed Dilaufoy's lesion vs. bleeding ulcer that was clipped.
Falls: The patient had been having increased falls at home.
A CT head/neck showed no acute trauma.
Foot Pain: During end of hospitalization, the patient developed exquisite foot pain, felt likely due to gout.
On day of discharge, he had mild erythema on the lateral dorsum of his left foot and tenderness at the 2nd MCP, though this was markedly improved since starting colchicine.
- Bilateral lower ischemia.
- UGIB: dieulafoy vs. duodenal ulcer.

- Atrial fibrillation.
- Hematuria - Systolic heart failure - Aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.1 cm2) - Dysphagia - MRSA - gout  Secondary: - Left frontal CVA with hemiparesis.
- Diabetes mellitus type II.

Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath.
You were also found to have poor blood flow into your feet, so you were seen by the vascular surgeons.
You were placed on heparin and warfarin, both blood thinners, for your extensive peripheral vascular disease.
You also had atrial fibrillation, an arrhythmia, which was controlled with medications.
Your INR (blood level of coumadin) was found to be elevated at 4.3.
