LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe symmetric LVH.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
Simple atheroma in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Mildly dilated descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mild mitral annular calcification.
post-bypass: Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Other findings are unchanged    Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1124**] was admitted on [**2195-6-18**] for a cardiac catheterization, pre-operative work-up and intra-venous heparin.
His surgery was post-poned for an elevated INR and then his INR was allowed to drift down without intervention.
His bypass time was 133 minutes with a crossclamp x of 104 minutes He tolerated this procedure well and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the surgical intensive care unit.
