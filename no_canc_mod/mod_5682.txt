Admission Date:  [**2199-6-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-7-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2119-2-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**] Chief Complaint: Worsening SOB   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 80 yo male with COPD p/w worsening dyspnea, SpO2 86% on room air per EMS.
Recently discharged on [**6-26**] with diagnosis of COPD flare, sent home on prednisone taper and azithromycin x 5 days.
Went to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1968**] for PCP appointment two days after discharge, and no changes in medication and was feeling well.
He was doing well until day prior to admission when he reports worsening dyspnea with exertion, barely able to ambulate from room to room today.
He slept overnight with 3 pillows and wife reports that he had labored breathing with wheezing.
He awoke from afternoon nap with acute dyspnea, was reported white in face by son, and wife called EMS.
On the floor, patient complained of shortness of breath, cramps in the legs that is chronic, and productive cough and x1 bought of watery diarrhea without blood; but denies chest pain, palpitations, fever, chills, nausea, vomitting, constipation, dysuria, muscle, or swelling in legs.
Past Medical History: -Hypertension -Tobacco abuse -COPD -s/p AAA repair in [**2196-5-8**] c/b brief postoperative atrial fibrillation -Chronic Kidney Disease (seconary to vascular disease) -Prostate cancer s/p radiation therapy and leupron -Skin cancer   Social History: Lives with wife.
Family History: Noncontributory   Physical Exam: VS 97.2, 132/68, 72, 96% RL, 72.4 kg Gen: lying flat in bed, dyspenic, with oxygen, "puckered" breathing HEENT: NCAT, EOMI, PEERLA, no LAD, MMM CV: s1, s2 appreciated, no MRG Lungs: use of accessory muscles when breathing, harsh breath sounds, wheezing heard throughout, hyperinflation Abd: ventral hernia, vertical scar, soft, NTND, +BS Ext: WWP, no CCE Neuro: A&O x3, moves all extremities, normal tone, follow commands   Pertinent Results: CXR: PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: The heart size remains normal and the aorta is mildly unfolded.
Increased interstitial markings, particularly in the perihilar region likely represent interstitial pulmonary edema in this patient with underlying COPD.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax and no definite pleural effusions seen.
IMPRESSION: Interstitial pulmonary edema in the setting of COPD.
Non-specific septal T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-7-29**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 y/o male with COPD exacerbation and PNA, died of hypotension and MSOF.
He had been recently discharged on [**6-26**] with diagnosis of COPD flare, sent home on prednisone taper and azithromycin x 5 days.
He was thought to have COPD exacerbation/ PNA and was treated with Levaquin PO and long steroid taper, and remained on 2-3L NC.
On [**7-4**] because of low grade fevers and unimproved oxygen requirement a CT chest, non contrast was done that showed diffuse peribronchovascular and periperhal parenchymal opacities with associated bronchial wall thickening, as well as centrilobular emphysema, concerning for fungal infection.
The patient reports sudden onset of shortness of shortness of breath when getting up to go to the bathroom.
He was transferred to the MICU for further stabilization of respiratory status.
He was intubated due to increasing respiratory distress.
Mr. [**Known lastname 8764**] became hypotensive and was bolused 2L NS, which were ineffective.
He had progressively increasing O2 requirements on the vent, set at AC with high O2, TV, and PEEP.
In the afternoon of [**7-8**], Mr. [**Known lastname 8764**] continued to recieve fluid resuscitation with NS and LR, to mild effectiveness.
As the pt's underlying condition was unclear, he was bronched, which showed pulmonary macrophages, inflammatory cells and fungal forms suggestive of aspergillus (results returned postmortem).
As pt continued to be hypotensive and tachycardic, LR was continued at 500cc/hr.
An ABG showed severe acidosis, so the pt was given bicarb.
Overnight, the patient's hypotension became unresponsive to fluids and pressors, his sats dropped, he became increasingly tachycardic.
The underlying cause is unknown; aspergillus multilobar pneumonia is in the differential diagnosis but the cause is uncertain.
CKD Stage 3: Stayed near his baseline creatinine of 1.9 until respiratory failure.
HTN: Continued home meds lisinopril, HCTZ, atenolol until became hypotensive with respiratory distress.
