she had a hematoma on the R forehead with "large frank bleed."
She received 3L of NS and was treated for possible infection with levofloxacin, flagyl, and vancomycin.
She was also given a tetanus shot and had stitches for her scalp laceration.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 47433**] for hypernatremia due to poor free water access.

RESP: mild basilar rales B. CV: RRR.
Mild L facial droop.
Skin: large stage IV sacral decub.
Urine Micro:    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2187-6-13**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No sign of cervical spine fracture or acute malalignment.
Degenerative changes as detailed above.
Xray foot: FINDINGS: Patient is extremely demineralized which limits evaluation for subtle fractures.
Allowing for this, no displaced fractures are seen.
There is severe hallux valgus metatarsus varus of the first MTP joint with degenerative changes.
There are deformities of the shaft of the second and fourth metatarsals suggestive of prior old fracture with subsequent healing.
No bony erosions are seen.
Xray pelvis: IMPRESSION: No fracture.
CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
EKG: Sinus rhythm Low inferolateral lead T wave amplitude is nonspecific Since previous tracing of [**2187-6-10**], sinus tachycardia absent and ST-T wave changes decreased .
No abnormal fluid collections that would be concerning for retroperitoneal hemorrhage 2.
Known deep venous thrombus involving the left common iliac vein is not well seen on this non-contrast examination 3.
Markedly abnormal appearance of the gallbladder not significantly changed since [**2187-3-27**] more fully characterized on prior contrast enhanced study.
Incompletely characterized 18 x 16-mm right ovarian rounded lesion that if of clinical concern, a pelvic ultrasound can be performed for further characterization.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo female with hx of dementia, T2DM on insulin, afib, hx dvt, hx of cholangitis, UTI's, c-diff, presented after being found down in her nursing home with R frontal hematoma with urosepsis and DKA.
Her WBC had normalized and she remained afebrile at the time of discharge.
# Anemia, unspecified: Patient's H/H was followed closely throughout the hospitalization, as her H/H appeared to slowly drift down.
# Hypotension:  Upon hospitalization and throughout the patient's stay in the ICU, she had multiple episodes of low blood pressure.
Her hypotension was most likely thought to be multifactorial including hypovolemia from poor PO intake complicated by hyperglycemia, sepsis, acute blood loss.
# ST depressions on EKG: Although she did not c/o chest pain, she is not a reliable historian.
# ARF:  baseline Cr 0.7-0.8, Pt was noted to have acute renal failure on admission, with BUN/Cr max 20/1.2.
# Scalp laceration:  Repaired in ED and Tetanus shot given.
# Left common femoral DVT diagnosed [**3-22**]: Patient is on coumadin as an outpt.
This was held due to concerns of significant anemia in the ICU that required transfusion of 2 units PRBC.
# h/o Hypernatremia/dehydration: It was noted that patient has a history of recurrent hypernatremia because of dementia and poor water intake.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer and heel ulcer: The patient was noted to have a stage IV large coccygeal ulcer and a stage III R heel ulcer.
# History of recurrent choledocholithiasis/cholangitis s/p ERCPs/Stent: Patient has a pigtail placed [**5-31**].
# AFib on coumadin:  Currently in NSR.
- Diltiazem is currently being held due to concerns of hypotension in the ICU.
Her HR remained well controlled, and pt did not become hypertensive.
Please resume if HR or BP become elevated.
Coumadin was initially held due to concern about anemia requiring 2 units PRBC.
# Alzheimer's Dementia: severe, at baseline.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 4470**] Health care  Discharge Diagnosis: # Urosepsis; e.coli # Diabetic ketoacidosis # Anemia, unspecified # Recent DVT, on coumadin # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation # Alzheimer's disease, severe   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after a fall, with the findings of urosepsis and DKA.
