Admission Date:  [**2163-5-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-6-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-1-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30201**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 73 year old woman with hx of ESRD on HD, diastolic CHF, PVD s/p bilateral lower leg amputations, and atrial fibrillation presenting with shortness of breath.
She was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2163-5-14**] following an admission for hypertensive urgency complicated by hypoxia due to pulmonary edema.
During that admission, she was placed on CPAP, had blood pressure control with a nitroglycerin gtt initally and had extra HD/UF sessions.
There was no clear etiology to the decompensation as she had no clear cardiac ischemic event nor missed HD session.
On Saturday night she first noted shortness of breath when she was trying to sleep.
She denied chest pain, cough, or diaphoresis.
Past Medical History: - Diastolic CHF with LVOT obstruction at rest - Chronic 2L NC at night - Hypertension - Diabetes - Peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral knee amputations in [**2146**] (L) and [**2157**] (R) - GERD - Hypercholesterolemia - ESRD on hemodialysis M,W,F.
- Paroxysmal atrial flutter, s/p failed ablation with subsequent a. fib - Peptic ulcer disease - Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy - Mild mitral stenosis (MVA 1.5-2.0 cm2) - Secondary Hyperparathyroidism - Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure  Social History: Social history is significant for the presence of current tobacco use (1 pack per week), and [**12-22**] PPD x 50 years.
Lives in [**Hospital3 **] facility and uses a mobile wheelchair or a walker.

no femoral bruits.
No asterixis PSYCH: appropriate affect  Pertinent Results: EKG [**2163-5-30**]:Sinus rhythm.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave changes.
Left atrial abnormality.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2163-5-13**] the ST-T wave changes are more prominent and may represent superimposed inferolateral ischemic process.
Renal U/S [**5-31**]: IMPRESSION: No solid renal masses identified.
Echogenic kidneys consistent with chronic renal disease and multiple bilateral small simple renal cysts.
CXR: Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess as there are dense fluffy bilateral perihilar consolidations, obscuring the heart borders.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**2163-3-24**] TTE - The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 9 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe symmetric LVH with a small cavity and hyperdynamic systolic function.
Moderate functional mitral stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):   Brief Hospital Course: 73 year old woman with hx of diastolic CHF, DM2, ESRD on HD presenting with acute hypoxia and hypertensive urgency .
# Hypoxia: Given her hx of severe dCHF, difficulty removing fluid at HD due to LVOT obstruction, pulmonary edema on presentation CXR, hypoxia appeared most consistent with diastolic CHF exacerbation.
As she was hypertensive to the 200s systolic and reported palpitations prior to admission, both htn and perhaps a.fib with RVR caused worsening of her pulmonary edema on presentation.
Although she had leukocytosis, she was without fever, cough, sputum production to suggest underlying pulmonary infection.
She does have hyperinflated lungs on CXR and was mildly bronchospastic on admission, so she was started on azithromycin, spireva, and albuterol nebs.
Cardiac enzymes x3 showed flat troponin at 0.04-0.05 and negative MBI so as not to suggest ischemic event.
She was, however, without fever and no clear source of infection.
CXR showed pulmonary edema and small effusions without clear evidence of infiltrate and she was without cough and fever.
She had no GI symptoms to suggest as possible infective source.
As she was initially mildly bronchospastic on exam, she was started on azithromycin x 5 day course.
COPD:  No formal diagnosis, however lungs markedly hyperinflated on CXR and with significant pack year history of tobacco use with continued use (although less so).
There was initially some concern for COPD contributing to her hypoxia given mild bronchospasm on presentation.
Renal U/S was negative for mass suggestive of erythropoietin producing mass.
# End-stage renal disease: She was continued on her home phos binder and nephrocaps and was continued on HD qMWF as per her normal schedule.
# Atrial fibrillation: She remained in NSR while in house and INR was therapeutic on presentation.
# HTN:  She was briefly on nitro gtt upon arrival to the ICU given SBPs in the 200s.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2 with complication of nephropathy: She was continued on her home dose NPH with sliding scale coverage.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] [**Location (un) 269**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Major: COPD flare HTN urgency ESRD on HD .
Minor: DM afib HTN hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath and high blood pressure.
If you develop fevers, chills, increasing shortness of breath, chest pain, weight gain >3lbs, or any other concerning symptom, please contact your doctor or go to the emergency room.
