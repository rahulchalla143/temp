There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect or infarction.
There is no fracture.
Inspissated secretions in the posterior nasopharynx likely reflect the patient's intubated status.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
There is no focal airspace opacification.
No gross osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
Brief Hospital Course: # TCA overdose: Patient presents with intoxication of doxepin; toxicology screen was positive for methadone, TCAs, and cocaine.
On HD #2, patient was extubated, and was monitored for symptoms of hypotension, palpatations, chest pain, or any other symptoms of TCA intoxication.
She was then transferred to the medicine services after patient's peak for toxic symptoms were over (active metabolites 12-24 hours), EKGs remained normal throughout the course, and she exhibited no symptoms upon discharge.
# Psychiatric Status: Patient was seen by psychiatric in the MICU for questionable suicidal ideation.
The patient denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation, and repeatedly wanted to go home.
Psychiatry reported that she has polysubstance abuse, depression, and borderline personality.
She was given Valium, Seroquel, and Ibuprofen PRN for anxiety, agitation, and possible opiate withdrawal.
#Anemia: Patient presented with hematocrit of 31.5 (baseline unknown), with microcytic features and wide RDW.
Iron levels are low (20) with low TIBC (257), and her low MCV (68) do not suggest a complete iron deficiency picture.
Iron deficiency alone is unlikely to cause such a microcytosis picture, therefore her anemia could be secondary to a mixed etiology of minor thalassemia (microcytosis of 68) and iron deficiency.
#Elevated WBC and fever: The patient had elevated WBC (20) and low-grade fever 100.4 in the MICU, but trended down while admitted to the medicine floor (WBC 12, temp 98.2).
She has no indication of infection as she clinically has no syptoms of fevers/chills and does not feel overall unwell; in addition, CXR shows no abnormalities.
The most likely etiology was s/p MICU extubation and stress response.
