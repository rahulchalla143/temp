Admission Date:  [**2135-9-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2135-9-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2085-8-6**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CT SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year old Caucasian female who has experienced dyspnea on exertion with associated wheezing since her 20s.
She was labeled with the diagnosis of asthma and for the last three decades has been treated with bronchodilator therapy and parenteral corticosteroids.
Her dyspnea on exertion and wheeze have only been associated with exercise, and there have been no trigger exacerbations consistent with asthma.
She was referred to Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine in [**Hospital **] Medical College by her primary care physician for pulmonary function testing which revealed clipping of the expiratory phase consistent with variable intrathoracic obstruction.
Bronchoscopy was performed on [**2135-5-30**], at that site which revealed external compression of the trachea two thirds of the way to the carina with posterior and lateral wall impingement.
There was also approximately a 30% lumen diameter decrease with forced expiration.
Followed with contrast CT at that same site was performed revealing a double aortic arch with right side larger than left with respective carotid and subclavian arteries on the ipsilateral arches.
Tracheal narrowing at the level of the double arch was approximately 8.0 millimeters.
She was then referred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for correction of double aortic arch and pulmonary follow-up.
Degenerative joint disease of the neck and back.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died at age 60 of renal disease.
Sister age 26 with thyroid disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, physical examination revealed the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
Generally, the patient was mildly obese.
The skin had good tone, no obvious skin disease.
Neck without jugular venous distention, without bruits.
The heart was regular rate and rhythm, occasional faint I/VI systolic ejection murmur was heard.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities were warm and well perfused without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
No varicosities were seen on the extremity examination with positive spider veins bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, the patient had MR of chest, mediastinum with and without contrast with magnetic resonance imaging which showed right sided aortic arch and descending aorta with mirror image, branching of the arch vessels, no cardiac structural abnormality was seen.
Large diverticulum arising from the proximal descending aorta nearly forming a complete double aortic arch.
AST 21, total bilirubin 0.3.  the patient had cardiac catheterization done preoperatively which showed no mitral regurgitation and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%.
There was a common left sided great vessel origin in ascending with a LCCA and LSCA.
There is no evidence of diverticulum in the cine images obtained.
Repeat chest x-ray showed resolution of pneumothoraces.
The patient was discharged on [**2135-9-11**], postoperative day five, with lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, cardiac examination regular rate and rhythm, abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended and the patient was afebrile and vital signs were stable on discharge.
FO[**Last Name (STitle) **]P PLANS:  The patient was instructed to follow-up interventional pulmonary for bronchoscopy in four weeks and was instructed to call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 51692**], for consultation bronchoscopy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient had CT of neck with tracheal reconstruction without contrast the day of discharge and the patient was also instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2545**] four weeks after discharge.
