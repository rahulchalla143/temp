Sigmoid [**Last Name (un) **]-vaginal fistula confirmed by rectal contrast.
No extraluminal free air.
Significant sigmoid diverticulitis.
Bilateral atrophic kidneys.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo F with lupus nephritis, CKD on HD, CAD s/p CABG, HTN, rectro-vag fistula who presented from PCP with acute respiratory distress.
Unclear cause, not vol o/l on exam or on imaging, CT without clear consolidation though patchy infiltrates with ground glass opacities.
UTI on UA, Bactermia on BCX.
SIRS physiology could precipitate acute respiratory distress that quickly resolved with IVF and abx.
Patient was initially treated with Vanc/cipro/flagyl and when blood cultures grew our GNR/GPR likely clostridium vs. bacillus, infectious disease recommended Vanc/Cipro/Meropenem.
Bacteremia: Clostridium Perfringens, E. Coli, proteus, and strep viridans were isolated from her blood as well as providencia from her urine.
Her source was likely the RV fistula, especially in setting of rectal bleeding in ED.
# Hypotension: Septic shock was most likely etiolgy with UTI and high grade bacteremia as precipitating event.
Consider hypovolemia with hct drop, though less likely, no acute s/sx significant bleeding.
She eventually became normotensive with IV abx.
# Thrombocytopenia: She has known thrombocytopenia (likely [**2-22**] lupus) which has been slowly decreasing over years and was around 90's in [**2100**].
On admission it was 44 and nadired at 35K with stopping her heparin and treating her sepsis this increased and stabilized in the 50's.
Hematology/Oncology saw patient in the MICU and recommended serologies to evaluate for heparin induced thrombocytopenia which was negative.
Differential includes sepsis induced marrow suppresion, MDS in this older patient.
patient underwent hemodialysis on her home T/Th/Sat schedule with no issues.
Continue renagel, iron and renal diet.
GI was made aware, no acute need for scoping given this is a chronic issue and patient's hematocrit remained stable.
# HTN: Restarted on metoprolol 6.25mg .
# CAD: s/p CABG, continue home meds of statin, ASA, Plavix.
