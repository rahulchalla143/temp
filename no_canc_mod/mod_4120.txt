History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 y/o M with diabetes (diagnosed in [**1-/2174**]), hyperlipidemia, HTN, and newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy who is s/p catheterization.
The patient was initially supposed to have shoulder surgery done this past [**Month (only) 958**], but was found to have elevated sugars and diagnosed with DM.
The surgery was rescheduled for earlier this month, and pre-operative ECHO was done showing biventricular dilation and severe hypokinesis, with mild mitral and moderate tricuspid regurgiation.
There was also evidence of moderate pulmonary artery systolic HTN.
Despite this EF, the patient denies any shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, or decreased exercise tolerance due to fatigue.
He does have some decreased exercise tolerance, but attributes it to R hip pain not fatigue.
The patient also denies any history of PND or sleep orthopnea.
On cath, LMCA had distal 50% disease, diffuse LAD disease with 80-90% occlusions in small vessel at mid and distal segments, total occlusion of L cx after large OM1 and diffuse disease in RCA marginal branches.
He has three children from previous marriage.
Family History: grandmother had throat cancer (was a smoker) aunt had DM  No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Sclera anicteric NECK: Supple CARDIAC: RRR, S1, S2 LUNGS: clear to auscultation b/l, no wheezes/crackles ABDOMEN: soft, non-tender, non-distended EXTREMITIES: warm, well perfused, 1+ DP/PT pulses, confirmed with Doppler, 2+ pitting edema b/l 3/4 up the shin  Pertinent Results: [**2174-6-11**] 07:05AM BLOOD Glucose-133* UreaN-22* Creat-0.8 Na-138 K-4.8 Cl-99 HCO3-27 AnGap-17 [**2174-6-8**] 07:45AM BLOOD %HbA1c-8.7* eAG-203* [**2174-6-7**] 10:00AM BLOOD Triglyc-87 HDL-45 CHOL/HD-3.8 LDLcalc-108  2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2174-5-25**] The left atrium is dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biventricular dilatation and severe hypokinesis.
Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CARDIAC CATH: [**2174-6-7**] Coronary angiography:  left dominant LMCA:  Distal 50% LAD:  Diffuse disease with serial 80-90% occlusions in a small vessel (2.0 mm) at the mid and distal segments.
Small diagonal branches have diffuse disease.
OM2 fills via collaterals.
RCA:  Likely nondominant with diffuse diseas in marginal branches and serial 80% lesions.
Admit for management of decompensated CHF and titration of medical therapy.
Secondary prevention CAD and CHF.
This revealed severe dilated cardiomyopathy with three vessel disease.
The carotid ultrasound showed a 60-69% right internal carotid artery stenosis and a 40% left internal carotid artery stenosis.
The viability study revealed a fixed defect in the distal anterior and apical region.
Given his high risk for surgery, a tranplant consutation was obtained.
He was transfused with red blood cells for postoperative anemia.
He developed a fever however work-up was negative.
He was noted to be fatigued, nauseated and jaundiced and a liver ultrasound showed no evidence of acute cholecystitis, some ascites and a poorly visualized pancreas.
His total bilirubin was elevated at 5 however trended down and was 3.9 on discharge.
His lipase was elevated at 85.
