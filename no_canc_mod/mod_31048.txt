No other change   Brief Hospital Course: Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] with chest pain and was found to have a Non- ST elevation myocardial infarction and transferred for cardiac catherization.
Her  troponin peaked to 1.75, CK MB 12.5 and cardiac catheterization that showed three vessel coronary artery disease.
She was found to have urinary tract infection that was treated with ciprofloxacin and one dose of intravenous gentamycin in the operating room.
