Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen, more marked on the left side and increased slightly since prior examination.
Patchy increase in density is seen in the right base, likely in the right lower lobe, which was not present on the prior examination and may represent some developing airspace disease.
IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in bilateral pleural effusions, more marked on the left side.
Patchy airspace disease developing in the right base.
Increased retrocardiac density are not significantly changed since prior examination and likely representing subsegmental atelectasis.
