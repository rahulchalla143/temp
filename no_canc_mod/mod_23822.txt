Admission Date:  [**2177-11-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2177-11-18**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: L sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The pt is a 85 year-old right handed male with past medical history significant for HTN, afib on Coumadin, DMII, who presented to his PCP with left sided weakness and was found at [**Location (un) **] to have a large right BG bleed that tracks into the lateral ventricles all the way to the fourth, with shift.
At the PCP's office he apparently had left sided weakness and was sent emergently to the ED at [**Location (un) **].
At [**Location (un) **] he acutely worsened and had a change in mental status and became acutely non-responsive and was intubated.
He had a CT of the head and was found to have a large right sided IPH, with some extension in the ventricle and a hint of blood in the fourth ventricle.
He was not reversed at this point and sent to [**Hospital1 18**]  Here he was reversed with factor 9 and FFP and given vitamin K.  His exam was notable for bilateral fixed (but surgical pupils), no right corneal reflex, extensor posturing with both arms and triple flexing with both legs.
He had a repeat head CT which showed a large increase in the size of the bleed, with 1.6cm of shift and possible uncal herniation.
Neurosurgery was made aware and felt this was catastrophic bleed and not amenable to surgery.
Past Medical History: - HTN - A.fib - DM II - gait disorder unspecified - polyuria   Social History: Lives with his wife, daughter and daughter's family.
No tob/etoh/drugs    Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: Initial exam in the ED Physical Exam: Vitals: T:96.1  P:62  R: 16  BP:132/105  SaO2:100 General: Intubated, sedated but bucking vent HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
Patient was unresponsive Pupils were 6 mm bilaterally and nonreactive to light No spontaneous breathing No heart sounds  Patient was pronounced dead at 19:20  Pertinent Results: CT brain [**11-18**]  IMPRESSION:  1.
Markedly increase in massive expanding right frontoparietal intraparenchymal hematoma, now with massive hematoma replacing the mid brain and pons extending to the lateral ventricles and fourth ventricle.
Increased adjacent edema and mass effect with marked transtentorial and peritonsillar herniation which increased since prior study of [**2177-11-17**].
Increased obstructive hydrocephalus.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient admitted on [**2177-11-17**] with known right massive intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.
The hemorrhage extended into the midbrain and pons - thus, this was not a lesion from which the patient had a chance of making a meaningful neurologic recovery.
