Resection of left atrial appendage.
History of Present Illness: 67 year old female with known mitral valve prolapse and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation who presents today for surgical evaluation for possible mitral valve repair vs replacement.
The patient is asymptomatic except for a brief single episode of chest discomfort accompanied by dyspnea.
Referred for Mitral Valve Replacement.

Pertinent Results: [**2158-4-6**] Echo: Pre-bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There was trace tricuspid regurgitation initially, but the patient developed atrial fibrillation and tricuspid regurgitation to 2+.
There is a bioprosthetic valve well-seated in the mitral position with good leaflet excursion.
Immediately post-bypass there was trace paravalvular and transvalvular regurgitation.
The trace transvalvular regurgitation persisted and is eccentric with an anteriorly dirrected jet.
Left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF 30-39%).
All other findings consistent with pre-bypass findings.
Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated without difficulty.
Post-operatively she had episodes of atrial fibrillation and received beta-blockers and Amiodarone.
She  was started on Coumadin and dosage titrated for therapeutic INR >2.0 for atrial fibrillation.
