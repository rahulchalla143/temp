Left frontal cortical and subcortical hypodensity is consistent with a chronic infarct.
The ventricles and cerebral sulci are prominent, compatible with age-related volume loss.
Periventricular areas of hypoattenuation likely reflect chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There are no concerning osseous lesions.
The right common carotid artery measures 5mm at the skull base and 4.5mm at the at the bifurcation.
The left common carotid artery is occluded, with tapering stenosis approximately 1 cm distal to the bifurcation, extending to the level of its terminus, where it is reconstituted through the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
The axial source images suggest an intimal flap raising the possibility of underlying spontaneous dissection.
The left external carotid artery contains thrombus and is virtually occluded approximately 3.5cm from the common carotid bifurcation (4:187).
Calcifications of the cavernous segments of the internal carotid arteries, right greater than left are mild.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized and aerated.
There are no concerning osseous lesions.
Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is incompletely imaged.
No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
Chronic left frontal infarct.
Tapered occlusion of the left internal carotid artery from 1 cm distal to the bifurcation to the level of its terminus; this may be acute, and the morphology raises the possiblity of underlying spontaneous dissection.
Occlusion of the left ECA from approximately 3.5cm from the common carotid bifurcation, which may relate to underlying dissection.
CT [**2193-5-15**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or large vascular territorial infarction.
A hypodense region within the left frontal lobe, most compatible with a subacute infarct, is unchanged in appearance.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is no acute fracture.
IMPRESSION: No new acute changes in comparison to the prior CT examination from earlier today.
MRI [**2193-5-15**] 9:00pm: FINDINGS: There is decreased diffusion throughout virtually the entire left middle cerebral artery distribution with minimal corresponding FLAIR signal abnormality.
There is no hemorrhagic transformation.
Susceptibility artifact is present within the distal left internal carotid artery as well as the proximal M1 segment on the left.
No right hemispheric infarct is identified.
There are otherwise scattered T2 hyperintensities throughout the  supratentorial white matter, with old post-ischemic encephalomalacia within the anterior left frontal lobe.
No flow void is present within the intracranial left internal carotid artery.
MRA: The intracranial right internal carotid artery is normal, as is the right middle cerebral artery and the anterior cerebral arteries.
There is no flow related enhancement within the intracranial left internal carotid artery, nor significantly within the left middle cerebral artery.
There is no identifiable flow related enhancement within the posterior communicating artery on the left.
IMPRESSION: Acute infarct involving virtually the entire left middle cerebral artery distribution associated with what likely represents acute occlusion of the left internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries.
CT [**2193-5-16**]: There has been interval evolution of the large left MCA territory infarct visualized on MRI.
Now there is a large area of hypoattenuation in the left frontoparietal and occipital cortex, with effacement of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter differentiation, compatible with cytotoxic edema associated with evolving infarction.
A relatively more hypoattenuating focus in the left inferior frontal lobe could be and concomitant region of infarction with an older age/subacute etiology.
There is no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
There is no significant mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Hyperdense appearance of the terminal portion of the left internal carotid artery is noted.
There is known left ICA occlusion on the basis of recent CTA.
There is mild anterior ethmoid air cell mucosal thickening.
Evolving large left MCA territory infarct without evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
No significant mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo with afib on Coumadin initially presenting with episode of confusion and possible right sided weakness and left eye visual loss.
His exam was first only  remarkable for encephalopathy with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was found to have a left ICA and a left ECA occlusion.
There may have been an underlying left carotid dissection.
He was now noted to have a very large, nearly complete MCA infarct.
A follow up CT confirmed the finding and showed a hyperdense MCA on the left.
The patient was then noted to have extensor posturing on the right upper extremity and triple flexion on the right lower extremity.
The patient's Coumadin was stopped out of concern for hemorrhagic conversion.
Neuro - the patient had a large, nearly complete left MCA infarct - his BP was allowed to auto regulate and he was kept on frequent neuro checks out of concern for edema - he had a follow up CT on [**2193-4-17**] which showed some edema at this site of the stroke but no significant shift - the patient became more awake and alert, although would not follow commands  CV - the patient was allowed to auto regulate, he was placed back on his home dose of metoprolol for rate control.
He developed a pneumonia.
