[**2130-6-13**] PSIF T2-T11   History of Present Illness: 54 yoF w/ a h/o IDDM, CAD s/p CABG in [**2128**], CHF with an EF of 30% s/p ICD plcmt who initially presented to [**Hospital3 2568**] on [**4-24**] with a complaint of R sided back pain (sudden onset, R mid back pain, worsened with coughing) and shortness of breath, as well as a few weeks of increasing lower extremity edema.
Her BNP was noted to be 2700 and the thought was this was a CHF exacerbation (or possibly pneumonia given cough) so she was treated with levaquin and diuresed.
An initial CT of the chest showed mild angulation of the thoracic spine as well as multilobar pneumonia, so the patient was started on vanc in addition to her levaquin.
Her admission was complicated by MRSA bacteremia and the patient was started on vancomycin.
A repeat CT of the spine on [**5-20**] revealed major thoracic kyphosis and compression, in addition she was noted to have an fluid collection (possible abscess) extending along the soft tissue pre vertebral surface from T7-T9.
Of note this abscess abuts the thoracic aorta.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient has "severe" back pain to R of midline of her mid back, it radiates to her abdomen.
no paresthesias or anesthesia.
She denies weakness in lower ext.
She had a foley place today, but prior had no urinary retention.
No bowel incontinence.
No upper ext neurologic sx or other complaints.
No chest pain.

[**2130-5-24**]  Compression fracture of the vertebral body of T7 is visualized without evidence of retropulsion or spinal cord compression.
Soft tissue density and mass effect is visualized in the paravertebral soft tissues at this level with some low-density areas suggesting necrotic changes, the possibility of a paravertebral mass is a consideration; however, an abscess cannot be completely excluded, this is a limited examination without contrast.
Bilateral ground-glass opacities, pleural effusion, and plate-like atelectasis are noted.
Severe compression deformity of T7, with paravertebral abscess, surrounding the aorta, and possibly extending into the left pleural space.
The extent of bilateral pleural effusions, partially loculated on the left as well as bilateral parenchymal opacities have slightly increased, when compared to the prior study.
Mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
Thickened appearance of the esophagus with an air-fluid level.
CT MYELOGRAM T-SPINE [**2130-6-7**] IMPRESSION:  Compression deformity with moderate-to-severe spinal stenosis and borderline cord compression at the T7 vertebral level.
Additionally, there is extensive inflammatory soft tissue changes at the T7 level with decreased contrast transit time during real-time myelography.
Osteonecrosis without associated acute inflammation.
There were frequent bursts of generalized slowing that usually correlated with respiratory or swallowing artifact by video observation.
There was also extensive muscle and other artifact obscuring large portions of the background.
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the profoundly  suppressed background rhythms such that no activity of definitely cortical origin could be seen.
This suggests a severe encephalopathy.
Anoxia is one possible cause.
The recording cannot be judged as completely without brain activity because of the prominent background artifact.
No epileptiform features were evident.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2130-6-14**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis and infero-lateral/apical akinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**11-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2130-6-29**] - no significant change from [**2130-6-14**]  PORTABLE CHEST [**2130-7-9**] AT 05:20 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study there is no significant interval change with continued demonstration of distended pulmonary vasculature, cardiomegaly and blunted CP angle.
No new consolidations and no PTX.

# Osteo T7 w/ associated Abscess: Pt initially presented with back pain and found to have MRSA bacteremia, subsequently seeding an already present T7 compression fracture, leading to osteomyelitis and paraspinal abscess.
On transfer pt appeared to have no neurological compromise, and was monitored closely with q4h neuro checks.
Several days after transfer pt began having weakness of R hip flexor, with spared distal strength and sensation.
Pt also described extreme pain in the posterior leg, but had negative doppler US.
Weakness progressed to involve entire right lower extremity, followed by left lower extremity over the course of 2 weeks.
Of note, pt's strength exam was very inconsistent and thought to possibly have a component of lack of effort as she did not move on command but was able to withdraw from pain/Babinski.
14 days after transfer pt had episode of fecal incontinence.
Pt received multiple imaging studies including spine CT without contrast, spine CT with contrast, chest/abd/pelvis CT with contrast, EMG, bone scan and tagged WBC.
All showed stable osteomyelitis with associated paraspinal abscess and no visible process that would explain lower extremity symptoms.
On [**2130-6-7**] she developed acute worsening of neurologic status such that she had no motor function in bilateral legs.
Posterior spinal fusion was planned but unable to be completed due to hemodynamic instability in the OR.
Immediately postoperatively, she developed a cardiac dysrhythmia and went into cardiac arrest.
All wounds healed well over the course of her time in the SICU.
# Anoxic brain injury.
Postoperatively the patient did not recover her baseline mental status.
Neurology was consulted and EEG was performed which was consistent with anoxic brain injury.
CT head did not reveal any bleed or large infarct.
She required placement of tracheostomy and PEG tube due to persistently depressed mental status on [**2130-6-20**].
At the time of discharge she was able to follow commands midline and with bilateral upper extremities.
# Acute renal failure: Pt's creatinine rose on [**5-4**] from baseline of 1.2-1.5 and peaked on [**5-10**] at 4.9.
Etiology was believed to be prerenal vs HSP (pt had developed new rash.
Pt continued to be hypervolemic and required Furosemide 120mg IV BID and Chlorothiazide 500mg IV BID to continue negative fluid balance.
Pt developed alkalosis with aggressive diuresis but was monitored closely and continued on the diuresis.
Renal failure remained stable postoperatively.
# Rash: Petechial rash on hands thought to be HSP per outside hospital records.
Pt underwent biopsy at [**Hospital3 2568**], with nonspecific results not ruling out Henoch Schlonlein Purpura.
# CHF: Pt known to have ischemic CHF with EF 30-35%.
# Pneumonia: Patient initially admitted and treated for pneumonia at [**Hospital3 2568**].
Her WBC count was 19,000 and she had a R sided pleural effusion requiring chest tube.
Since transfer pt had been afebrile, had normal WBC count, and CXR showed small persistent effusions but consolidation resolved.
Postoperatively, she required ventilator support due to her altered mental status as noted above.
She developed ventilator associated pneumonia and completed a 10 day course of Meropenem.
At the time of discharge she is able to tolerate 2 hour intervals of trach collar and is otherwise requiring CPAP with minimal settings.
