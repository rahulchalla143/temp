HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This 79 year old woman with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft and aortic valve replacement and history of diverticulosis presents to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 69**] with complaints of abdominal pain as well as nausea and vomiting.
She reports that she has been having vague abdominal complaints with periodic vomiting for several months.
Over this time, she has experienced an approximately fifteen pounds of weight loss.
She had sudden worsening of her symptoms since last night including periumbilical pain with no radiation, multiple episodes of emesis (over 10 since last night).
She reports that her emesis is non-bloody and non-bilious.
She is having no diarrhea or constipation, no bright red blood per rectum and no melena.
No fever or chills.
She reports that she has had a longstanding history of anemia that has been worked up but no source found.
She has a history of coronary artery disease status post stent placement during a [**2168**] catheterization.
She had an aortic valve replacement for bicuspid valve performed during that second coronary artery bypass graft.
History of congestive heart failure with [**Month (only) 958**] echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 30 to 40%.
Three to four plus mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
She has a history of carotid stenosis status post a left carotid endarterectomy in [**2168**] and a right carotid endarterectomy in [**2162**].
She has dry mucous membranes but a clear oropharynx.
She had jugular venous distention noted at 8 to 9.
Her heart was a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs noted on initial examination.
She had occasional crackles at her bases.
The patient was unable to lie flat secondary to active nausea and vomiting.
She had some slight right upper quadrant tenderness noted on examination.
She had no guarding or rebound at that time.
LABORATORY:  Initial labs showed her CBC with a white blood cell count of 7.9, hematocrit of 39, and platelet count of 182.
An EKG was performed which showed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with some left ventricular hypertrophy noted but no ST changes.
An abdominal CT scan was performed at the request of the Emergency Department staff on the 4th which showed a mid to distal small bowel obstruction.
No mass lesion was identified by imaging.
There was no evidence of free fluid or free air.
There was a left adnexal cystic lesion that appeared unchanged with prior study.
Sigmoid diverticulosis was noted without any evidence of diverticulitises and there was evidence of cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was also acquired while the patient was in the Emergency Department which also showed cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Surgical Service for management of a partial high grade small bowel obstruction.
diet a few days later but did not tolerate liquids and had increasing distention, nausea and vomiting despite passing flatus.
Small bowel follow through performed revealed dilated loops of small bowel and slow transit of contrast.
The most likely etiology of her high grade partial small bowel obstruction was assumed to be adhesions from prior abdominal surgeries.
An EKG performed showed new ST elevations in V2 and V3 and although CK and CK MB were normal, her peak troponin was 0.64.
She had no chest pain or shortness of breath heart rate this episode.
Cardiology felt after evaluating the patient that the source of her hypotension was not cardiac in origin.
She was also found to have a positive urine culture at that time with pan sensitive enterococcus and there was some question as to whether or not urosepsis might have contributed to her episode of hypotension that had her moved to the Unit.
A shock assessment with a Swan-Ganz was attempted while she was in the unit, but interpretation of the numbers was made difficult by her large mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
The team at that time felt that infection was a more likely cause of her shock than cardiogenic.
Once the sensitivities returned on the enterococcus, she was maintained on Levaquin to cover her urinary tract infection as well as this question of possible pulmonary infiltrate seen on the chest x-ray.
From an Endocrine perspective, she had a cortisol stimulation in the Intensive Care Unit which showed adrenal insufficiency so she was put on a seven day replacement course of hydrocortisone and flutocortisone.
She was taken off total parenteral nutrition while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit as her small bowel obstruction seemed to be resolved and she was tolerating p.o.
and feeling well with no abdominal pain and no nausea or vomiting.
She had significant volume overload from her stay in the Intensive Care Unit and the resuscitation that she received there.
This was problem[**Name (NI) 115**] secondary to bad mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation as well as poor ejection fraction of 20%.
However, other cardiac medicines were titrated up in order to give her good blood pressure and rate control as well as to attempt mild diuresis to remove some of the fluid given in the unit.
Also, a formal congestive heart failure consultation was called on the patient in order to optimize medication regimens as well as hook her into care upon discharge.
A chest x-ray was ordered which showed no evidence of pneumonia and improved congestive heart failure pattern.
A KUB was ordered which was consistent with partial small bowel obstruction with scattered fluid levels but no free air.
She was on Levaquin still for her enterococcal urinary tract infection at the time of this white count jump, so clindamycin was added to broaden coverage.
No evidence of infection was found on these studies, however, over the next day or so, the patient began to have episodes of nausea, vomiting and increasing abdominal girth.
There was concern that there was a recurrence of her small bowel obstruction so she was placed on n.p.o.
and intravenous fluids were restarted with the plan to drop an nasogastric tube if emesis persistent.
She was advanced to sips on the 28th but developed repeated episodes of emesis and returned to n.p.o.
A repeat KUB showed some stool, raising concern that this was constipation versus an small bowel obstruction and she was given several enemas with some small bowel movements and passing flatus and decreasing distention as a result.
Antibiotics were discontinued on the 30th secondary to there being no evidence for active infection.
She was managed for the presumed recurrence of her small bowel obstruction versus constipation.
