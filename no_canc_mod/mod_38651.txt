Admission Date:  [**2127-11-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2127-11-25**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, known coronary artery disease, and aortic stenosis, status post a coronary artery bypass graft in [**2122**], secondary to three vessel disease, who presented with increased shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion times several months.
He denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
There was increased orthopnea and peripheral edema.
He denied chest pain or palpitations.
The patient had an echocardiogram in [**2127-7-4**], which was done as part of aortic stenosis screening, which revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction of 60%, with transvalvular mean pressure of 65 and aortic valve area of 0.45.
Repeat echocardiogram on [**2127-10-17**], revealed dilated left atrium and right atrium, ejection fraction of 55%, mean gradient of 92 and a valve area of 0.5 centimeter squared.
Due to these symptoms and aortic stenosis, the patient was referred for cardiac catheterization, which he underwent on [**2127-1-19**], which revealed an aortic valve gradient of 35.8 and a valve area of 0.64.
Additionally, the catheterization revealed his native three vessel disease and additionally an occlusion of the left anterior descending distal to the touchdown of his saphenous vein graft and an 80% stenosis in the proximal obtuse marginal three.
The patient was admitted to the CCU for observation and diuresis, as well as workup for possible redo coronary artery bypass graft/aortic valve replacement.
Coronary artery disease.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Prior E. coli bacteremia.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Status post lumbar laminectomy complicated by urinary retention which is now resolved in [**2122**].
Status post bilateral hernia repair.
Coronary artery bypass graft.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient was in no acute distress.
Elevated jugular venous pressure to the angle of the jaw.
There was a II/VI crescendo decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border.
The extremities showed chronic venous stasis changes.
LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 70 beats per minute, normal axis, slightly long Q-Tc, peaked T waves in II, III, V2, V3 and V4, upsloping ST elevation in V2.
Cardiac catheterization [**2127-11-18**], showed worsening native disease, patent grafts with an occluded left anterior descending distal to the touchdown of the saphenous vein graft, 80% stenosis in the proximal obtuse marginal three, two serial 90% stenoses in the obtuse marginal two proximal to the saphenous vein graft touchdown.
Chest x-ray from [**2127-11-13**], showed mild congestive heart failure.
Congestive heart failure - The patient had a preserved ejection fraction but it was felt his severe aortic stenosis was leading to his dyspnea on exertion and his congestive heart failure by evidence of his elevated wedge on catheterization.
During his stay in the CCU, the patient diuresed greater than five liters negative with resolution of his lower extremity edema.
Although his pulmonary artery diastolic number never reached 20, it was felt based on the resolution of his edema and the evidence of hemoconcentration on his laboratory values that the patient had been adequately diuresed.
Aortic stenosis - In terms of the patient's critical aortic stenosis leading to his congestive heart failure, a CT surgery consultation was obtained for the question of aortic valve replacement.
At the time of his discharge, the patient was leaning towards not opting for the surgery understanding that he would likely have continued problems with shortness of breath, fluid overload.
Ischemia - The patient had no chest pain while he was in the hospital, however, he did have worsening coronary artery disease by evidence of his catheterization and, if he had opted for the aortic valve replacement, he would likely also undergo a redo coronary artery bypass graft.
Rhythm -  The patient with chronic atrial fibrillation.
The patient did have one thirteen beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia which was asymptomatic.
Anemia - The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells and started on iron replacement for iron deficiency anemia.
Gastrointestinal - The patient had some hemorrhoidal bleeding while on the Heparin drip treated with local care.
He was continued on H2 blocker for peptic ulcer disease.
Congestive heart failure secondary to aortic stenosis.
Aortic stenosis.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
