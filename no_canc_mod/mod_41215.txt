EMS reports witnessed tonic-clonic seizure.
He c/o pain in his chest and the front of his head.
His daughter stated that he c/o a headache yesterday and called his doctor [**First Name (Titles) 1023**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8757**] him to present to the ED at the local hospital.
He presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital and underwent an imaging study of the head which reportedly showed a sinus infection.
He continues with c/o chest pain and a headache localized to the front of the head.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Strength full power [**5-31**] throughout with the exception of decreased grip strength on the left.
No pronator drift.
Diffuse subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Cerebral edema with sulcal effacement sparing the vertex.
Wide-necked, broad-based saccular aneurysm of the left lateral wall of the proximal basilar artery, with the aneurysm neck measuring 5 mm, and transverse basilar diameter of 5 mm.
Mild circumferential narrowing of the distal left vertebral artery just proximal to the basilar origin.
Patchy ground-glass opacities in the imaged upper lungs, compatible with edema, infection or hemorrhage.
Recommend correlation with chest radiography.
CT head [**9-16**] IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of a right frontal approach external ventricular drain with interval decrease in size of the lateral and third ventricles with persistent extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular blood.
Cerebral angiogram [**9-16**] FINDINGS: The left vertebral artery arteriogram re-demonstrates the presence of a fusiform short segment dissecting basilar aneurysm with an exophytic component measuring 2 - 3 mm in diameter.
Given associated inhomogeneous narrowing and partial filling defect of the proximal basilar segment, the aneurysmatic dilatation most likely represents a pseudoaneurysm in the setting of basilar artery dissection.
There is no evidence of active extravasation.
The right common carotid arteriogram demonstrates no significant abnormality.
The left common carotid arteriogram demonstrates no significant abnormality.
IMPRESSION: Aneurysmatic dilatation of the vertebrobasilar junction with associated irregular narrowing and minimal filling defect of the proximal segment, most likely representing pseudoaneurysm in the setting of dissection.
Again seen is diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage.
Interval increase in size of the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle, especially the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles with increased effacement of the sulci, which is concerning for hydrocephalus.
Thinner appearance of the intracerebral arteries suggesting mild vasospasm  ECHO [**9-17**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Continued diffuse vasospasm, stable since the prior study, worst in the basilar artery.
Redistributed/evolved diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.
Also, subdural hemorrhage layering along the tentorium and falx.
Fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the proximal basilar artery, unchanged from prior studies.
[**9-23**] LENIs - no DVT  [**9-25**] - [**9-25**]: CTA: -Possible change in shape of the basilar artery aneurysm is concerning for further intending hemorrhage.
Worsening focal stenosis of the dominant left vertebral artery at two places.
Worsening diffuse cerebrovascular vasospasm distal to the aneurysm.
No new hemorrhage identified.
[**9-27**] Portable abdomen- FINDINGS:  There are dilated gas-filled loops of both large and small bowel, most likely reflecting an adynamic ileus pattern related to the diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.
New left lung base consolidation compatible with early pneumonia or atelectasis with associated left-sided pleural effusion.
[**10-3**] CT Head: There has been interval improvement/resolution of the subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage when compared to the prior study.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage or acute vascular territorial infarction.
There is evidence of air in the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] at the site of the ventriculostomy catheter tract.
[**10-7**] CXR: Previous mediastinal and pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate cardiomegaly have all improved.
The heart is now only mildly enlarged.
There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
There is no radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
[**10-8**] CT head: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or large acute territorial infarction.
BONES:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
IMPRESSION:  No hydrocephalus.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The degree of ventricular dilatation is unchanged, with further asymmetric prominence of all components of the right lateral ventricle, as on prior studies, likely congenital/developmental  [**2166-10-9**]: LENS - neg for DVT.
Interval removal of the EVD with a small amount of pneumocephalus and intraparenchymal hemorrhage at the tract; however, no other evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect or acute infarction.
Unchanged size and shape of the ventricles; no evidence of hydrocephalus.
Overall unchanged or improvement of the caliber of vessels without evidence of worsening vasospasm.

A wide neck basilar artery aneurysm was visualized, but no intervention took place at that time.
On [**9-17**]: Cervical Spine imaging report was reviewed which did not show a fracture in the Cervical spine and patient's Hard Collar was removed after examination which involved range of motion testing.
He also underwent CTA of the head which showed mild vasospasm but didn't require intervention.
On [**9-22**], a CTA was done which showed stable SAH and decreased IVH, but diffused vasospasm.
He complained of headaches and his ICPs went up to 24.
On [**9-25**]: Decreased Na and thus we increased salt tabs to 2gm TID.
Repeat CTA preliminary read persistent diffuse vasospasm, particularly within the basilar artery as seen  on the prior study from [**9-22**].
No new hemorrhage.
His WBC was trending up, despite remaining afebrile so a urine and blood cx were sent.
His urine was + for enterococcus so he was started on antibiotics.
On [**9-30**] the patient complained of chest pain.
CSF was sent for microbio and culture.
Vancomycin covers his CSF and UTI at this time.
He received his last dose of intrathecal vancomycin on [**10-6**] and will continue on IV vancomycin.
CT head was performed on [**10-8**] after 24 hours of clamping the drain, there was no hydrocephalus and the EVD was removed.
He was doing well without any neurologic decline or worsening headaches on [**10-9**].
He had bilateral lower extremity doppler US which were negative for DVT.
Follow up CTA showed unchanged size and shape of the saccular aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery distal to the vertebrobasilar junction, no evidence of spasm.
He complained of intermittent headache and head pressure.
At the time of discharge on [**10-13**] he was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating without difficulty, afebrile with stable vital signs.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Known firstname **] in 2 weeks with a repeat cerebral Angiogram.
