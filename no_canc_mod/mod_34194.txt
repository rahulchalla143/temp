Brief Hospital Course: 28 year old female presenting with agitation and tachycardia with known GBL use, presemted with GBL withdrawl.
Pt's severe anxiety and significant tachycardia were likely due to significant GBL withdrawl.
She was managed with a CIWA scale, however this did not seem to adequately capture her symptoms of withdrawl, which included anxiety and tachycardia primarily, but also included sweats and occas palpitations.
As pt seems to have significant anxiety at baseline, and pt claimed to be self-medicating for anxiety, Psychiatry was consulted for assistance.
Pt had significant improvement in symptoms with scheduled valium, and her withdrawl symptoms gradually decreased.
Her tachycardia appeared to be the most consistent sign of her withdrawl, and at the time of discharge, her tachycardia had resolved.
No stigmata of chronic liver disease.
