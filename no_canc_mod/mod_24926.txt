Multilevel degenerative changes, most pronounced at C5/C6 and C6/C7 which can predispose to cord injury in the setting of trauma.
If indicated an MRI could be performed  [**2108-9-27**]:  cat scan of head:   IMPRESSION: Mild parenchymal atrophy and chronic small vessel disease but no acute intracranial findings  [**2108-9-27**]:  chest x-ray:  IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly but no acute cardiopulmonary process  [**2108-9-27**]: Pelvis and hip x-ray:  AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS, TWO VIEWS OF THE LEFT FEMUR: There are mildly displaced right superior and inferior pubic rami fractures.
Additionally, cortical irregularity involving the left acetabulum medially as well as the left inferior pubic ramus is suspicious for mildly displaced fractures.
Subtle linear lucency involving the left sacral ala is worrisome for a non-displaced fracture.
No dislocation seen.
Extensive vascular calcifications are present.
There are moderate degenerative changes of both hips with joint space narrowing.
Pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joints are not diastatic.
No bladder leak.
Two probable pelvic pseudoaneurysms on the left at site of ramus and acatabular fracture.
Unchanged appearance to extraperitoneal hyperdense material suggestive of hematoma   4.
Complex pelvic fractures stable since prior examination, including bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami, medial left acetabulum, left sacral ala, and posterior left iliac bone.
No new fractures.
Cystic structure in the anterior mediastinum, probable thymic cyst.
Complex ulcerated plaque in the distal aorta  [**2108-9-27**]:  arteriogram:  IMPRESSION: Areas of abnormal arterial anatomy in branches arising from the left internal iliac artery.
There is no evidence of gross extravasation.
The arterial irregularity may represent small pseudoaneurysms or contusional injury following trauma.
No previous tracing available for comparison  [**2108-9-29**]:  EKG:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Since the previous tracing of [**2108-9-28**] ventricular rate is slower and ST-T wave abnormalities have decreased.
Modest low amplitude T wave changes.
TRACING #3  [**2108-10-1**]:  EKG:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2108-9-30**] atrial fibrillation has replaced sinus rhythm and further ST-T wave changes are present.
TRACING #4  [**2108-10-1**]:  chest x-ray:  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including tortuous aorta and mild cardiomegaly.
Thickening of the costophrenic angle on the right versus small amount of pleural effusion is noted  [**2108-10-1**]:  Chest x-ray:  FINDINGS: The lungs are normal in appearance without evidence of pneumonia or effusion.
The anterior mediastinal mass is best visualized on the CT of [**2108-9-27**] and is not well seen on the lateral radiograph due to rotation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
He was found to have non-operative bilateral pelvic fractures.
The cat scan of the torso was suggestive of active hemorrhage or pseudo-aneurysm from internal pudental artery.
He did develop an acute onset of atrial fibrillation with a rapid rate.
He continues to alternate between normal sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation.
He was also found to have a urinary tract infection and has been started on a 3 day course of ciprofloxacin.
He will also need to schedule an appointment with his primary care provider this week to discuss further managment of his atrial fibrillation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor Last Name **] Green Nursing & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Multiple left pelvic fractures Two pseudoaneurysms left pelvic sidewall Right superior and inferior pubic rami fracture   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You are being discharged from the hospital after you fell off a later and sustained a pelvic fracture.
Please follow these instructions:  call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have any of the following:    * You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or  tightness.
* New or worsening cough or wheezing.
