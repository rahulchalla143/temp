Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT abdomen and pelvis ([**3-10**]): FINDINGS: Evaluation of the lung bases demonstrates bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
A calcified stone and sludge are identified within the gallbladder.
There is no evidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The pancreas is slightly fatty replaced, but otherwise unremarkable.
No adrenal lesions are present.
There is a 4.6 cm exophytic cyst in the left kidney.
No other renal masses are identified.
The kidneys enhance symmetrically and are without evidence of perinephric stranding or hydronephrosis.
There are no dilated loops of small bowel to suggest an obstruction.
Scattered left sided and sigmoid diverticula are present without evidence of diverticulitis.
Note is made of atherosclerotic calcifications and a clacified splenic artery aneurysm.
Evaluation of the deep pelvis is slightly limited due to artifact from the indwelling bilateral hip arthroplasties.
No discrete fluid collection is identified.
Evaluation of the bone windows demonstrates no osseous blastic or lytic lesions.
Degenerative changes are present throughout the spine.
An area of soft tissue density is identified with in the atrophied left paraspinous muscles of L5-S1.
It is nonspecific and may represent post-surgical changes.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
No intra-abdominal fluid collections are identified to suggest an abscess.
Evaluation of the deep pelvis is slightly limited as described above.
There is no appreciable plaque or wall thickening involving either carotid system.
IMPRESSION: Widely patent common and internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 73 y/o female with PMH significant for HTN, previous TIAs, and hypercholesterolemia admitted through ED on [**3-6**] following an episode of slred speech and lip paresthesias.
MRI was negative for acute CVA.
On the morning of [**3-7**], the pt had an episode of nausea and vomiting followed by increased work of breathing and decrease in SBP to the 60s.
CTA was negative for PE but showed bilateral consollidations concerning for aspiration PNA.
Respiratory failure- Pt experienced an episode of respiratory failure on [**3-7**].
This occurred following an episode of nausea and vomiting.
At that time, the pt developed increased work of breathing and tachypnia.
CXR showed florid CHF so the pt was diuresed with lasix 40 mg IV and started on a nitro drip.
She was also started on pressors for her hypotension at that time.
A CTA was concerned given a concern for PE but this was negative.
Imaging did show bilateral lower lobe infiltrates consistent with probable aspiration PNA.
Pt was extubated without problem on [**3-11**].
Blood cultures have been negative to date and sputum cultures grew only oropharyngeal flora.
Of note, pt had bedside swallow eval on [**3-11**] which she passed without difficulty.
No further choking epsisodes with eating.
[**Name (NI) **] Pt with probable aspiration PNA as above.
In addition, pt developed rigoring, transient leukopenia, and hypertension in the MICU on [**3-10**].
At that time, she was experiencing severe back and leg pain.
A CT was obtained that diverticulosis and fluid at L4-L5 of the spinal processes.
However, there were no findings thought to account for her symtpoms.
A TTE was obtained to evaluate for possible valvular disease/endocarditis.
It showed no significant abnormality and no vegitation.
As the pt remained afebrile on the floor with negative blood cultures and no new murmer, a TEE was not obtained.
[**Name (NI) **] Pt was hypotensive in the MICU in settion of probable aspiration PNA/concern for SIRS.
Neuro- On admission, pt had transient dysarthria and facial numbness most probably due to a TIA.
Head CT and MRI were negative for evidence of acute infarct.
Carotid US was obtained [**3-12**] which showed widely patent arteries.
TIA may have been in setting of poorly controlled hypertension.
As pt had this episode and has had TIAs in the past, an appointment was made for her to follow up with neurology following discharge.
[**Name (NI) 3674**] Pt with slow trend down of Hct over admission but stable over last few days.
Disp:*30 Tablet Sustained Release 24HR(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia  Secondary diagnosis: Respiratory failure Hypotension in setting of PNA Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia TIAs   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Seek medical attention for chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, inability to eat, or any other concerning symtpoms.
