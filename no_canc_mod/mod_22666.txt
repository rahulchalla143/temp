Admission Date:  [**2167-4-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-4-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-8-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**] Chief Complaint: presented to outside hospital with worsening chronic chest pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization, and admitted to the CCU for persistent chest pain post cath.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with 2 drug eluting stents to left anterior descending artery   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 85934**] is a 46 year old male with hypertension and hyperlipidemia but no coronary history who has had chest pain on and off for the past year over the left percordium.
He notes that over the past two weeks he has had increased frequency of chest pain with exertion that occurs every other day.
On [**2167-4-21**], while at work he developed worsening chest pain after walking up a flight of stairs that radiated down his left arm and was associated with nausea, anxiety, and dyspnea.
He presented to the [**Hospital1 2436**] ED where he received 2 SL nitroglycerin tabs and became chest pain free.
EKG showed NSR 76 bpm, < [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in II and III, no t wave inversions.
Here, he underwent cardiac catheterization which showed: 3 vessel disease with a 85% long lesion in the LAD, a distal 60% LCx lesion, and total proximal PDA occlusion with collaterals from the LAD.
However, a PCI of the RPDA was thought to be difficult due to severe tortuousity of the RCA.
The patient continued to have persistent chest pain after the procedure and appeared unwell.
He also complained of back pain and had blood pressure in the 200s.
He also complains of back ache that is consistent with his chronic back pain that he beleives is musculoskeletal.
Dyslipidemia 2.
Hypertension 3. left knee ligament repair 4. rectal bleed secondary to hemorrhoids   Social History: SOCIAL HISTORY: Works as a recruiter, married to RN at [**Hospital1 18**].
-Tobacco history: none -ETOH: social, couple drinks once a week -Illicit drugs: none   Family History: dyslipidemia in parents, mother with ovarian cancer, father with parkinson's disease.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with no elevated JVP CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a long lesion in the proximal/mid vessel to 80%.
There was a total occlusion proximally of the PDA which filled via LAD collaterals with probable diffuse disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated central aortic pressures of 149/98 mmHg.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 85934**] is a 46 YOM with hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] with an NSTEMI   * NSTEMI:  The patient was chest pain free on arrival and had evidence of elevated biomarkers indicating NSTEMI.
He was taken for cardiac catheterization and was found to have 3 vessel disease.
The procedure had no complications, however, afterward he developed recurrent chest pain with hypertension (see below).
He became chestpain free after starting a nitro drip.
* Chest/back pain:  Following his catheterization, the patient developed chest discomfort and also complained of back pain.
The initial concern was for aortic dissection because of the back pain in the setting of hypertension to the 200s so the patient was admitted to the CCU for further monitoring and management.
He denied any new back pain beyond his baseline chronic musculoskeletal back pain.
Causes for the persistent chest discomfort were thought to be from ongoing ischemia, microembolization from the stents, or pain from manipulation and stenting of the LAD.
He was started on nitro drip for hypertensive urgency and he became chest pain free and had SBPs in the high 120s.
* Hyperlipidemia:  The patient's lipid profile revealed elevated lipids with LDL 171, HDL 31, tryglycerides 258, and total cholesterol 254.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet Sublingual every 5 minutes for total of 3 doses as needed for chest pain: If you still have chest pain after 3 doses, call 911.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Hypertension Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and required 2 drug eluting stents to your left anterior descending artery.
There were no complications and the echocardiogram shwed that your heart function is unchanged.
Tell Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] if you develop a cough on the medicine.
Take nitroglycerin if you have chest pain at home that is similar to your previous chest pain.
If you still have chest pain after 3 doses, call 911.
If you have an upset stomach from the aspirin or Plavix, you can take Zantac 1-2x/day.
