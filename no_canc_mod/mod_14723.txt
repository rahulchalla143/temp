Admission Date:  [**2136-3-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2136-3-31**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-9-19**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARD [**Doctor First Name 147**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year old gentleman who has a history of known coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2121**] and [**2129**], who underwent a PCI stent to the circumflex and right coronary artery in [**2129**].
The patient underwent an exercise treadmill test in [**2135-12-12**] which showed an ejection fraction of 27% and was positive for evidence of ischemia.
The patient presented to his primary care physician with increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion times six months.
Cardiac catheterization showed an left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 30, PA pressures of 69/20, 100% proximal left anterior descending lesion and 100% first diagonal lesion, 100% mid circumflex lesion, 100% obtuse marginal one, 100% right PDA and 100% RPL.
The patient had an echocardiogram done at that time which showed left atrial enlargement and global left ventricular hypokinesis.
No aortic insufficiency, two plus mitral regurgitation, one to two plus tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary artery hypertension and an ejection fraction of 20%.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, diet controlled.
Status post renal cell carcinoma in [**2121**]; status post nephrectomy with a baseline creatinine of 2.0 to 2.1.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for peripheral neuropathy and mild anemia as well as the previously mentioned diverticular disease and diabetes mellitus.
On the first postoperative evening, the patient had a large volume requirement with a progressive acidosis and a worsening lactate.
A General Surgery consultation was obtained and a CT scan was obtained which showed an unremarkable gallbladder, two small granulomas in the right lobe of the liver, some fatty infiltration of the pancreas without enlargement or fat stranding around the pancreas, grossly patent celiac and superior mesentery artery.
Hyper enhancement of the mucosa of the large bowel with generalized edema of the entire colonic wall and a question of pneumatosis in the descending colon, moderate stranding around the cecum and a small amount of free intraperitoneal fluid in the upper pelvis.
With these findings, the General Surgery Team of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was significantly concerned for mesenteric ischemia and the decision was made to take the patient to the Operating Room for an exploratory laparotomy.
The patient was taken on postoperative day number one and intraoperatively there were no findings of ischemic bowel.
The bowel wall was moderately thickened but no evidence of vascular insufficiency was identified.
With these findings, the patient was returned to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition with continued aggressive fluid resuscitation.
The patient had a low level acidosis which resolved with administration of bicarbonate.
The patient also developed some hyperkalemia on postoperative day number two.
The patient's chest tubes which had been placed during the initial operation continued to have significant amount of serous output.
At that time, the patient began complaining of symptoms of vertigo where he felt like the room was spinning.
The symptoms worsened over the course of the day.
The Neurology attending felt that perhaps the patient had some subtle neurologic findings and recommended obtaining an MRI at a future date as the patient could not have an MRI at that time due to the staples on his incisions.
A CT scan obtained showed no acute process and no evidence of a stroke.
During this time, the patient was noted to have intermittently cool and ecchymotic toes and fingers with good pulses.
The patient denied having any experience with the same.
There was no evidence of vascular compromise and when the cyanosis resolved, the digits became red in color.
It was eventually decided that this was possibly a new expression of Raynaud's syndrome.
The patient was also noted to have a decrease in platelet count and heparin antibody was sent which was subsequently negative.
Chest tubes continued to have a moderate amount of serous drainage.
The patient began working with Physical Therapy.
The patient's chest tubes were removed without incident without any evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
On postoperative day number eleven, the patient had been complaining of mild dyspnea on exertion.
Chest x-ray showed small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
The midline incision is healing well.
Sternal incision staples are intact.
There is minimal erythema at the superior aspect of the incision.
There is no drainage from the incision.
There is a minimal amount of serous drainage from the left chest tube site.
Coronary artery disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency and dye induced acute tubular necrosis.
Postoperative vertigo.
Diabetes mellitus.
Congestive heart failure and moderate mitral regurgitaion.
