Father had hypertension and CVA.
No family history of cardiac disease or sudden cardiac death.
No evidence of delirium.
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMD, lower dentures in place Neck: supple, appears elevated but difficult to assess JVD [**2-7**] right IJ HD catheter Lungs: decreased BS R>L, inspiratory crackles, coarse with occasional rhonchi and expiratory wheezes CV: HS distant, RRR, no MRG, nl S1-S2 Abd: NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding Ext: WWP, trace edema, 1+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs), left heel exophytic ulceration Skin: 1x1cm 0.5cm deep sacral decubitus ulcer, no drainage Neuro: awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**5-10**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout  Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission [**2163-7-24**] WBC-6.1 RBC-3.24* Hgb-11.4* Hct-34.1* MCV-105* MCH-35.1* Plt Ct-118* Neuts-75.5* Lymphs-16.1* Monos-4.4 Eos-3.7 Baso-0.3 PT-13.3 PTT-25.7 INR(PT)-1.1 Glucose-91 UreaN-19 Creat-3.8* Na-139 K-7.8* Cl-98 HCO3-31 AnGap-18 Lactate-1.3 freeCa-1.07* .
Other Studies: [**2163-7-24**] EKG: Normal sinus rhythm with intraventricular conduction defect consistent with incomplete right bundle-branch block.
Cannot exclude prior inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2163-7-11**] no diagnostic interim change.
[**2163-7-29**] CXR: In comparison with previous study of [**7-27**], there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with continued small bilateral effusions in a patient with intact sternal sutures and previous CABG and valve replacement.
There is somewhat ill-defined areas of increased opacification at the right base, the right mid zone, and the left base in the retrocardiac region.
[**2163-7-30**] TTE: Suboptimal image quality.
Possible aortic valve vegetation.
Transesophageal echocardiography is recommended to diagnose endocarditis if clinically indicated.
No definite evidence of valvular vegetation.
Well seated mitral annuloplasty ring with moderate mitral regurgitation.
Focal thickening of the aortic valve without aortic regurgitation.
1) Interstitial edema, possibly with small alveolar component 2) Bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
Possibility of a pneumonic infiltrate at the left base cannot be entirely excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 y/o WF with PMH significant for ESRD on HD, systolic CHF with EF 25-30%, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation initially admitted to hospital with CHF exacerbation, now with VISA line related bacteremia (6/6 bottles).
# VISA bacteremia/sepsis: Patient spiked fever on [**7-27**], blood cultures drawn which grew GPCs in pairs and clusters and was intially started on vancomycin.
# Dyspnea/Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Most likely due to acute on chronic systolic heart failure given history, fluid overload on physical exam, and radiographic findings.
Etiology of exacerbation unclear, but may be secondary to infection as above.
[**Date range (3) **] in [**10-13**] showed EF of 25-30% and a repeat [**Date Range 113**] during admission showed severely reduced global systolic function.
Pneumonia was unlikely given lack of cough, fever, leukocytosis, or focal CXR findings.
ACS was unlikely given lack of acute changes on EKG and stable cardiac enzymes.
# CKD/ESRD on HD - Pt has been on dialysis for past 6 months via R Quintin.
# LLE Ulcer:  Patient has been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3407**] for this issue and was actually scheduled to undergo angiography and heel debridement prior to her admission.
Given her multiple medical problems on this admission the angio was postponed and plan is for patient to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3407**] in 2 weeks and reschedule procedure.
# CAD - No active issues on this admission.
BB held in setting of hypotension while septic/bactermic.
Most likely secondary to end stage renal disease.
As noted above, her metoprolol was held given episodes of hypotension in setting of infection.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for foot pain.
Congestive heart failure exacerbation/pulmonary edema 2.
End Stage Renal Disease on hemodyalysis 3.
Vancomycin intermediate staphlococcus aureus bacteremia/sepsis .
Secondary: 1) Coronary Artery Disease 2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since [**8-13**] 3) Mitral valve annuloplasty ([**2163-8-16**]) 4) Hyperlipidemia 5) Hypertension 6) Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting 7) gout 7) diverticulosis 8) depression   Discharge Condition: afebrile, vital signs stable.
Shortness of breath improved with dialysis treatments.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fluid build-up in the lungs causing shortness of breath.
In the hospital, you received dialysis which improved your volume status and shortness of breath.
Your hospital course was complicated by a bloodstream infection with a highly resistant organism, thought to be from an infected hemodialysis line, which was replaced.
You underwent cardiac echocardiography which showed severely reduced heart function.
Please seek medical attention for fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or lower extremity swelling.
