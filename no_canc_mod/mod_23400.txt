History of Present Illness: 57 yo male with history of ESLD [**3-2**] HCV cirrhosis, c/b portal hypertension with resistant ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and recurrent hyponatremia with multiple recent admissions for refractory hyponatremia and volume overload.
On [**6-15**], he was admitted with hyponatremia at which point tolvaptan was increased from 30mg to 60mg and diuretics were held.
He was most recently discharged on [**2185-7-2**] after an admission for volume overload where he was found to have diastolic heart failure as a contributing factor.
In the ED, he was found to have acute kidney injury with creatinine of 1.4, so he was given a single dose of albumin and sent to the floor.
Past Medical History: -HCV (genotype 1) cirrhosis complicated by hyponatremia, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy -obesity -hypertension -Insulin-dependent diabetes -CVA with no residual deficits -dyslipidemia -neuropathy -osteoarthritis of the knees -spinal stenosis w/ disk herniation and disc fragments in the canal resulting in permanent diability and foot drop -right lower extremity nerve impingement.
-PAD -h/o hypomagnesemia -COPD -anxiety -h/o kidney stones -Past heavy ETOH use, quit [**2177**] -s/p right wrist tendon repair after a plate-glass injury [**2154**]  Social History: Lives at home with his children and wife who is his primary caretaker.
On disability for spinal stenosis and chronic back pain.
Family History: Positive for HTN and CAD as well as CVAs.
No family history of liver disease.
NECK: Supple, no cervical LAD.
HEART: RRR, soft S1, systolic murmur radiating to carotids.
SKIN: No rashes or lesions.
Cirrhosis with mild splenomegaly and small volume ascites.
[**2185-7-5**] CXR: There is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which is unchanged.
There has been no interval change in the appearance of mild indistinctness of the pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.
No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
Mild degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo male with hep C cirrhosis presented with hyponatremia, mild confusion, and acute kidney injury, after very recent hospitalization during which he was started on torsemide for mild diastolic heart failure.
Lastly, he removed his PICC line at a time when he was being treated with a continuous furosemide infusion for volume overload.
(His hyponatremia is more likely the result of non-compliance with free water restriction, and it is unlikely that tolvaptan will benefit him as long as he is unable to comply with dietary recommendations).
Simvastatin is likely of little benefit for primary prevention given his overall poor prognosis with end-stage liver disease (MELD 28-29), and this medicine was also held.
This was likely a result of decreased effective circulating volume due to poor oncotic pressure despite total body volume overload.
#Volume overload: Likely a combination of mild diastolic heart failure and cirrhosis in a patient who is non-compliant with sodium restriction.
Diuretics were initially held and then resumed given the degree of his volume overload.
Ultrafiltration was started for volume overload via a right IJ HD line.
He had transient hypotension in the setting of initiating ultrafiltration, requiring levophed briefly.
Patient diuresed well with the lasix drip over 48 hours, net negative 4-5 L.  He was also temporarily placed on low dose dopamine for diuresis, which was discontinued..  Encephalopathy started to clear with liquid lactulose.
Subsequently, he triggered as he became asymptomatically hypotensive to 80/40 with SOB requiring 2L nasal cannula.
#Hyperbilirubinemia: Currently the patient has no signs of a portal vein thrombosis or SBP that would cause the patient's liver disease to decompensate.
No fevers or white count, with all cultures negative to date.
#Hepatic encephalopathy: Most likely secondary to noncompliance with lactulose.
# Elevated lactate: possibly due to impaired clearance of lactate by liver, however this is higher than normal for the patient.
This may be a result of intravscular depletion from diuretics.
