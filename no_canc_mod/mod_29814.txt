Admission Date:  [**2200-4-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2200-4-6**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old man with past medical history of coronary artery disease, status post stent to the left circumflex artery as well as history of chronic left bundle branch block.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**4-1**] with complaint of [**3-16**] weeks of epigastric pain.
The patient describes the pain as [**7-20**] and nonradiating.
The patient states that the pain was not associated with shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, or palpitations.
The patient reports that on [**3-31**], he awoke from a nap with severe pain.
The patient also reports increasing dyspnea on exertion.
Several years ago the patient noted dyspnea on exertion with a two block walk.
ETT MIBI in [**2194**] disclosed no electrocardiogram changes or perfusion defects.
Over the past few months the patient has become short of breath over only a half a block walk.
He experiences dyspnea on exertion occasionally accompanied by a nonradiating epigastric pain, though the pain is only 1.5/10.
Patient was admitted to Medicine Service on [**3-31**] for evaluation of his epigastric pain.
He underwent MRI/MRA for workup for possible mesenteric ischemia.
It did disclose intra and extrahepatic ductal dilatation.
He eventually became pain free.
At catheterization the patient was found to have three vessel coronary artery disease, left anterior descending artery had 95% calcified stenosis before D1.
There is an 80% focal stenosis after D1.
The left circumflex had 40% stenosis of OM-2, 40% of the ramus was occluded.
Right coronary artery was heavily calcified with 50% stenosis in the mid vessel and 90% stenosis in the branching PL.
Furthermore, during the catheterization patient had episode of asystole requiring temporary pacing.
The patient had PTCA and stent to the left circumflex lesion with 20% residual stenosis.
There were no wall motion abnormalities.
There was mild mitral regurgitation.
Chronic left bundle branch block.
Transient ischemic attack.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Heart:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, distant heart sounds.
Abdomen is obese, nontender, positive bowel sounds.
IMAGING:  MRI/MRA of the abdomen disclosed celiac and SMA widely patent, severe intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct dilatation, no common bile duct stone, or ampullary mass identified.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Sinus bradycardia at 48 beats per minute, prolonged P-R interval, left bundle branch block, no significant ST segment elevation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is noted.
C. Rhythm:  The patient is noted to have bradycardia during catheterization.
EP service recommended starting a low dose beta blocker, and monitoring the heart rate for his signs and symptoms of chronotropic insufficiency.
Etiology of bradycardia/asystole event thought to be related to catheter used during cardiac catheterization.
Furthermore, the patient has no history of syncope/presyncope.
NonST elevation myocardial infarction.
Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Nitroglycerin sublingual prn chest pain.
