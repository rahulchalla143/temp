No crackles or wheezes.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, tender left lower quadrant and flank, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Of note, on the morning after admission the patient was awake and alert with lacrimation, rhinorrhea, increased yawning, nausea.
Low T wave amplitude is non-specific.
Otherwise, unstable baseline makes assessment difficult.
Otherwise, there may be no significant change.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is mild atherosclerotic calcification along the aortic arch and minimal along the coronary arteries.
A small nodule is seen within the right thyroid gland measuring approximately 7 mm in diameter.
The mediastinal great vessels appear normal in course and caliber without evidence of aneurysm or dissection.
There is an aortic origin of the left vertebral artery, a normal variant.
The pulmonary arterial tree opacifies normally and there is no evidence of a central filling defect through the level of the segmental branches.
There is no mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

There is bilateral lower lobe posterior consolidation most compatible with dependent atelectasis.
No worrisome pulmonary nodules or masses are seen.

No free air or free fluid is seen.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
The stomach and duodenum appear unremarkable.
PELVIS: Given the lack of enteric contrast, evaluation for bowel wall thickening is limited.
There is a suggestion of mild thickening involving several loops of jejunum in the left upper quadrant, though there is no associated obstruction or fat stranding.

CT HEAD WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST([**2112-4-13**]): Awaiting final read....   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old female with multiple medical problems including complex autoimmune disease (Sjogren / sarcoid overlap syndrome), diabetes, Takayasu arteritis, who presented to the ED with flank pain and nausea for 6 days, concerning for urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis.
She was admitted to the MICU after she was found to have altered mental status, hypoxia, hypercarbia and elevated carboxyhemoglobin.
# Respiratory Failure: On admission, the patient was found to have mixed hypercarbia and hypoxia.
# Somnolence and altered mental status: Patient was noted to be somnolent and unable to stay awake for even short conversations on admission.
All of the patient's outpatient sedating medications were held for altered mental status.
On hospital day 2, the patient appeared to have symptoms of narcotic withdrawal with increased rhinorrhea, yawning, irritability, piloerection, mydriasis, and nausea on the morning after admission.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4321**], during her MICU stay which revealed an evolving medication regimen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4321**] feels that she is very compliant with pain medications and is not concerned about abuse.
On the day the patient was transferred to Medicine floor, she was noted to have impared concentration and inattention but other neurological exam was essentially benign.
On the day of disposition, patient was alert and oriented, near her baseline mental status.
# Carboxyhemoglobinemia: Ongoing problem with elevated levels of carboxyhemoglobin noted in previous outpatient labs.
# Chronic pain: The patient's outpatient sedating medications were initially held due to the patient's mental status and were restarted as her mental status improved.
Despite being off all narcotics as well as her adjuvant pain medications, pt did not have pain and was happy to be off all her medications.
# Nausea, flank pain: Most consistent with urinary tract infection versus pyelonephritis however CTA ab/pelvis negative for ischemia or other acute abnormality and urine cultures negative.
PCP wonders about interstitial nephritis but has difficulty with following up with male urologist.
It was continued at 0.1 to reduce symptoms of withdrawl during her hospitalization, and thought that should tolerate as outpt.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Two (2) tsp PO four times a day as needed for thrush.
