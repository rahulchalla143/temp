Her history dates back to [**5-/2180**] when she was found down in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] and diagnosed with a large myocardial infarction.
She was intubated for four days, subsequently extubated and reintubated several hours later due to respiratory distress.
Her surgery was uneventful and she was extubated without difficulty but subsequently developed progressive dyspnea and wheezing and was admitted on [**2180-7-14**] and found to have moderate-to-severe post-intubation tracheal stenosis commencing approximately 3 cm below the vocal cords.
While waiting transfer to a tertiary care medical center, she developed an episode of bradycardia and required intubation, however, the endotracheal tube was unable be advanced beyond the stenosis.
Past Medical History: Significant for coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**5-/2180**], status post coronary artery bypass grafting x3 in [**Location (un) 6185**], hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes.

2) Absence of the septum pellucidum, likely congenital in origin.
Focal segment of tracheal stenosis involving the subglottic and upper intrathoracic trachea.
Nonspecific mild ground-glass opacity in the medial aspect of the superior segment of the right lower lobe, which could be secondary to aspiration.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged   Brief Hospital Course: Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-23**] from an OSH for management of her tracheal stenosis likely secondary to intubation.
On admission she was started on levofloxacin and flagyl for empiric coverage against a possible pneumonia, for which she was being treated with zosyn and ceftriaxone at her OSH.
For her tracheal stenosis she was started on solumedrol and given nebs.
Bronchoscopy on [**7-24**] showed severe tracheal stenosis 5mm in diamter and 2.5cm in length.
On [**7-25**] Ms [**Known lastname **] was found to be HIT positive and was therefore started on an argatroban drip.
At that time she was seen by cardiology for pre-operative clearance.
Although she had had recent CABG, the cardiologists felt that she had no current high risk prognostic features and therefore cleared her for surgery.
also began having runs of SVT at this time requiring IV lopressor 15-20mg.
On [**7-27**] she was underwent rigid bronch and tracheal dilation without incident.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
She was planned for surgery on [**7-31**] for a tracheal resection, although her runs of SVT continued.
Bronchial washings at this time were negative for malignancy.
Pt contiued to have SVT with non-specific ST changes on [**7-31**], and therefore the surgery was postponed.
On [**8-1**] she went to the OR for rigid bronch and balloon dilation of trachea to 14mm without complications.
On [**8-2**] pt was extubated without difficulty and was seen by speech and swallow who felt she was aspirating with thin liquids and recommended nectar thick liquids and ground solids.
She continued to have episodes of narrow complex SVT.
On POD 2 pt became supratherapeutic on her coumadin.
In addition, her metoprolol was decreased to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] from 25 [**Hospital1 **] for hypotension into the low 90's/50s.
On the morning of POD3 pt was noted to be hypoglycemic and was given 1amp of D50.
However she continued to be lethargic and began having a short run of narrow complex SVT.
Pt was sent for a head CT which was negative for an intracranial bleed and was seen by neurology.
The right-sided weakness resolved later that day.
On POD4 pt had another run of SVT and her metoprolol was changed to toprol xl 50mg qday per cardiology.
