A small amount of fluid and free air are expected post- operative findings.
Bibasilar and small right apical atelectatic changes.
No evidence of aortic dissection or aneurysm.
[**2101-8-28**] C-spine plain film: No fractures.
Mild cervical spine anterolisthesis.
Degenerative changes.
[**2101-9-6**] RLE ultrasound: Approximately 6 x 1.6 cm hypoechoic structure deep to a wound in the right lower extremity these features are non-specific and may be due to an abscess a hematoma or local area of inflammation.
Mild Ascites.
Mild mitral regurgitation  NEUROLOGY:  [**2101-9-14**] EEG: This is a mildly abnormal EEG obtained in wakefulness and drowsiness due to the presence of generalized delta frequency slowing that was more pronounced during periods of drowsiness.
There were no lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities seen.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 54 year old man who presented from an outside hospital with a grade 3 splenic laceration status-post a motorcycle crash.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he was found to be hypotensive with a hematocrit of 12 and was immediately transfused with 6 units of PRBC.
His post-operative course was notable for hypotension which initially required pressor support (an echocardiogram was done which was normal) and ventilary dependence.
He was treated empirically with Zosyn for 2 weeks for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
He had a right groin hematoma (secondary to traumatic femoral line placement) which was drained at the bedside on post-operative day 10.
A neurology consultation was requested for altered mental status and aggitation on post-operative day 18; workup with  EEG revealed non-specific deep midline subcortical dysfunction.
Upon discharge he had scheduled follow-up with trauma surgery to have his trach removed.
