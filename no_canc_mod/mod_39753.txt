He woke up this morning at 5:30am with central substernal chest pain which he described as pain/pressure.
The pain did not radiate to either arm or jaw and was not accompanied by shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.
He presented to [**Hospital3 **] at 3:45pm where he was diagnosed with an inferior MI and given ASA 325, 600mg plavix, started on a heparin drip.
Coronary angiography showed 100% occlusion in the RCA, 40% occlusion in the left main, and a clean circumflex.
He was without any chest pain, shortness of breath or nausea.
He reports one similar episode of chest pain approximately one year ago at which time he was diagnosed with a pneumonia.
Otherwise no prior episodes of chest pain and no anginal symptoms.
He noticed that his blood sugars were high over the last few days but otherwise no recent change in his health.
He has recently been feeling well without any particular recent illnesses or stresses.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes x 7 years Hypertension Hyperlipidemia History of Pneumonia   Social History: - Tobacco history: never smoker - ETOH: rare - Illicit drugs: none Originally from [**Country 2045**].
Family History: -Father died of MI at 71 -Mother living with hypertension -Multiple family members with diabetes -Sister with breast cancer Otherwise non-contributory.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease with associated left main disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate to severe systemic arterial hypertension (184/89mmHg).
Rhythm during the case was a junctional rhythm with isorhythmic dissociation from a slightly slower atrial escape rhythm.
There were episodes of ventricular bigemeny.
Prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Dilated ascending aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 58 year old male with history of type II DM and HTN presenting with an inferior MI now s/p 1x DES to RCA.
# CAD/Inferior MI: Patient presented with chest pain EKG pattern (ST elevations in III > II and ST elevations in V4R) suggestive of right ventricular infarct.
Cardiac cath showed 100% RCA occlusion 40% left main, clean circ.
Given multi vessel disease patient will need stress test in 1 week to assess 40% left main disease for possible cardiac surgery.
# ?Infiltrative cardiomyopathy: Patient's [**2137-9-9**] TEE showed echogenic texture with ground glass appearance, concerning for possible infiltrative cardiomyopathy.
# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine 1.3 on admission.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: # DM: Pt has 7 year history of type II diabetes on metformin at home.
Lisinopril was decreased from 60mg to 40 mg in the setting of acute kidney injury.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Pt started on high dose atorvastatin 80mg PO daily  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization - HbA1c 12% on admission, pt will likely need to start insulin regimen at home - Medication changes:    - Atenolol and amlodipine were stopped    - Lisinopril decreased from 60mg daily to 40mg daily    - HCTZ held during hospitalization, pt asked to resume after discharge    - Simvastatin changed to atorvastatin 80mg daily    - Started carvedilol 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **], ASA 325mg daily, Prasugrel 10mg daily - F/u SPEP and UPEP (results pending at discharge) - F/u stress echo on [**2137-9-17**] to assess left main vessel disease - F/u cardiac MRI on [**2137-10-10**] for question of infiltrative myopathy  Medications on Admission: Atenolol 50mg daily Lisinopril 60mg daily Metformin 500mg daily (no longer on glyburide) Amlodipine 10mg daily Simvastatin 40mg daily K-Dur 20mEq twice daily Hydrochlorothiazide 50mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 325 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis:  ST elevation myocardial infarction  Secondary Diagnosis:  Type II Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
