Name: [**Known lastname 7379**],[**Known firstname 7380**] L            Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 7381**]  Admission Date:  [**2104-12-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2105-1-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2050-12-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 7382**] is a 56 year old woman with coronary artery disease, Type 1 diabetes mellitus who was in her usual state of health until roughly one to two weeks prior to admission when she started to experience chest pressure, relieved with sublingual Nitroglycerin.
The patient has been experiencing more frequent episodes of chest pressure up to several times per week at rest.
The day prior to admission the patient again experienced her usual angina which she describes as "pressure" in the middle of her chest at rest.
She took one sublingual Nitroglycerin which relieved the pain, however, the pressure then returned 30 minutes later and was again relieved with one sublingual Nitroglycerin and then returned soon after as a sharp mid sternal chest pain not relieved by Nitroglycerin.
She was also experiencing shortness of breath by then, nausea, vomiting and diaphoresis.
In the [**Hospital1 328**] Emergency Department she was found to have ST elevations in 3, [**Street Address(2) **] depressions in AVL, .
[**Street Address(2) 7383**] depressions in V3, V4, Q waves in V1 and V2 and slightly prolonged QT interval.
Myocardial infarction times two in [**2097**] and then again in [**2102**].
Renal insufficiency.
Diabetes Type 1 for 47 years, complicated by retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy.
Chronic anemia.
Vitamin C.  ALLERGIES:  Bactrim which causes nausea and Biaxin which causes nausea.
In general, the patient was lying in bed, nonrebreather but speaking in full sentences in no apparent distress, resting tremor right foot and left hand.
Left eye with decreased vision and surgical pupil.
No jugulovenous distension appreciated at 45 degrees.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs, inspiratory crackles bilaterally to one-third on the right and one-half the way up the lungs on the left, no wheezes or rhonchi.
Resting tremor right foot, left hand, decreased sensation, bilaterally in the feet to 2 cm above the ankle.
Chest x-ray, bilateral basilar opacities.
Last catheterization in [**2103-6-8**] showed diffuse disease with a 90% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery and diffuse disease in all other vessels with three vessel disease.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 56 year old female with extensive three vessel disease presenting with chest pain and an elevation of cardiac enzymes.
Electrocardiogram changes were consistent with occlusion at the mid distal right coronary artery, patient also presented with poorly controlled blood sugars.
for afterload reduction.
There was an 80% stenosis of the diagonal branch, 60% stenosis of the proximal circumflex and 90% stenosis of the obtuse marginal 1.
Comments on cardiac catheterization revealed severe three vessel disease.
Hemodynamics revealed a markedly elevated left-sided filling pressure with an left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 31 mm of mercury.
The left ventriculography was deferred secondary to the patient's renal insufficiency and elevated left-sided filling pressures.
Her peak creatinine kinase was 1,112 with third creatinine kinase coming down to 692.
As the right coronary artery lesion was complex and not stented due to the high risk of restenosis it was decided to perform a nuclear ETT to further quantitate the level of ischemia from this lesion and determine if the patient needed emergent/aggressive measures now versus waiting for the future drug-eluding stent.
On [**2106-1-6**] the patient had the cardiac stress test.
A Persantine MIBI was done which showed reversible perfusion defects in the apical inferior and septal walls of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 23% based on gated imaging.
The distal stent was then post-dilated with a 3.0 mm balloon.
She had Mucomyst pre and post catheterization.
For the patient's known congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of roughly 30%, she was given gentle intravenous Lasix for diuresis.
There was lipomatous hypertrophy of the intra-atrial septum.
The patient had the following resting regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, akinetic basal inferior wall, hypokinetic mid inferior wall, hypokinetic basal inferolateral wall and hypokinetic mid inferior lateral wall.
Right ventricular size was normal, 1+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, no pericardial effusion.
Endocrine - The patient has longstanding Type 1 diabetes with multiple complications.
AM with the 20 of NPH and the regular insulin sliding scale.
Infectious disease - The patient was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection on admission.
She was initially treated with Ciprofloxacin for this urinary tract infection.
The urine culture grew out Klebsiella which was sensitive to Levofloxacin and therefore the patient was continued on Ciprofloxacin for a five day course.
ST elevation inferior myocardial infarction 2.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy 3.
Chronic renal insufficiency 4.
Anemia of chronic disease 5.
Klebsiella urinary tract infection 6.
Gastroparesis  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  She was to have [**Hospital6 2050**] for medication review and diabetes management.
