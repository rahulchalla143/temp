HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who initially presented to the  [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**2150-4-25**], after suffering a left hip fracture (displaced subcapital fracture).
This occurred as a result of a mechanical fall, apparently related to left leg weakness the patient attributed to her diabetic neuropathy.
Urine grew Klebsiella and E. coli although the patient reported "chronic UTIs" and it is unclear whether she had thrombocytopenia (platelets 60's) so the Hematology Service was consulted.
Unfortunately, although medically cleared for surgery, the patient by that time had developed a significant coccygeal decubitus ulcer.
Chest x-ray on [**4-30**] showed a left infiltrate with effusion, and borderline congestive heart failure.
Follow-up x-rays showed worsening of the infiltrate and effusion and aspiration pneumonia was suspected, so Flagyl was begun on [**5-7**].
The patient is very eager to have the hip repaired and complains mostly of hip pain and related leg muscle spasm.
She denies dyspnea or chest pain.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft times three in [**2135**].
Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction 20%.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (not currently on any inhalers).
Mitral regurgitation confirmed by echocardiogram.
Atrial fibrillation, currently in sinus rhythm status post cardioversion not on Coumadin at the time of admission.
Left subcapital displaced hip fracture [**2150-4-19**].
Chronic renal insufficiency likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
Coccygeal decubitus ulcer.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Colon cancer status post partial colectomy.
Right carotid bruit (no history of transient ischemic attack or stroke).
Peripheral parenteral nutrition.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for lung cancer relative unknown at time of dictation at present.
Anicteric sclerae.
Extremities:  Two plus pitting edema to buttocks bilaterally.
No cyanosis or clubbing.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  [**4-29**]:  Normal sinus rhythm of 64 beats per minute, right axis deviation, intraventricular conduction delay, poor R-wave progression, T-wave inversion in leads V5 through V6 and 1 and aVL.
No ST segment deviation.
Was complaining of feeling tired and not able to sleep with some pain in her back over the location of the decubitus ulcer.
A chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 69**] showed cardiomegaly with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema.
Moderate left effusion, small right effusion.
No pneumothorax.
At that time it was Dr.[**Name (NI) 2989**] opinion that the patient would not be a candidate for surgery until her decubitus ulcer infection was controlled.
At that time it was recommended that the patient be started on Remeron at 7.5 mg to help with her anxiety and depressed mood.
Given this finding along with the chest x-ray findings, it was recommended that the CHF Service would consult.
[**2150-5-15**]:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] spoke with the patient's outpatient cardiologist who reported the patient is not usually in congestive heart failure and this was probably an acute exacerbation secondary to increased fluids due to the patient's poor p.o.
The patient had had left bundle branch block according to her outpatient cardiologist and also had a history of atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion and on the [**5-15**] the patient was found to be in right bundle branch block.
Due to the acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure it was felt that the patient was at high risk for re-entering rapid atrial fibrillation and a Cardiology consult was obtained.
The patient had minimal diuresis of 250 cc overnight with Lasix.
The patient was continued on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.
The coccygeal ulcer continued to be dressed appropriately.
The patient developed a new issue of hyperglycemia.
The patient's diuresis was slightly improved at 400 cc in two hours on nesiritide and Lasix 80 mg IV times one.
Repeat chest x-ray showed persistent congestive heart failure with effusions as described above.
Psychiatry continued to follow and felt that Remeron might be contributing to her sedation and that her depression might be secondary to her multiple medical conditions.
The patient, however, was extremely reluctant to undergo additional interventions such as Swan-Ganz catheter placement and was actually scheduled for the Operating Room on [**2150-5-18**], despite her poor oxygenation at 99% on five liters nasal cannula and poor diuresis (CHF).
Chest x-ray findings suggested a potential aspiration pneumonia.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained that showed an ejection fraction of less than 20%, moderate dilation of the right atrium.
Left ventricle:  Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Left wall motion:  The following resting regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities were seen:  Basal inferior - akinetic; mid inferior - akinetic; basal inferolateral - akinetic; mid inferolateral - akinetic; inferior apex - akinetic; lateral apex - akinetic.
Moderate global.
Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
Aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mitral valve: Valve leaflets mildly thickened, 3+ mitral regurgitation.
The decubitus ulcer continued to be dressed per standard protocol.
[**2150-5-20**]:  The patient's levofloxacin and Flagyl was discontinued after cultures showed no growth and the chest x-ray was most consistent with congestive heart failure.
for afterload reduction.
[**2150-5-21**]:  A Podiatry consult was obtained to evaluate the patient's risk of infection secondary to open bullae on her distal extremities with decreased sensation in the setting of diabetes preoperatively.
Possibly as a result of the decreased platelets and/or uremic platelets, it was difficult to attain adequate hemostasis post procedure, therefore, lidocaine with epinephrine was injected at the site.
The patient was made NPO after midnight in anticipation of the repair of her left minimally displaced subcapital femur fracture on [**2150-5-24**].
Surgeon [**Doctor Last Name 12528**] under general anesthesia with an estimated blood loss of 250 cc.
The patient completed the surgery without complications and was hemodynamically stable and transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit.
