HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction seven years ago, status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft seven years ago with saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one who has been asymptomatic since who was in his usual state of health this evening when he developed lightheadedness followed by syncope and loss of bowel control while sitting in a chair watching TV.
The patient denies any history of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations prior to this syncope.
Currently he is again without any chest pain or lightheadedness.
He also notes decreased urine stream and decreased urine output over the last few days.
He also notes decreased appetite and decreased po intake over the past few days.
He denies any orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower extremity edema.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction/three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2173**].
Chronic renal insufficiency per wife.
No active tobacco.
No scleral icterus.
Dry mucous membranes.
Lungs, there is scattered crackles at the bases right greater then left.
No murmur noted.
Extremities, there is trace lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Skin examination the patient has warm, dry skin with a slightly raised pink macular papular rash over his abdomen and some linear petechia on his lower extremities bilaterally.
Genitourinary, the patient with mild swelling of the foreskin at the ureteral meatus.
No evidence of balanitis.
No erythema or discharge.
Chest x-ray revealed pulmonary edema.
Ischemia:  The patient with a history of coronary artery disease status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2173**] given new onset of complete heart block, although the patient had no electrocardiogram changes consistent with ischemia.
He will need an outpatient stress test at some point to determine if there is any new inducible ischemia after his previous coronary artery bypass graft.
Pump:  The patient is hypotensive on arrival.
Repeat echocardiogram revealed an EF of 20%, multiple regional wall motion abnormalities.
No significant change since echocardiogram in [**Month (only) 958**] at outside hospital.
The patient continues Cozaar for afterload reduction.
EP:  The patient was admitted with complete heart block secondary to hyperkalemia.
The patient did have one rune of twelve beats of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in the setting of a low magnesium.
The patient's magnesium was repleted and the patient had no further ectopy.
Renal:  The patient with acute renal failure.
The patient also had a renal ultrasound, which was negative for obstruction, however, revealed a question of an echogenic mass in the left upper pole.
FEN:  Patient was admitted with a potassium of 8.0 likely secondary to recently starting Aldactone, using Indocin for gout and worsening renal function.
The patient's Foley was discontinued with good urine output and continued decrease in his creatinine.
Acute renal failure.
Complete heart block.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction and three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2173**].
DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician regarding further neuropsychiatric testing and MRI of his head and workup of left upper pole renal mass with MRI versus CT of the abdomen and kidneys.
The patient needs his potassium and creatinine checked in one week or the patient needs an electrocardiogram in one week for evidence of heart block/bradycardia.
The patient is also to follow up with his cardiologist for management of his cardiac medications, future exercise stress testing and a possible electrophysiology study and internal cardiac defibrillator.
