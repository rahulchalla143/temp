The patient is a 54 year-old white male with known coronary artery disease, angioplasty and stent placement in [**Month (only) 216**] of this year with diabetes, hypertension and history of SIADH.
He has known peripheral vascular disease and underwent a right femoral AT bypass with flap in [**Month (only) **] of this year who returns now with increasing left calf claudication and rest pain times one week.
The patient is scheduled for an outpatient arteriogram on [**2147-1-3**], but because of increasing symptoms the patient is now admitted for further evaluation and treatment.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He was recatheterized on [**2146-9-20**] for elevated cardiac enzymes.
He has been a diabetic since the age of 32 with triopathy.
Hypertension, history of hip fractures secondary to motor vehicle accident in [**2140**], osteomyelitis of the right fifth metatarsal head in [**Month (only) **] of this year.
Peripheral vascular disease.
General appearence, alert, cooperative male in no acute distress.
There are no carotid or femoral bruits.
Bone joint examination shows no ankle edema.
The right foot is warm, pink with a yield fifth metatarsal head incision.
There is severe dependent ruber.
There is a dry gangrenous lesion on the medial aspect of the first metatarsal head.
He underwent arteriogram on [**2147-1-3**], which demonstrated normal aorta, iliac without significant disease on the left, mild diffuse disease of the superficial femoral artery and PFA.
The superficial femoral artery occludes at the adductor canal, reconstitutes as AK popliteal with moderate disease, BK popliteal has moderate disease with significant proximal AT disease.
There is no proximal PT or peroneal.
Pulmonary consult was placed prior to surgery to assess pulmonary risks with chest x-ray findings of left lower lobe pneumonia.
They felt that he had appropriate coverage with Levofloxacin and Flagyl and there was a low suspicion for pulmonary embolus and there was an effusion that should be tapped and cultured otherwise was to proceed with planned surgery.
He underwent an intraoperative TE, which showed global right ventricular and left ventricular hypokinesis, moderate MR to severe MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 13223**].
Cardiology was consulted regarding elevated enzymes and diminished cardiac index.
He was slow with ambulation limited for weight bear.
The patient required 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation secondary to his myocardial events.
He should follow up with his endocrinologist for continued management of his adrenal insufficiency and his cardiologist regarding his cardiac follow up.
Left atrium was elongated, the right atrium and intraatrial septum was moderately dilated.
The resting regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities are seen in the basilar anterior, which is hypokinetic, mid anterior, which is hypokinetic.
Basal inferior septal, which is hypokinetic.
Mid inferior septal, which is hypokinetic.
Right ventricle shows severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
Ischemic left foot status post left common femoral to posterior tibial bypass in situ saphenous vein.
Perioperative myocardial infarction treated, ejection fraction 20 to 25%.
Adrenal insufficiency treated on maintenance minimal corticosteroids.
Diabetes insulin dependent, stable.
