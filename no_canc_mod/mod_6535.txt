Admission Date:  [**2171-9-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-10-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-5-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Allopurinol / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4980**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old female with a h/o symptomatic bradycardia s/p recent pacemaker placement, COPD, A.fib on ASA, vascular dementia who presented from rehab with a complaint of worsening cough throughout the day, shortness of breath, chest pain and increasing confusion per her home health aid.
CXR was done with no evidence of infiltrate, EKG with A.fib in the 100's, however given her symptoms she was empirically treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Later during her course in the ER she became hypotensive with a temperature of 100, had a CTA that ruled out a PE, at CT head that did not show an acute process, an abdominal ultrasound was done that did not show any intra-abdominal pathology, but did show a pericardial effusion.
As a result cardiology did a bedside echo, which showed a small pericardial effusion, no evidence of tamponade.
She is currently denying any pain, denies any CP, SOB, n/v/d, dysuria, back pain or palpitations.

[**2171-9-26**] MRSA screen- no MRSA isolated.
[**2171-9-29**] Blood culture- No growth.
[**2171-9-30**] Blood culture- No growth.
[**2171-9-30**] Urine culture- No growth.
........ Studies: [**2171-9-25**] CXR: Low lung volumes, but no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Extensive encephalomalacia in the right frontal and left parietal lobes,compatible with old infarcts.
Given the lack of priors and presence of pacemaker, consider followup CT without and with contrast to exclude mass lesions .
No acute pulmonary embolism or aortic pathology.
Small right-sided pleural effusion.
Severe anterior wedge T6 compression fracture, chronic in appearance.
Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
[**2171-9-26**] TTE: Small LV cavity size with mild symmetric LVH and hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Mild resting LVOT gradient.
Probable diastolic dysfunction.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Calcified mitral and aortic valve.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
[**2171-9-29**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and ventricular paced beat.
Left axis deviation may be due to left anterior fascicular block and/or possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2171-9-26**] atrial fibrillation has replaced sinus tachycardia.
[**2171-10-2**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation and paced beats at 71 beats per minute.
[**2171-10-2**] CXR: There is opacification at both bases consistent with moderate pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis.
Fullness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure in patient with some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old female with h/o A.fib on ASA, tachybrady syndrome s/p PPM placement, COPD, hypothyroid who presented with hypotension, cough, chest pain and worsening mental status.
She was initially started on levophed but weaned off without difficulty shortly after admission.
Her stool was guaiaic negative and transfusion was deferred as the patient was asymptomatic from her anemia.
She did not appear septic as there was no identifiable infectious source- blood and urine cultures from [**9-25**] were negative.
While in the MICU, the patient went into afib with tachycardia and developed transient hypotension - possibly this was a contributing factor to her initial presentation.
There was no evidence of heart failure on her initial CXR and no discrete cause for her hypotension on ECHO.
Patient's hypotension was responsive to fluid boluses and she was transferred to the floor where she did not require any further pressure support or fluid boluses, maintaining pressures in the 130s-140s.
# Shortness of Breath: Upon admission, patient was maintained on O2 and nebulizers, and it as thought her symptoms were most likely [**3-19**] volume overload.
However, she remained SOB at times.
She spiked a fever two days prior to transfer to the wards, and her CXR, although not grossly different, still showed some RLL process concerning for [**Month/Day (2) 10540**].
At the same time, we thought a COPD exacerbation was contributing, so she was started on steroids, the [**Month/Day (2) 10540**] abx, and continued on nebulizers (xopenex, given her AF, and atrovent).
On the day of transfer to the wards, we were less convinced of the [**Name (NI) 10540**] (pt was afebrile, without a WBC elevation, and numerous cultures negative to date), so vanc and cefepime were changed to abx for COPD exacerbation (azithromycin, as patient is allergic to levofloxacin).
Diuresis for presumed diastolic heart failure was restarted with IV lasix as patient sounded crackly on exam and a repeat CXR showed engorged pulmonary vasculature.
Given her hypotension she was started on digoxin with the goal of tapering down her metoprolol dose.
For the rest of her hospitalization, the patient was monitored on telemetry and remained largely in AF with ventricular pacing at a rate in the 60s-70s.
Iron studies were sent and seemed consistent with an anemia of chronic disease picture.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH was checked on [**9-26**] and was 0.94.
# Diabetes: Patient's glipizide was held while she was an inpatient, but she was continued on her home metformin and put on an insulin sliding scale with QID finger stick blood sugar checks.
# Code: DNR/DNI .
Guaifenesin 600 mg Tablet Sustained Release Sig: Two (2) Tablet Sustained Release PO once a day as needed for cough .
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety, agitation .
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Hospice of the Good [**Doctor Last Name 9995**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Tachy-Brady Syndrome status post pacemaker placement Atrial fibrillation Diastolic heart failure Hypertension Anxiety/depression Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma Dementia (multi-vascular) Diabetes mellitus type 2 Hyperlipidemia Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you had trouble breathing.
You were transferred to the medical wards where you were continued on treatments for your chronic lung disease and your heart disease.
We have made the following changes to your medications: - Please start taking digoxin every other day as indicated - Please change your metoprolol from metoprolol succinate to metoprolol tartrate and take it as indicated on Saturday and Sunday and then stop taking any kind of metoprolol until you follow up with your doctor - Please take xopenex and ipratropium nebulization treatments as needed for your shortness of breath  You may continue taking your other medications as you were previously.
