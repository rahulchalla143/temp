Numerous gas bubbles within the  brain predominantly extra axial suggesting a communication between the brain and sphenoid sinus.
No acute edema.
Impression: This is a 68 year old man visiting MA from [**Country 11150**], history of chordoma of the clivus s/p resection x 2 and XRT with  diplopia at baseline who presents with meningitis both clinically and by LP results, preceeded by clear leakage from the nose (CSF?)
Possible infectious etiologies include streptococcus and staph, listeria, any lung/sinus pathogens, more unusual pathogens like TB given he is from [**Country 11150**].
- check CXR for infiltrates, TB nodules - swab throat for strep, culture - tylenol for fever, pain - airborne precautions - q 2 hr neuro checks, watch for complications of meningitis including stroke,venous thrombosis, abscess/empyema, change in neurologic exam, seizures, further decline in mental status.
Hyponatremia - check Na tonight to ensure not falling - likely secondary to dehydration given fever, illness, decreased PO intake, although could be secondary to SIADH.
Asthma - prn albuterol  5.
Hyperglycemia - RISS and FS QID.
PPx: protonix, SC heparin, pneumoboots, inspiration spirometer FEN: house diet, IVF FULL CODE Dispo: pending workup   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Image-guided endoscopic sinus surgery with endoscopic repair of left cribriform plate cerebrospinal fluid leak with left superior turbinate graft and repair of sella turcica cerebrospinal fluid CSF leak with left middle turbinate.
History of Present Illness: This is a 68 year old Hindi (with some English) speaking man with history of clivus chordoma tumor resection x 2 who presents from [**Hospital **] hospital with headache, fever, neck pain.
Yesterday, he vomited 3 times "undigested food" and complained of belly discomfort.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical backup.
He has baseline double vision from chordoma (see PMHx), no difficulty swallowing or chewing, although his PO intake has been poor for over 24 hrs.
He denies cough, recent pneumonia, sinus pain or infections, chest pain, belly pain, skin changes/rash.
No recent dental work, no tooth pain.
No TB infection to his knowledge although likely has been exposed in Inida.
First presented with diplopia (horizontal) that resolved after first resection.
He again developed diplopia and was found  to have recurrence of his chordoma, was resected [**2157**], but the diplopia persisted.
Most recent MRI [**2-16**] (per report wife gives us, copy is in chart) shows no signif change, no new lesion.
No etoh, no drugs.

INDICATION: History of clival tumor infection pneumocephalus and meningitis.
FINDINGS:  As noted on the CT of the brain, there is a marked amount of intracranial air, which is distributed in the subarachnoid space.
There has been destruction or resection of a portion of the posterior nasal septum.
The sphenoid sinus has irregular bony density and erosion, and there is a defect in the inferior sinus, which is likely surgical.
Clival bony density is irregular and overall evidence of lytic process in the clivus is identified.
The exact location of the intracranial air leak is uncertain.
IMPRESSION: There are postoperative changes and evidence of a destructive mass of the clivus and sphenoid, as well as the floor of the sella.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2160-8-10**] 2:23 PM  MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  Reason: Please eval chordoma recurrence, meningitis status Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 68 year old man with h/o chordoma w/ recent CSF leak and meningitis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please eval chordoma recurrence, meningitis status INDICATION: Chordoma resection, recent CSF leak and meningitis.
There are multiple foci of air and susceptibility artifact within sulci throughout the brain, but mostly concentrated in the nondependent portions.
Post-contrast images do not show regions of enhancement of the leptomeninges.
There is diffuse slight increased sulcal enhancement, however, this may be artifactual.
The clivus shows abnormal signal on all sequences, and there is deformation of the adjacent brainstem, consistent with the patient's history of prior clivus surgery.
As identified on the previous examination, there is layering material within the lateral ventricles, which has increased somewhat in the interim.
There is no hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, intracranial mass lesion, or evidence of vascular territorial infarct.
Increased amount of layering material within both lateral ventricles concerning for intraventricular pus or hemorrhage.
Deformity of the clivus and adjacent brain stem, consistent with history of clivus surgery.
No definite evidence of chordoma recurrence.
Sinus disease as described above.
INDICATION: 68-year-old male with clival chordoma, status post surgery, evaluate for CSF fistula.
FINDINGS: The patient is status post clival surgery, with bone destruction at clivus, and the posterior wall of the sphenoid sinuses, as described previously.
Note is made of opacification of the residual sphenoid sinuses, with air-fluid level, as noted previously.
Bilateral internal auditory canals are patent.
IMPRESSION: Status post clival surgery, with bony destruction of clivus and posterior wall of the sphenoid, as described previously, with air-fluid level within the residual sphenoid sinus.
Small amount of intracranial air, which is decreased at the level of skull base; however, the superior portion of the head is not included in the present study.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 y/o male was admitted w/ symtoms of fever, neck stiffness/pain, decreased ambulation and mental status, n/v and decreased appetite.
ENT, Neurosurg consulted because of patient history of chordoma s/p resection x2 and recent history of clear nasal drainage.
Serial imaging demostrated that the destructive process affecting the skull base was stable and that it is difficult to distinguish recurrent from residual chordoma versus postoperative changes.
Mental status gradually improved and was normal by HD #3; His constitutional symptoms of fatigue and weakness were greatly improved throughout his stay.
During the pt's pre-operative stay, he developed a pneumonia that was cleared with a 7-day course of Flagyl.
Image-guided endoscopic sinus surgery with endoscopic repair of left cribriform plate cerebrospinal fluid leak with left superior turbinate graft and repair of sella turcica cerebrospinal fluid CSF leak with left middle turbinate.
Patient did have some issues with elevated heart rates.
Medicine and cardiology were both later consulted for management of sinus tachycardia.
