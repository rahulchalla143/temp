On the ambulance ride to that facility she experienced a transient episode of slurred speech with word finding difficulty.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after a CT scan revealed diffuse SAH.

Multiplanar maximum intensity projection as well as arterial reconstructed images were also reviewed.
Again noted is a moderate amount of subarachnoid blood, most notably layering in the suprasellar cistern and interpeduncular fossa.
There is also a small amount of intraventricular blood seen at the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally.
There is no new hemorrhage.
There is no edema, mass effect, or vascular territorial infarction.
Extracranial soft tissue structures as well as the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normal.
Post-contrast images show no abnormal enhancement.
A small infundibulum is also noted at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery.
There is no aneurysm.
IMPRESSION: Persistent subarachnoid hemorrhage, unchanged, with no aneurysm on CTA.
Provisional Findings Impression: GMdb FRI [**2104-2-29**] 1:25 PM Slight interval decrease in ventricular size.
Probably stable subarachnoid intraventricular hemorrhage, limited study due to presence of intravenous contrast from prior cerebral angiogram.
Therefore, there is contrast present in the venous sinuses which limits evaluation.
Within the limitations of the study, the amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage appears to be relatively stable.
The amount of intraventricular hemorrhage is unchanged.
No acute infarction is noted.
Within these limitations, the amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage appears relatively stable.

Resolution of intraventricular hemmorhage.
No large aneurysm.
Final Report CTA HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST  HISTORY: Aneurysm versus infundibulum at the right posterior communicating artery origin.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of new hemorrhage.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is again seen diffusely in the cisterns, but less prominent than on the prior head CT examination.
There is no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation.
There is no evidence of vasospasm.
A preliminary report was issued that read "subarachnoid hemorrhage and basilar cisterns.
Slightly decreased.
Resolution of intraventricular hemorrhage.
No large aneurysm.
CONCLUSION: No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Residual subarachnoid hemorrhage remains visible.
No evidence of aneurysm or stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: On the [**2-28**] this patient presented to our ED from an outside facility after a CT from the outside hospital revealed diffuse intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A CTA performed at the time of admition did not reveal an underlying aneurysm.
A CT of the head was performed after the angiogram to rule out hydorcephalus.
Her headaches were managed primarily with fiorocet.
It was negative for vasospasm and or aneurysm.
