Admission Date:  [**2187-5-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2187-5-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-11-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right Heart Catherization Pericardiocentesis   History of Present Illness: 70 M w/ DM, HTN, high cholesterol here with 3-4 weeks CP, pleuritic chest pain (no radiation, diaphoresis), intermittently relieved by " anti-inflammatory/ pain killers" prescribed 3 weeks ago by PCP and Tylenol.
In afternoon, while eating, CP returned [**9-24**]-> OSH where CT showed significant pericardial effusion.
At OSH, given ASA, NTG x3 w/ transient BP drop to 50's.
Given Morphine 16 mg IV w/o CP relief beyond [**7-25**].
Here at [**Hospital1 18**], given dilaudid 4 mg IV w/ pain relief to [**2192-4-19**].
No pulsus paradoxicus at the time of admission.
Pain free without deep breaths.
Past Medical History: HTN DM Hypercholesterolemia Colonoscopy two years ago (polyps removed)  Social History: Immigrated from the Azores ~30 years ago.
Reg, no murmurs, no knock, JVP ~3cm above notch Lungs: rare bibasilar rales Abdomen: Soft, NT, ND, no rebound or guarding Ext: Groin - no ecchymosis.
Low voltage.
Mild J point and ST segment elevation particularly in the lateral leads.
PR segment and elevation in lead aVR which raise question of pericarditis.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
There is left atrial diastolic collapse.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures (mean RA 17 mmHg, mean PCW 22 mmHg).
Pulmonary artery pressure was minimally elevated (mean PA 21 mmHg).
Systemic arterial pressures were normal with a 10 mmHg respirophasic variation in systolic pressure (borderline pulsus paradoxus).
Mean pericardial pressure decreased to 11 mmHg with respirophasic variation and inspiratory pressures near zero.
Cardiac echo performed in the cath lab after drainage showed a very small residual pericardial effusion.
Although patient initially had no obvious pulsus paradoxus at the time of admission, approximately 6 hours later on hospital day one, patient had a pulsus of approximately 15mm, which was confirmed later that morning by echocardiogram (sustained RV diastolic collapse) and right heart catherization (equalization of pressures, respiratory variation, and pericardial pressures 17-20mmHg).
In the cath lab, patient had 400cc of serosanguinous fluid drained.
Prior to removal of drain, echocardiogram revealed no signs of tamponade, but a continued small residual echodense pericardial effusion.
Nonetheless, patient was in excellent clinical condition following drainage and was afebrile throughout course, suggesting that the effusion was less likely purulent.
Therefore, given prodromic symptoms, it was thought that effusion was most likely secondary to viral/idiopathic cause.
With the pericardial drain in place, patient continued to have significant pleuritic pain, which was treated to good effect with indomethacin 50mg TID.
However, following removal of drain, patient was virtually pain free.
Furthermore, given no further symptoms of pericardial constriction, it was felt that further workup for pericardial constriction was unnecessary at this time.
At the time of discharge, patient was able to ambulate independently without any dyspnea on exertion.
Furthermore, pulsus continued to remain at 6mmHg making recurrence of effusion unlikely.
Patient was discharged with instructions to return for echocardiogram within one week of discharge, to see PCP in followup for chemistries and CBC (while on indomethacin) within one week, and to return to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in cardiology within two weeks to review echocardiogram results.
Disp:*21 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Cardiac Tamponade Probable Viral Pericarditis Diabetes Mellitus Type II Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good - Ambulating, Pulsus paradoxus 6mm Hg and stable.
Discharge Instructions: Continue taking indomethacin for pain as needed.
If you continue to have chest pain after one week, call your doctor to discuss continuing the medication.
If you have lightheadedness or worsening chest pain, call your doctor or 911.
