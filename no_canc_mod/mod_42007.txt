Shortly thereafter he began to exhibit seizure-like activity that lasted for a minute and is presumed to be a generalized tonic-clonic seizure based on description.
She reports that the patient has not had seizure previously.
He had no infectious symptoms the day prior.
He reportedly had no localization of pain or spontaneous eye opening.
He did not arrest but was intubated given altered mental status.
He initially had several laboratory abnormalities including elevated CK, CK-MB, LFTs, amylase, and lipase.
He was given 100mg IV keppra (due to an allergy to dilantin, which was previously used for seizure prophylaxis after his pituitary tumor resection).
A head CT was performed and negative for intracranial processes.
He was empirically started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for possible community-acquired meningitis.

There is no abnormal enhancement noted within except for minimal rim enhancement.
No foci of abnormal enhancement are noted elsewhere to suggest a mass lesion.
There are a few small foci of slightly increased DWI signal in the right parietal lobe (series 1402, image 20, 22), which are too small to be accurately characterized and may represent tiny infarcts.
There is increased signal intensity, diffusely to a mild extent in the mastoid air cells on both sides.
There is moderate mucosal thickening with fluid in the ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses.
The portal mucosal thickening and retention cysts are noted in the maxillary sinuses on both sides.
On the post-contrast images, there is a slightly heterogeneously enhancing pituitary gland with enlargement noted.
There is possible mild extension of the tumor into the cavernous sinus on the right side.
Focal area of altered signal intensity in the left frontal lobe with very minimal peripheral enhancement and extensive foci of negative susceptibility within, likely relates to an area of prior blood products.
No abnormal vessels noted adjacent.
Two small foci of increased DWI signal in right parietal lobe- acute-subacute tiny infarcts- attention on f/u.
Pan-paranasal sinus disease involving the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses predominantly and mild in the mastoid air cells on both sides.
Post-surgical changes in the sella, along with an enlarged pituitary gland, with slight heterogeneous enhancement.
There is possible mild extension of the tumor into the cavernous sinus on the right side.
Again, it showed a very low voltage, relatively rapid background of about [**11-27**] Hz, with some anterior predominance.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed muscle and other artifact, but there were no clearly epileptiform features.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed no electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
It showed a low voltage faster pattern, uniform in all head regions, throughout recording.
There were no areas of focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
Right bundle-branch block.
Slight ST segment and T wave abnormalities of unknown significance.
No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
No ASD or PFO seen.
HEAD CT [**2150-7-18**] - No acute intracranial hemorrhage, large vascular territory infarct, shift of midline structures or mass effect is present.
High-density lining the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter likely represents cortical laminar necrosis.
Visible paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells show diffuse polypoidal mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses and within the ethmoidal air cells and frontal sinus .
CXR [**2150-7-19**] - Slightly rotated positioning.
There is more pronounced focal opacity in the right midzone, in the perihilar area.
There is minimal atelectasis at the left base peripherally, with increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
Suspect small amount of fluid at the right costophrenic angle, unchanged.
IMPRESSION:  1) More pronounced focal opacity in the right perihilar region -- ?
atelectasis or early pneumonic infiltrate.
He had atypical symptoms with the infusion with an uninterpretable ECG.
INTERPRETATION:  The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue attenuation.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium.
Brief Hospital Course: # Neurologic: The description from the patient's wife, who witnessed the event, and the elevated creatine kinase seem consistent with seizure activity.
A head CT and a head MRI were both done and showed no acute intracranial processes.
The flouro-guided lumbar puncture showed 1 WBC and slightly elevated protein.
A 24 hour electroencephalogram showed global slowing consistant with alpha coma.
He has been placed on levetiracetam 750mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis.
He has had no focal neurological defects except R temporal visual field cut in R eye, described as a chronic problem per patient.
In 2 months he should have a repeat MRI to determine whether or not his sellar mass remains stable.
# Respiratory: Initial respiratory difficulty presumably was a result of altered mental status during post-ictal phase.
He initially had a lactic acidosis and consistent ABG abnormalities, likely as a result of seizing.
He was easily extubated following resolution of the post-ictal phase.
He had no further respiratory distress during the admission.
# Cardiovascular: Initial lab abnormalities included elevated cardiac enzymes.
Also EKG showed RBBB and inferolateral ST depression of 1mm in limb leads and 2mm in lateral precordial leads.
Given the EKG changes and CKMB elevation on admission, it was decided that during his admission he should have a pharmacological stress test with nuclear imaging.
# Endocrine: He has panhypopituitarism as a result of his trans-sphenoidal pituitary resection.
He should follow up with an endocrinologist to discuss his regimen, including whether he needs stress-dose steroids for illness and other emergency situations.
# Renal: Renal failure on initial presentation presumably due to prolonged hypoperfusion due to seizure activity.
His creatinine was trended and decreased during his stay, thus suggesting prerenal failure as the etiology.
He had no difficulties eating, drinking, or taking medications by mouth throughout this admission.
He has an appropriate level of mobility and will just need follow up for his L shoulder pain, thought to be a rotator cuff injury.
It is recommended that he have outpatient Orthopedics follow-up as well as outpatient PT for his L shoulder injury.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after having a first generalized seizure.
Most likely, this was caused by post-surgical changes in your brain from your pituitary surgery.
You were monitored with continuous EEG, and there were no concerning findings on this.
Because you initially had some EKG changes, we also performed a nuclear stress study of your heart, which was normal.
We will give you a script for occupational therapy.
