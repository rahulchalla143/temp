However, she was noted to continue to have problems with cognition and gait.
She had no illusions, delusions, or hallucination.
She had no focal neurological defects.
# Hyponatremia:  Cortisol and TSH levels were normal.
A CT Chest was obtained to look for possible pulmonary malignancy (pulmonary causes of SIADH).
It showed no evidence of any mass.
Hyponatremia resolved on conservative management.
We avoided the use of SSRI which could be responsible for her hyponatremia.
#Cognitive impairment with gait abnormality with DDX of Delirium, frontal dementia, or normal pressure hydrocephalus.
She may need brain MRI if symptoms progress.
However, most of her symptoms can be explained by depression and her OSH CT head was unremarkable.

We avoided the initiation of new antidepressants in the hospital as we need to monitor their effects on her.
Weight loss: may be related to underlying depression or see above.
Then we restarted Glyburide and placed Metformin on hold secondary to significant GI symptoms.
