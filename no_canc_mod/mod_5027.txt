Admission Date:  [**2138-11-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-11-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: pelvic fracture  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 26585**] is a French Creole speaking [**Age over 90 **] M with recent pelvic fracture who developed aspiration pneumonia and now is admitted to the ICU with hypoxia.
He was saturating well on the medical floor until 2 days ago when he had an aspiration event and became slightly hypoxic.
Since his chest x ray was unchanged, it was hypothesized that his new A-a gradient was due to a pulmonary embolism.
A CTA cannot be obtained because of the patient's renal failure and a V/Q scan would not be useful since his baseline CXR shows infiltrates.
Past Medical History: diabetes II, hep B and hep C  Social History: He has been a preacher for several years.
[**Name (NI) **] smoking, no drinking.
CT pelvis [**11-13**]: 7 x 4 cm right iliacus hematoma likely secondary to small nondisplaced right iliac bone fracture.
2.Superior and inferior right pubic rami fractures.
Ascites and soft tissue third spacing, a moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
Multiple hypodense renal lesions, likely cysts, the smallest too small to definitively characterize.
CXR [**11-21**]: A new consolidation is seen in the right lower lung having relatively sharp contours with elevation of right hemidiaphragm and downward displacement of the right hila, most likely representing new atelectasis.
The left retrocardiac atelectasis and left pleural effusion are unchanged.
There is no evidence of failure or pneumothorax.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 26585**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old male admitted after a fall resulting in pelvic fracture with subsequent development of a multi-lobar pneumonia and fluid overload with bilateral pleural effusions and total body edema.
His pneumonia was treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and clindamycin given unclear source of pulmonary infiltrate.
For volume overload, he received furosemide intravenously as needed and he diuresed appropriately.
DISPENSE: 30ml REFILLS: none   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: hip fracture aspiration pneumonia hepatitis B hepatitis C renal failure diabetes hypertension   Discharge Condition: Patient with poor prognosis overall, goals of care discussed, and family and patient wish to discontinue agressive care measures.
