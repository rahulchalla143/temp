No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
V, VII: Facial strength and sensation slightly superior on right versus left though both intact.
With very slight facial droop on right.
Left lower extremity with minimal movement and left upper extremity with 2/5 finger extension.
Slight left sided facial droop.
Interval increase in caliber of the ventricular system, with suggestion of periventricular white matter low attenuation, which could reflect transependymal flow of CSF.
Stable area of encephalomalacia in the right temporoparietal and occipital lobes.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2152-10-23**], the mitral and aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but without discrete vegetation.
Mitral regurgitation severity is similar.
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or greater, a TEE is suggested to better define the valve leaflets.
Persistent sulcal effacement, particularly in the right frontal lobe suggestive of mild edema.
Compared to [**2155-5-1**] study, there is no significant change in size and configuration of the lateral or third ventricles.
Moderate periventricular white matter hypodensity is unchanged, with no evidence of transependymal migration of CSF.
Diffuse sulcal effacement is stable in appearance.
There is a large area of cystic encephalomalacia involving right temporoparietal lobe.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
No change in size or configuration of the lateral and third ventricles compared to [**2155-5-1**].
Unchanged diffuse sulcal effacement.
No hemorrhage.
Head CT [**5-7**]: FINDINGS: There is large-volume pneumocephalus in bilateral anterior frontal horns and in the right temporal region.
There has been interval redistribution of pneumocephalus which may have slightly decreased in size compared to the previous examination.
Large-volume fluid collection in the right temporal lobe with encephalomalacia appears stable.
There is diffuse sulcal effacement likely due to the presence of mild hydrocephalus and large-volume pneumocephalus.
The right frontal and right temporal approach catheters' tips terminate in the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and right posterior septum pellucidum respectively.
No areas of acute hemorrhage are present.
Hypodensities are present in the white matter in bilateral frontal horns likely due to the presence of transependymal flow.
Stable appearance to large-volume pneumocephalus which has undergone mild re-distribution.
Broad distribution sulcal effacement due to large-volume pneumocephalus which appears stable.
Borderline low voltage.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 87 136 80 342/389 60 7 80  CT Head [**5-12**]: FINDINGS: There is decreased pneumocephalus compared to the previous examination.
There is unchanged large fluid collection in the right temporoparietal lobe status post right parietotemporal lobe resection with encephalomalacia.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears unchanged with persistent sulcal and gyral effacement.
Paranasal sinuses, ethmoid and mastoid air cells remain well aerated.
Slight interval decrease in volume of pneumocephalus with stable ventricular size.
Stable appearance to [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation, no areas of hemorrhage.
No intraluminal thrombus is seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT seen in either lower extremity.
She has a history of R temporoparietal resection with left sided weakness at baseline.
Patient returns to ER on [**4-19**] complaining of headaches on bending that was first noticed 3 weeks ago.
CT scan revealed mild to moderate increase in ventricular size with VP shunt catheter in place.
Patient was then taken to the OR for suspected shunt infection and cultures were obtained.
Removal of right frontal ventricular catheter.
On [**4-21**], Na level drops from 125-120 and patient placed on 2gm salt tabs, fluid restrictions of 500cc, and 3% hypertonic solution at 20/hr.
Patient became more lethargic and disoriented on [**4-22**], CT scan in AM showed hydrocephalus and EVDs were dropped to 5 cmH2O.
Follow up CT scan showed interval decrease in ventricle size from previous scan.
