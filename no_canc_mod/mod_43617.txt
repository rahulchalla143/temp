Xrays showed open tib-fib comminuted fracture, calcaneal fracture.
She had a suspected right sided fracture as well.
Labs in ED were notable for elevated K (6.7) and acute on chronic renal failure (Cr 3.2).
For pain she was given 2mg dilaudid.
She was taken directly from ED to OR pre-op area.
She was transferred to the MICU due to difficulties extubating.
It was felt to be due to increased secretions.
An EKG did not show any peaked T waves or new changes.

No e/o facial asymmetry.
Pertinent Results: EKG: Pre-OP: Sinus bradycardia; no ST segment changes or q waves.
Post-OP: NSR, no peaked T waves, no acute ST changes.
No joint effusion is detected.
[**2154-1-5**] CT Chest: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The lungs show mild dependent atelectasis.
No pneumothorax, pleural or pericardial effusion is identified.
The heart is enlarged and demonstrates coronary artery calcification.
No intra-abdominal free air, free fluid, or lymphadenopathy is identified.
Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel maintain normal caliber without evidence of obstruction.
No free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesion is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intra-abdominal parenchymal organ injury.
[**2154-1-5**] Tib/Fib: AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE TIBIA AND FIBULA: Overlying splint obscures fine detail.
There is a comminuted fracture of the distal tibia and fibula.
Additional fractures are identified involving the plantar surface of the calcaneus as well as the proximal fibula.
There is an endotracheal tube with distal tip is at the level of the clavicles, 4.5 cm above the carina.
There is persistent cardiomegaly and mediastinal prominence which is unchanged since the previous study.
There is no focal consolidation or signs of overt pulmonary edema.
Exam is somewhat limited by motion, however, no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
A 3-mm rounded sclerotic focus is seen within the left mandibular condyle, which may represent a bone island, however, correlation with history of malignancy is recommended.
[**1-15**] RIGHT ANKLE: There is a large medial fracture plate in the distal tibia fixating a fracture through the distal tibia.
There is also a compound complex fracture of the distal fibula.
The tibiotalar joint is slightly widened medially.
There is generalized osteopenia.
There is soft tissue swelling.
LEFT ANKLE: External fixation hardware is seen within the tibial shaft and in the calcaneus.
There is a complex fracture involving the tibial metaphysis with multiple fracture fragments within the central portion of the bone.
There is also a complex fracture of the distal fibular shaft at the same level.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and, basal and distal inferior wall, and mid anterior wall.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (multivessel CAD or other diffuse process).
Mild- moderate mitral regurgitation.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Hematocrit at discharge was 26   Brief Hospital Course: A/P [**1-8**]: 75F h/o CAD, DM2, CKD, presented to ED s/p fall at nursing home with open L tib/fib fracture, s/p external fixation left, right comminuted closed tib/fib difficulty extubating post-OP [**3-16**] increased secretions, transferred to ICU for monitoring on ventilator.
# LEFT OPEN TIB/FIB FRACTURE / RIGHT CLOSED ANKLE FRACTURE  Sustained after falling out of bed at rehab.
# Respiratory failure  Transferred to Medical ICU post-operatively for failure to wean from ventilator.
Chest x-ray  revealed left retrocardiac opacity and a left-sided pleural effusion.
Sputum gram stain with gram positive cocci but culture negative.
Given concern for infection, pt was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole IV, and was continued on cefazolin for prophylaxis s/p external fixation.
She also has a history of CHF (EF 40% on [**1-7**]).
She was diuresed with furosemide to relieve pulmonary vascular congestion with good effect.
# Enterococcus UTI  Urine culture on [**2154-1-5**] grew enterococcus for, she completed 7 days of treatment with vancomycin, the culture was pan sesnitive.
# Delirium  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was extubated on [**1-10**] after which she time she experienced agitation and delirium which was thought to be due to a combination of post-injury/ post-operative pain, multiple tubes and lines/drains as well as underlying medical issues.
The chronic pain service was involved and their recommendations were implemented in an effort to control pain and minimize delirium.
# Chronic Kidney Disease  Ms. [**Known lastname 102520**] baseline is 1.8-2.1 bur on admission was 3.2 on admission.
She was scheduled outpatient follow up with nephrology for continued following of her renal function.
# DEPRESSION - on Celexa .
# OSTEOPENIA - Likely secondary to CKD; alk phos nml; pth pending.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Hydromorphone 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed: as needed for breakthrough pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left tibia and fibula fracture Right ankle fracture Left ankle fracture Delirium Enterococcus UTI   Discharge Condition: Alert and oriented times 3 Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with left leg and bilateral ankle fractures.
After your surgery you developed a urine infection and delirium which resolved.
You have follow up appointments with Orthopedics in a few weeks to have your stitches removed and to determinte course of action.
Return to the ER if any further worrisome symptoms, otherwise all yur appointments have been set up for you.
