The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**12-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A slightly-eccentric, posteriorly-directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
[**2122-3-25**] ECHO Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction septal dyskinesis.
There is moderate to severe hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 20 %).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate or worse ([**1-11**]+) dynamic mitral regurgitation is seen.
The jet is central and worsens with provactive manuvers (tberg, phenylepherine, increasing sbp > 140 mm Hg).
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion and pericardial calcifications are noted.
Peak gradient< 5 mm Hg with no regurgitatio or perivavluar flow.
There is an annuloplasty ring in the tricuspid position with no regurgitation, peak gradient 2-3 mm Hg, and no perivavluar flow.
There is unchanged biventricular function, LVEF 20-25% with septal dyskinesis.
Post-surgical changes in the chest status post valve replacement with a small amount of residual pneumomediastinum.
Moderate pericardial effusion, likely hemorrhagic.
Markedly enlarged heart with marked dilatation of the right atrium.
Small right and moderate left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.
No intra-abdominal or intrapelvic abscesses or fluid collection or obstruction.
Post-surgical change in the liver status post partial hepatectomy.
Mild periportal fluid tracking.
Mild dilatation of the main pancreatic duct of uncertain significance.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2122-3-23**] for surgical management of her mitral and tricuspid valve disease.
Given her past history of a partial liver resection, the liver service was consulted.
No increased risk was identified from a liver standpoint and she was cleared for surgery.
Her bleeding gradually slowed and stopped.
An echo revealed no significant pericardial effusion.
