HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2150**].
The patient has had chronic stable angina increasing in frequency over the last week.
Patient was admitted on [**2166-9-15**], with 8 out of 10 chest pain to an outside hospital, transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization.
The patient at that time ruled in for a myocardial infarction with positive troponins and CK MBs.
Catheterization showed ejection fraction of 50%, 100% native LAD disease, 90% thrombotic OM1 lesion, 100% proximal RCA lesion, occluded saphenous vein graft to OM1 and LIMA to LAD small but filling the distal LAD.
In the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory patient underwent PTCA to the OM with no stent placement and was admitted for observation.
At the time patient was chest pain free.
On [**9-16**] the patient began complaining of back pain radiating to his chest wall and jaw.
Electrocardiogram at that time showed increased ST depression.
The patient at that time also began experiencing a low grade fever.
The patient returned to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on [**9-16**] for recurrent ischemia.
On the evening of [**9-16**] patient again complained of chest pain, at times 10 out of 10.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2150**] and status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to left anterior descending artery in [**2154**].
History of ulcerative colitis.
History of Barrett's esophagus.
Status post hemorrhoid banding.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
On the evening of postoperative day zero, patient had elevated temperature to 103.1 degrees.
The patient continued to have fevers of 101.
No transfusions were given at that time.
Patient continued to have low grade fevers 100-101.
All cultures that had been sent continued to be negative with the exception of a sputum culture that had Gram positive cocci, Gram positive rods, epithelial cells and PMMs consistent with oropharyngeal flora.
The patient was started on diltiazem infusion for control of his heart rate with moderate results.
On postoperative day four patient continued on diltiazem infusion at 20 mg an hour and atrial fibrillation with heart rate of 120.
Also on postoperative day four patient was noted to have a rising white blood cell count.
No need for anticoagulation as the patient had converted into sinus rhythm unless the patient had further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
Also on postoperative day four patient had been complaining of three to four day history of curtain over vision in right eye.
It was determined that the patient had a postoperative optic neuropathy.
Patient continued to have low grade fevers and an elevated white blood cell count.
Right upper extremity vascular ultrasound was obtained to rule out deep venous thrombosis.
This was negative for any evidence of thrombosis.
The Infectious Disease team continued to remain concerned about the leukocytosis and low grade temperatures.
On postoperative day eight a Gastroenterology consult was obtained for colonoscopy to rule out ischemic colon.
Colonoscopy was performed on postoperative day 11 which showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, descending colon and splenic flexure.
No evidence of active colitis and otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to the transverse colon.
Also without evidence of Clostridium difficile.
Also on postoperative day eight, a Psychiatry consult was obtained because of patient's complaint of stress and anxiety.
On postoperative day 13 after discussions with the Infectious Disease team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**], it was felt that as the patient had no positive cultures and the white blood cell count was down, the suspected source for the elevated leukocytosis was the thrombophlebitis and the patient would be safe for discharge to home on oral levofloxacin for two weeks.
Coronary artery disease.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
Postoperative fever of unknown origin.
Postoperative leukocytosis.
Postoperative thrombophlebitis.
Heart regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
Gastrointestinal:  Abdomen soft, non-tender, non-distended, positive bowel sounds, no further diarrhea.
There was mild erythema at the insertion point of the staples which is consistent with normal postoperative staple reaction.
There was no further erythema or drainage.
