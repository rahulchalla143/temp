Admission Date:  [**2131-12-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-1-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2087-6-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**] Chief Complaint: SOB and R arm swelling  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R AV fistula ligation   History of Present Illness: Pt.
is a 44 y/o with a hx of ESRD on HD (Tu, Th, Sat), Type II DM, who p/w SOB x 2 day and R arm pain x 2 weeks.
reports she has had SOB with exertion since returning from HD on Tuesday.
Reports she has been getting a cold for the last week, with rhinorrhea and cough productive of yellow sputum.
Says she has had similar episodes of SOB in the past "when I get fluid overloaded from dialysis" but that she has been regular about HD so doesn't know why she would be fluid overloaded now.
also reports getting a R AV fistula placed 1 month ago.
She reports her arm has been becoming painful and swollen for the past 2 weeks.
Says occasionally she'll get pain shooting from elbow to R thumb, and sometimes her R hand goes numb if she sleeps on her R, but otherwise denies weakness or numbness in R hand.
reports "leaky valves" Sleep Apnea -> CPAP, Home O2 PRN CVA [**8-19**] with residual L arm and leg weakness   Social History: No EtOH, hx tobacco quit 1 year ago, used to smoke 3 ppd x 33 years.
Lives with cousin, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 26707**], on disability  Family History: Adopted, unknown  Physical Exam: VS: 96.8 116 167/93 18 99% on 2L Gen: A+O, sitting on stretcher in NAD HEENT: EOMI, PERRL CV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, harsh 4/6 systolic murmer Lungs: decreased BS at bases bilat, mild bibasilar crackles Abd: obese, soft, NTND, +BS Ext: fistula in R forearm, +thrill, R arm markedly swollen from elbow to shoulder, TTP in this area.
+ radial pulse bilat  Pertinent Results: CTA Chest [**2131-12-26**]: 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Congestive heart failure with mild bilateral pleural effusions.
3) Nonspecific borderline mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
4) Tiny ill defined alveolar opacities in the anterior left upper lobe anteriorly, nonspecific; possibly infectious in nature; these should be reassessed to ensure resolution.
Right upper extremity venous ultrasound and Doppler examination, [**2131-12-26**]: Examination of the right internal jugular, right subclavian, right axillary, paired brachial and basilic veins shows no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
A very limited evaluation of the fistula suggests that it is patent.
Limited outflow of the AV fistula through multiple collaterals in the arm, shoulder and thoracic wall.
Based on MRI, decision to attempt further venous recanalization under anesthesia could be considered.
MRI/MRA Chest [**2132-1-2**]: MRA of the thorax shows normal pulmonary arteries bilaterally without central filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolus.
The left ventricle wall appears mildly thickened raising the question of left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending and descending aorta have a normal appearance without aneurysmal dilatation, ulcer, or large amount of atherosclerosis.
Bilateral common carotid arteries are widely patent proximally and patent to their bifurcations.
The left vertebral artery appears slightly dominant.
No concerning lesions within the arteries.
The caliber of the vessel at this level measures between 3 and 9 mm with multiple areas of stenosis.
The left subclavian vein is markedly irregular with moderate stenoses but remains patent to the left brachiocephalic vein.
Within the left lateral subclavian vein are some filling defects that could represent chronic thrombus that are nonocclusive.
There is minimal contrast around the dialysis catheter throughout its course within the brachiocephalic vein and superior SVC, which is narrowed superiorly, however there is slow flow around the catheter.
Large number of venous collaterals shunting venous blood from the neck and bilateral upper extremities around the bilateral subclavian vein and brachiocephalic vein stenoses.
Collaterals are seen within anterior chest walls bilaterally, left much greater than right, within the posterior thorax including the intercostal veins and within the supraclavicular veins bilaterally.
There are multiple bilateral enlarged axillary lymph nodes, which are nonspecific and were seen on the recent CT scan.
No definite abnormalities are seen within the upper abdomen on limited evaluation.
Multifocal high-grade stenosis within the right subclavian vein centrally and right brachiocephalic vein.
These vessels are patent though there is slow flow through them with large venous collaterals.
Moderate stenoses within the left subclavian vein and minimal flow through the left brachiocephalic vein about the patient's dialysis catheter as well as in the superior SVC which is slightly narrowed.
These lumens are patent, however there is decreased flow as evidenced by delayed filling and the extensive collaterals.
Bilateral jugular vein occlusion inferiorly.
8.6 cm fat-containing lesion within the right latissimus dorsi does contain soft tissue elements and therefore is not definitely a simple lipoma.
Right greater than left axillary lymphadenopathy is non-specific and clinical correlation is recommended .
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Findings most consistent with congestive heart failure.
New bibasilar opacities, probably atelectases.
Brief Hospital Course: SOB:  CTA showed findings c/w CHF.
A TTE was checked and showed and EF of 75% with moderate LV outflow obstruction, [**12-17**]+ MR, and mild PA hypertension, and high outflow CHF [**1-17**] her AV fistula was thought to contribute to SOB.
Pulmonary was consulted re: PA HTN contributing to SOB and recommended PFTs, which showed a restrictive defect, as well as a RA ABG, which showed a pH of 7.39, PO2 73, PCO2 46, HCO3 29.
PA HTN was also thought to contribute to her SOB.
was transferred to the MICU on [**1-5**] for hypotension and hypoxia, especially given known UE thrombi, however repeat CTA was negative for PE.
was found to have high output CHF, making her pro-load dependant.
On [**1-5**] she became hypotensive and hypoxic, and was transferred to the MICU for further management.
All blood cultures were negative, so this episode was thought be be [**1-17**] decreased pre-load from decreased PO intake and fluid removal at HD, and not sepsis.
However given clinical concern for thrombosis, this was followed up with an AV fistulogram which showed central subclavian occlusion.
Transplant was reconsulted and again recommended no intervention.
Therefore interventional radiology was consulted re: recanalization of R subclavian vein.
They recommended an MRI/MRV prior to intervention, and this was obtained (see results above) and showed bilateral thrombi and stenoses.
also developed LUE swelling, due to L sided clots.
was transferred to the MICU for infusion of tPA overnight, and recanalization was attempted again on [**1-10**], again unsuccessfully.
Type II DM: Actos was held given concern for fluid retention, pt.
Secondary Diagnosis Type II DM, retinopathy ESRD on HD HTN Pre-eclampsia CHF: EF 75% Sleep Apnea: CPAP CVA [**8-19**] with L arma and leg weakness   Discharge Condition: Good, vitals stable, patient ambulating and eating,   Discharge Instructions: Seek medical services immediately if you should have any fevers, chills, worsening upper extremity swelling or any other worrisome sympmtom.
