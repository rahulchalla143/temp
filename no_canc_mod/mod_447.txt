CTA Chest Final Report REASON FOR EXAM: Shortness of breath.
Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also submitted for interpretation.
FINDINGS: CHEST CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The non-contrast CT demonstrates no intramural hematoma within the aorta.
CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no filling defect in the pulmonary arterial tree to suggest the present of a pulmonary embolism.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
Previously noted pleural effusions have resolved.
Minimal atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta is noted.
The aorta is normal in course and caliber and there i no evidence of dissection.
Mildly prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are identified which measure up to 1- cm in short axis are likely reactive.
Minimal soft tissue attenuating material within the anterior mediastinum may represent residual thymus.
There is no pneumothorax.
There has been near complete resolution of the ground glass opacities withi the lungs.
There is minimal residual ground-glass patchy consolidation in the right middle lobe (3:77) and anterior segment of the right upper lobe (3:49).
Additional smaller foci of ground-glass nodularity are seen but compared to prior CT, there has been significant improvement.
The upper abdominal organs including the partially visualized liver, spleen, pancreas and left adrenal appear grossly unremarkable.
There is no definite acute displaced fracture.
Again noted are right-sided sixth and fifth rib deformity which may represent old fractures.
No pulmonary embolism.
Near complete resolution of previously noted multifocal pneumonia.
Mildly prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, likely reactive, slightly decreased in size from prior CT.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral and mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2132-11-20**], the severity of tricuspid and mitral regurgitation have increased slightly.
CXR Final Report REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient with parenchymal opacities.
There is gradual improvement up to practically complete resolution of bilateral right more than left opacities with only minimal left basilar opacity seen on the current study and that might represent area of lingular atelectasis.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax and the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
Final Report TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest PA and lateral.
INDICATION: Peripheral eosinophilia and questionable acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
Likewise, pulmonary vasculature without evidence of congestion.
No signs of new parenchymal infiltrates.
The minimal linear peripheral densities in the left lung base are still present, but comparison suggests that they have further regressed.
Further comparison demonstrates that the most prominent acute infiltrates in the right upper lobe area of [**8-3**] have disappeared and not reoccurred.
IMPRESSION: Stable chest findings with minimal peripheral thin atelectasis on left base.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern5) 3250**] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 3251**] Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2144-8-27**] 5:54 PM    Imaging Lab    Brief Hospital Course: 47F with remote h/o asthma p/w progressive SOB/DOE, pleuritic CP, fatigue, and hypoxia with eosinophilia after recent admission for pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin now with resolved infiltrates.
# Hypoxic respiratory distress with peripheral eosinophilia: The patient has persistent hypoxia associated with palpable sternal chest pain which was also pleuritic.
CXR and CTA chest showed no significant infiltrate, PE, or other parenchymal lung disease, which was markedly improved from her last recent CT which showed multifocal PNA.
She had peripheral eos of 25, which resolved for one day after ED gave 1x steroids due to concern for asthma flare.
Notably, pt had reaction on prior admission to zosyn with rash, but this eosinophilia was felt to less likely related to that reaction given temporal history.
An acute diffusion gradient etiology is less likely given CT chest without significant pathology, although given peripheral eosinophilia, AEP/CEP was thought to be a possibility.
Her pleuritic CP was most consistent with an inflammatory vs post-infectious cause as CTA did not show PE.
The patient reported that her pain improved over the course of the day ([**8-24**]) with morphine, ketorolac, and acetominophen.
She received albuterol and ipratropium nebs and her sats improved to room air without desats while walking.
She had one episode of decreased BP overnight after 4 mg morphine, but she maintained good UOP, normal mental status, warm extremities.
TTE showed mild/mod TR worsened from before but normal EF.
Pulmonary team recommended spirometry and they initially felt it was unclear if peripheral eosinophilia is related to pulmonary process but rapid response of eos as well as infiltrates suggest may be related.
Differential diagnosis of pulmonary eosinophilia includes AEP,CEP, CSS, parasitic infection, HP, ABPA, and Loffler's syndrome.
Parasitic infection less likely given lack of travel history although transient oulmonary infiltrates and peripheral eos consistent with parasitic infection.
Coccidioides can also cause EP but has not had travel history.
HP possible given new environment since [**Month (only) **] but had initial worsneing at rehab.
On the medicine floor, the pt did not have any episodes of desat and was maintained comfortably on room air, with percocet, ibuprofen, tylenol with improved pain relief.
Bronch apparently (not on OMR) showed thick mucous secretions and concern for aspergillous vs eosinophilic PNA.
She had blood tests sent for aspergillous galactomannan antibody and IgE were sent and are pending.
She was started on 20mg prednisone for likely chronic eos PNA (CEP) with followup with pulmonary clinic which they will schedule.
no active issues.

You were found to have a high peripheral eosinophil count, and although your lungs improved on chest xray, the pulmonary team was concerned that you might have developed eosinophilic pneumonia.
You had a bronchoscopy performed which showed mucous secretions, and biopsies/fluid samples were obtained.
You should also take prednisone for your eosinophilic pneumonia with albuterol/ipratropium inhaler as needed for shortness of breath.
Please do not hesitate to return to the hospital for any concerning symptoms at all.
