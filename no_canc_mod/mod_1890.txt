The hematoma extends to the level of the pubic symphysis superiorly, and to the distal femur/knee inferiorly.
Additionally, high-density fluid fills the gluteus maximus muscle posteriorly.
Fat stranding is seen throughout the imaged left leg.
On post-contrast imaging, there was no evidence of arterial active bleed.
There are diffuse vascular calcifications.
BONE WINDOWS: Mild degenerative changes are seen.
There is no visible disruption of the cortex, periosteal reaction, or sinus tract within the left femur to indicate osteomyelitis.
Degenerative changes are seen along the pubic symphysis, bilateral hips.
There are diffuse vascular calcifications.
IMPRESSION: 1) Large left hematoma, without CT evidence of active bleeding.
If arterial source is clinically suspected this should be evaluated with conventional angiography.
2) No bony changes to suggest the presence of an abscess, or osteomyelitis.
Reasons for this could include recent instrumentation, recent removal of Foley catheter, versus infectious etiology.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-5-16**] 5:37 PM PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The study is extremely limited secondary to difficulty with patient positioning.
There is an opacity in the left lower lobe, which may represent pneumonia.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
Additionally, there appears to be a small left pleural effusion.
No evidence of obstruction.
No evidence of toxic megacolon.
There is probably a small bilateral pleural effusion.
Patchy opacity is seen in the left lower lobe.
If clinically indicated, please evaluate with chest x-rays.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: 56yo M with tonsillar cancer, recurrent aspiration penumonia, ventilator dependent, diabetes who presented with sepsis and acute hematocrit drop with goal of care comfort measures only  #ID:The patient initially presented with leukocytosis, fever, 18% bandemia but with lactate 1.9 with possible sources including cdiff, LLL PNA, and UTI.
His stool cultures were pending but he had diarrhea in the setting of recent antibiotics and thus flagyl for possible Cdiff was started.
After this decision was made, pt's sputum culture was found to have klebsiella sensitive to only imipenum and meropenum and pansensitive pseudomonas resistant only to ciprofloxacin.
#anemia- The patient was found to be anemic believed to be secondary to a hematoma in the left medial thigh.
A CT scan of his left thigh showed a hematoma with suspected ongoing bleed based on appearance.
Vascular surgery was consulted as well for potential surgical intervention, however family wished for no invasive procedures, only supportive care.
He was treated prn with anti-anxiety medications.
Ativan 2 mg/mL Solution Sig: 1-5mg  Injection every 4-6 hours as needed for aggitation.
Haldol 5 mg/mL Solution Sig: 0.5-1  Injection every 4-6 hours as needed for aggitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Tonsillar cancer Aspiration pneumonia (klebsiella and pseudomonas)   Discharge Condition: Maintaining o2 sat from 95-100%  Discharge Instructions: Pt is comfort measures only.
