HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44 year old male with known coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial infarction and status post stenting of the right coronary artery in [**2117-12-4**].
The catheterization at that time also demonstrated multiple lesions of the left anterior descending and left circumflex.
Subsequently he was stable and underwent a second catheterization in [**2118-12-4**] because of more recurrent chest pain, which showed good result in the right coronary artery, no change in the left coronary artery lesion.
Since then he continued on a stable course until the past week when he developed progressive episodes of chest pain.
The pain began to occur at rest and it was not relieved with Nitroglycerin sublingual.
Coronary artery disease; myocardial infarction in 12/[**2117**].
Status post left ankle surgery.
Neck shows no lymphadenopathy, no bruits.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm with no murmur.
No evidence of ischemia.
This revealed 90% stenosis of the right coronary artery, 70% stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending, mid-LAD, and 70% stenosis of the diagonal 1, 70% stenosis of the proximal circumflex and 90% stenosis of the obtuse marginal 1.
