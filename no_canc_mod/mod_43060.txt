/ Lipitor  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: headaches  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: arterial line [**2168-10-9**]   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]y F with history notable for bilateral SDH s/p evac here at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2166**] as well as chronic, recurrent non-migrainous headaches, hypertension, and remote h/o migraine HA.
It had been going on for several days at that time, with only partial relief from Fioricet and Motrin, and a one-day spell of relief during a brief stay at [**Hospital1 **] where she got Reglan.
Stopping the amlodipine did not seem to have any effect on the HA.
The ED staff planned to admit to Medicine ICU ([**Hospital Unit Name 153**]) for blood pressure control, but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] noticed that she was in the ED and visited and recommended that we could admit to our Neuro-ICU service since we are familiar with the patient and he is attending on the inpatient service this week.
Her daughter is concerned about the situation and there is some disagreement between her and the patient about the desired amount of diagnosis and treatment -- patient requests DNR/DNI and does not want, e.g., CTA or potential coil/clipping if she were found to have an aneurysm.
Past Medical History: 1. remote h/o migraine HAs 2. bilateral SDH/hygromas [**4-/2166**] s/p evacuation and resolution; no Neurologic sequelae except intermittent vertex HAs since that time, including this week.
3. h/o DM2, but this was apparently related to hydrocortisone use for her low back pain; her daughter explained that the patient stopped requiring any diabetes medications since discontinuing the hydrocortisone (and also lost 10-20lbs recently).
Hypertension on [**Last Name (un) **], BB, and recently started on CCB (the day before the headache started).
Chronic anemia, on FeSO4 (not taking) and EPO injections (taking).
Chronic renal failure, which her daughter says was [**2-10**] adverse reaction to Prilosec.
- denies any h/o stroke, TIA, MI, CAD  Social History: no tobacco, ETOH   Family History: Family History is notable for many relatives esp.
No scleral icterus.

Neck: Supple, with minimally restricted range of motion; no rigidity.
Warm and well-perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
c/o pain at both UE from BP cuff.
There were no paraphasic errors.
No evidence of apraxia or neglect or ideomotor apraxia; the patient was able to reproduce and recognize brushing hair with right hand; used fingers/hand to represent toothbrush on brushing teeth with left hand.
Left-right confusion as before; touched her left ear with her left hand instead of R ear with Left hand.
III, IV, VI: EOMs full and conjugate with no nystagmus.
No saccadic intrusion during smooth pursuits.
VII: No ptosis, no flattening of either nasolabial fold.
VIII: Hearing intact and subjectively equal to finger-rub bilaterally; worse hearing loss on Left vs. extinguishes on Left.
-Motor: No pronator drift, and no parietal up-drift bilaterally.
Mild resting tremor Left>right, less pronounced than 1wk ago.
Normal muscle bulk and tone, no flaccidity.
Mild hypertonicity of RLE.

Joint position sense minimally impaired in both both great toes and subtly in RUE (missed nose initially; may have been [**2-10**] compression from BP cuff which I just deflated before test).
- Cortical sensory testing: No agraphesthesia or astereoagnosia.
No extinction.
-Reflex examination (left; right): Biceps (++;++) Triceps  (++;++) Brachioradialis (++;++) Quadriceps / patellar (++;++) Gastroc-soleus / achilles (0;0) Plantar response was mute bilaterally.
-Coordination: Finger-nose-finger testing with no dysmetria or intention tremor, mild tremor.
Heel-knee-shin testing with no dysmetria.
-Gait: deferred, given the labile BP and pt preference ______________________________________________________________ Discharge Examination: No change from initial examination except for variable orientation: oriented to name and place but not month, year, or hospital name.
Post-SDH evacuation changes in the bilateral frontal calvarium.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 2127**] [**Known lastname 1968**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with PMHx of bilateral SDH/hygromas in [**2166**] s/p evacuation and resolution, DM, HTN, HL and hypothyroidism who presented with HA x2 weeks and hypertensive urgency, thought to be causing the headaches.
She developed orthostasis the next day, but this resolved quickly with intravenous fluids and the holding of her blood pressure medications.
# Cardiovascular:  she did not have any events on telemetry while here.
# Hematology/Oncology: patient has known mild anemia, is on EPO as an outpatient.
# Endocrine: we continued patient's L-thyroxine, however her TSH was mildly elevated at 4.9.
# Nephrology/Urologic: pt has known chronic kidney disease, which began with Prilosec treatment and per daughter plateaued and improved after withdrawal of this medication.
We monitred her potassium and BUN/Cr, which remained increased after starting furosemide, likely also with a contribution of volume depletion.
[ ] Please recheck her electrolytes to monitor her potassium and creatinine.
