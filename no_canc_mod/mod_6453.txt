Admission Date:  [**2130-9-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-9-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-4-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: A.C.E Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: cardiac arrest, transferred from OSH for cooling  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body Left subclavian line placement Arterial line placement   History of Present Illness: 50yo M with history of possible diabetes and hepatitis C found down by EMS in asystole with low BS.
He developed Vfib and was defibrillated x 1 and resumed SR.
He presented to OSH ED in bradycardia and given more atropine.
Pt was transferred from OSH ([**Hospital3 **]) to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac arrest hypothermia protocol.
Of note, pt was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] for hypoglycemia with similar presentation FS=17.
Pt found down in field and admitted for management of glucose levels.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], he was placed on Arctic Sun Protocol with rectal and esophageal temp probe.
Past Medical History: 1) Hypertension 2) Diabetes Mellitus (on U-500 insulin) - recent hospitalization at [**Hospital3 **] for hypoglycemia 3) Diabetic retinopathy 4) Bipolar Disorder 5) Chronic Back Pain 6) Right eye blindness 7) Hyperkalemia from ACE-inhibitor 8) Depression 9) Bilateral cataracts  Social History: SOCIAL HISTORY: unmarried, unemployed -Tobacco history:  unknwn -ETOH: -Illicit drugs:  Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION on admission: GENERAL: Intubated obese caucasian male, sedated wearing C-collar HEENT: small abrasion on R forehead; Anisocoria R>L pupil size NECK: cervical collar in place CARDIAC: very distant heart sound, No apparent m/r/g.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: +edema in all extremities, nonpitting GU: very small penis with inferior pinpoint urethral meatus SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Studies: ECG Study Date of [**2130-9-2**] Sinus rhythm with first degree atrio-ventricular conduction delay.
Tented T waves in the anterior precordial leads.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.
This raises the possibility of contusion or possible pneumonia.
Volume loss in the left upper lobe could also be considered.
There is a virtually gasless abdomen except for some gas within the colon.
Although there is no evidence of obstruction, if there is serious clinical concern for dilated, fluid-filled loops of bowel, CT would be necessary to definitely exclude an obstruction.
Right axis deviation is non-specific but cannot exclude left posterior fascicular block or possible right ventricular overload.
Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition.
Findings concerning for left upper lobe collapse and central/mediastinal adenopathy.
Recommend further evaluation with CT to evaluate for underlying malignancy.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2130-9-7**] FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarct, mass, mass effect or edema.
There is diffuse sinus disease with mucosal thickening of the bilateral maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses as well as the mastoid air cells.
There is calcification seen in the petrous portion of the right internal carotid artery.
There are no fractures seen.
Carotid artery calcifications.
There is mild degenerative disease with a bridging osteophyte seen at C3-C4 level.
There are no soft tissue abnormalities in the prevertebral and paravertebral spaces.
No cervical spine fracture seen.
Calcified internal carotid arteries.
Main pulmonary artery is dilated up to 4 cm, finding that might be consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
The mediastinum is shifted to the left due to the left upper lobe collapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates moderate to significant splenomegaly and otherwise is unremarkable within the limitations of this study that was not designed for evaluation of intra-abdominal pathology.
Right lower lobe posterior opacities most likely consistent with aspiration combined with atelectasis.
Left lower lobe area of atelectasis is noted posteriorly as well.
There are no bone lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm.
Complete collapse of left upper lobe as described in detailed.
Evaluation of the patient with bronchoscopy is highly recommended for therapeutic and if necessary diagnostic purposes since the obstruction might be either mucous plug or endobronchial neoplasm (less likely but cannot be entirely excluded).
Right lower lobe posterior opacity most likely a combination of atelectasis and aspiration.
Slightly too distal position of the tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery.
Mild cardiomegaly.
This finding corresponds to left upper lobe collapse as demonstrated on CT chest of [**2130-9-7**].
No pleural effusions, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Persistent left upper lobe collapse.
There is patchy left lower lobe volume loss in the retrocardiac region.
There is a small right effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 50yo Caucasian male with h/o DM, recent hospitalization for hypoglycemia, HTN, bipolar do, found down in the field with FS=46 and PEA arrest.
Pt defibrillated and no ST elevations on EKG noted.
EKG at OSH showed no ST segment elevations; cardiac enzymes were initially elevated CE at OSH (likely secondary to arrest) and trended downward.
ECHO was performed to eval for structural abnormalities which showed small, thick-walled left ventricle, LVEF 70-75%.
Head and spine CT showed no fracture or acute intracranial process.
However, Chest CT showed an obstruction of the left main bronchus, approximately 4.2 cm from the carina by a lesion of low density; the left upper lobe was completely collapsed with a low-density material seen in the bronchi (the appearance of "drowned lung").
Therapuetic and diagnostic bronchoscopy was recommended and performed which revealed that the patient had aspirate an insulin cap.
Hypoglycemia: Most likely contributed to PEA arrest.
Noted recent difficulty managing blood glucose levels, with recent admission to [**Hospital3 **] hospital for hypoglycemic episode.
DM managed on U-500 insulin and probable cause for hypoglycemia.
Pneumonia: Upon admission, there was concern for pneumonia (?aspiration) as he was found down in the field, chest xray findings were initially suggestive of infiltrate, and he was showing signs of SIRS.
He was intially started on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin, then transitioned to Vancomycin and Unasyn due to concern for anaerobic bacteria.
Patient continued to have fevers despite antibiotics, however fevers stopped after the insulin cap was removed, indicating he was likely having a localized inflammatory response to the foreign body obstruction rather than VAP.
Respiratory failure: Pt was unable to protect airway in setting of vfib arrest and collapse of LUL secondary to aspirated insulin cap.
Acute injury possible secondary to poor cardiac forward flow in setting of cardiac arrest.
s/p Fall: Pt found down in field, likely diagnosis hypoglycemia and PEA arrest.
Small abrasion on forehead likely [**2-7**] to fall trauma.
Anisocoria [**2-7**] blindness - unlikely to be an acute process.
CT head clear at OSH and repeat CT of head in house was negative for acute intracranial process.
CT of C-spine was negative for fracture.
Bipolar disorder: home divalproex acid initially was held in setting of hypothermia protocol.
Patient had some sedation when restarting/up-titrating depakote, he was seen by psychiatry to recommending switching to long acting depakote at bedtime.
An ammonia level was checked out of concern for depakote side effect and was normal.
Psychiatry recommended small standing PO dose of haldol at night for agitation as well.
Anemia and thrombocytopenia: Patient may have had mild HITT secondary to heparin as platelets normalized after heparin stopped.
Anemia etiology unknown, although may have been due to critical illness .
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Haloperidol 5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5-1 Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for agitation.
Calcium Carbonate 200 mg (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: [**1-7**] Tablet, Chewables PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for indigestion.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PEA Cardiac Arrest Hypoglycemic episode Acute Renal Failure Respiratory Failure Delerium   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were initially transferred here from [**Hospital 21242**] [**Hospital 107**] Hospital after you experienced a low blood sugar causing you to have a cardiac arrest.
You also required dialysis for your kidneys, as they experienced temporary dysfunction during hospitalization.
You experienced difficulty breathing during hospitalization.
The cap was removed, and your breathing improved, and we were able to wean you off mechanical ventilation.
- Aspirin was increased to 325 mg daily - Divalproex was changed to a long acting dose at 10pm - Oxycontin was decreased to 10 mg daily - Amlodipine was added for blood pressure control - Haldol was added to decrease your confusion at night - Calcium carbonate and Pantopriazole were added to treat heartburn type symptoms.
- colace was added to prevent constipation - Tylenol was added to treat your back and chest pain.
Please check your blood sugars when you wake up, before lunch, and before bedtime, and keep a journal for your doctor so that s/he can adjust your insulin adequately to prevent future hypoglycemic episodes.
