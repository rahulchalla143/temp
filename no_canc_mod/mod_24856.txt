There is multifocal interstitial and airspace opacification, not appreciably changed from the prior study, could represent a combination of congestive failure or even ARDS.
Dilated RV cavity.
Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Admitted [**2134-1-31**] for bridge from coumadin with heparin drip.
In the first few hours she had significant ventricular ectopy that was treated with amiodarone boluses and drip with improvement however underlying rhythm was complete heart block and continued to be paced with epicardial wires.
She remained intubated overnight for hemodynamics and was extubated the morning of postoperative day one.
She was started on lasix for diuresis due to pulmonary edema and continued amiodarone.
Electrophysiology was consulted for rhythm management and she was placed on lidocaine drip with improvement but continued runs on ventricular tachycardia that worsened with activity.
She continues with ventricular ectopy but no ventricular tachycardia.
She was restarted on coumadin for history of pulmonary embolism and atrial fibrillation.
She was continued to be diuresed for pulmonary edema, however was noted to have hyponatremia with sodium to 122 with no clear cause that was treated with hypertonic saline and saline tabs and sodium improved however pulmonary edema worsened.
Her oxygen requirements increased and she continued to require aggressive diuresis and non invasive ventilation for few days.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
18. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: Three (3) ml Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
