A double lumen right internal jugular venous catheter again terminates in the superior vena cava.
There is persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with a stable effusion and atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Stable small left-sided pleural effusion and elevation of left hemidiaphragm.
No spontaneous echo contrast in the body  of the LA.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
Severely dilated LV cavity.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed  given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with RV pressure overload.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Resting tachycardia for the patient.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No Flow across the Interatrial septum is seen.
A hypoechoic area is seen in the IAS.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly  thickened.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Bileaflet flail is seen, with a echogenicity consistent with subvalvular apparatus/vegetation attached to the anterior leaflet.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Trivial (normal for prosthesis) mitral regurgitation is seen, consistent with washing jets.
Systolic flattening of the septum is still seen.
[**Location (un) **] PHYSICIAN:   [**2191-7-11**] 06:25AM BLOOD Lipase-93*   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with Strep viridans mitral valve endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, and severe anemia.
1)MITRAL VALVE ENDOCARDITIS: Initial blood cultures remained positive for Streptococcus.
Echocardiogram was notable for partial anterior leaflet flail with a highly mobile, large (1.8 x 0.8cm) echogenic "mass" attached to the left atrial side of the anterior mitral leaflet c/w a vegetation.
A very small vegetation on the posterior leaflet was also suggested.
No abscess was seen and torn mitral chordae were present.
There was severe (4+) mitral regurgitation.
There was also moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation.
A Head CT scan and back MRI revealed no evidence of septic emboli.
Given markedly depressed right ventricular function and severely depressed cardiac indeces, he required placment of an IABP along with Dopamine for hemodynamic support.
Inotropic support was weaned without difficulty.
Also followed by Urology for urinary retention.
Etiology of his renal failure was most likely from septic emboli with immune mediated glomerulonephritis associated with strep-viridans bacteremia, possible contribution from ATN given relative hypotension at presentation.
Given his urinary retention, he most likely has an uretheral stricture or other bladder outlet obstruction.
Postoperatively, he remained dialysis dependent.
A tunnelled catheter was placed on [**6-28**] without complication.
3)ANEMIA: Diagnosed with normocytic anemia with no signs of iron deficiency or hemolysis.
Most likely from chronic inflammation in setting of SBE, though HCT 18% on presentation was alarming.
MR L spine and skeletal survey to evaluate for malignancy were negative.
Postoperatively, he remained anemic and continued to require PRBC with hemodialysis.
