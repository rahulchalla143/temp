Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1) Incision and drainage of right clavicle region abscess.
4) T12-L3 laminectomy and epidural abscess debridement.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Epidural abscess: MRI of the lumbar spine showed epidural abscess.
Pt tolerated the procedure well without post-op complication except expected pain.
She did not have any further fevers and continued on IV antibiotics--plan for total 6 week course.
She was changed back from cefazolin to oxacillin for improved activity against MSSA and thinking that the nafcillin had not been responsible for her anemia.
2) Anemia: In addition, pt had a drop in Hct that was gradual but without clear etiology.
It was likely a combination of blood loss anemia from surgery and anemia of chronic disease.
