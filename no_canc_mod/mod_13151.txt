Patient was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2133-1-17**] secondary to c/o severe neck and back pain which he reports radiated up the back of his head while eating breakfast, he further stated that he experienced weakness, and a low heart rate.
Upon arrival to the ER his HR was in the 40's, SBP in the 70's, no syncope.
Also of note, patient experienced similar episode in [**2132-7-31**], although he reports the HA and neck pain during that episode was much worse, at that time he was admitted overnight and d/c'd the next day.
MI involving the anterior wall and cardiac apex, moderate dialation of the L ventricle, and mod area of ischemia within the cardiac septum.
On morning post-cath her returned from echo with urgency and 2 large bloody BM.

Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease.
The LAD had heavy calcifcation and diffuse disease.
There were serial 70-80% stenoses at D1 and D2.
Pressure wire interrogation of these lesions demonstrated a baseline FFR of 0.86, which decreased to 0.69 with maximal hyperemia on adenosine infusion.
These lesions were stented (see below).
There was mild disease in the diagonals, which were small.
The RCA had minimal luminal irregularities only and was a large, dominant vessel.
Cardiac Echo [**2133-1-22**] LVEF 20% The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include septal, anterior, and apical akinesis (septum is thinned and echodense consistent with scar).
No apical thrombus seen but cannot exclude; views are suboptimal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
EGD: Non bleeding healing duodeonal ulcers   Brief Hospital Course: Post cath: Patient had GI bleed and hypotension, Pt transferred to CCU for monitoring.
EGD showed non-bleeding doudenal ulcers.
On floor, pt had arthocentesis of knee that showed yellow fluid with crystals found to be gout.
[**1-24**] 8PM pt found to be acutely sob w/ HR in the 100-130's.
ECG showed atrial fibrillation.
While on heparin and coumadin his Hct remained stable and did not have any further GI bleeding.
Patient will need close follow up outpatient with doctor to make sure INR not supratheraputic and patient does not have reoccuring GI bleed.
## PNA - During hypoxic event at night patient spiked fever on [**1-25**].
Empirically started treating for pneumonia with levofloxacin - started [**1-26**] for 10 day course, therefore last day [**2133-2-1**].
Once patient GI bleed resolved started on beta-blocker and ACEI.
## CHF - Felt that patient respiratory failure due to fluid mobilization, especially after episode free s/p increasing nightly lasix and increasing afterload reduction.
Felt that tachycardia was secondary to respiratory distress and increased heart rate not contributing to nightly respiratory failure.
## Rhythm - Patient remained in chronic a.fib while in hospital.
Initially felt that patient's respiratory decompensation was due to rapid A.fib; and goal was to cardiovert patient in future.
However once discovered that respiratory hypoxia was more due to fluid shifts at night and CHF felt that patient did not need cardioversion since appropriately rate controlled; so amiodarone was stopped.
Continued anticoagulation with Coumadin and heparin bridge since patient in chronic atrial fibrillation.
## Gout - Patient had right knee tapped which came back positive for gout crystals.
While in hospital patient given steroid injection of knee for gout symptoms which he responded well to.
