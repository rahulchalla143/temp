The patient reported to [**Hospital3 6265**] on the day of admission with complaint of chest discomfort and shortness of breath.
The patient has a baseline expressive dysphagia, but was able to communicate the fact that he had chest pain, diaphoresis, dyspnea.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  The patient was alert, oriented, in no apparent distress.
He had some difficulties with verbal expression.
Neck: No lymphadenopathy appreciated on examination.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated on examination.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken for cardiac catheterization given his elevated troponins and history of chest pain and dyspnea.
The cardiac catheterization revealed moderately elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25.
Moderate diastolic dysfunction.
In addition, he was given 40 mg of IV Lasix for his elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
A chest x-ray was obtained which showed frank pulmonary edema.
The patient produced only moderate amounts of urine to the diuretic.
That night, the patient had additional episodes of respiratory distress.
Chest x-ray was again obtained which showed increased pulmonary edema.
This was thought to likely be secondary to ischemic cardiogenic shock.
The following day, these medications were weaned off and the patient was maintained on oxygen via nasal cannula and CPAP during his episodes of respiratory distress.
In the setting of worsening renal function the patient also became slightly acidotic with a pH of 7.27.
It was felt that the patient was becoming volume overloaded and would likely benefit from hemodialysis.
During this time, the patient had a large bowel movement and dropped his blood pressure with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s.
