Admission Date:  [**2144-9-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-9-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 552**] Chief Complaint: GI bleeding, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2145-9-23**] DART Chest tube insertion [**2144-9-25**] Colonoscopy   History of Present Illness: 89 year old female with a history of hemorrhagic stroke, seizure disorder, and recent fall with resultant pelvic fracture, hypertension, history of rectal prolapse and constipation who initially presented with acute blood loss anemia from lower GI bleeding.
The patient prior to hospitalization was at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab after her recent Pelvic fracture.
The patient at rehab experienced 1 episode of black stool followed by frank hematochezia which continued over next 24 hours including red clots.
The patient has never previously experienced GI bleeding and per PCP notes the patient underwent colonoscopy in [**2140**] which was normal.
However, the patient has been noted to have no additional bleeding and was additionally noted to have pneumothorax from CVL placement and tachycardia for which endoscopy was delayed.
[**Name (NI) 6**] Echocardiogram was obtained which was revealing for a hyperdynamic LVEF >75% and severe resting LVOT gradient and moderate to severe Mitral regurgitation.
The patient was seen by cardiology with impression LVOT was likely secondary to longstanding hypertension and now hypovolemia with recommendation to continue beta blockade, maintain normovolemia, and avoid medications that might dramatically lower preload or afterload.
Of additional note the patient experienced a complication of a right apical pneumothorax in setting of attempted IJ line placement in the ED.
The patient has subsequently had a DART chest tube placed by IR with subsequent near resolution of pneumothorax.
On arrival to the floor the patient reported only some mild discomfort over her right lower back and hip.
After patient transfer, [**Name (NI) 653**] by lab that 2 bottles from single set of blood cultures from the CVL placement had grown out gram positive cocci, which initially were treated with vancomycin, but ultimately were judged to be contaminant, given no fever and negative peripheral cultures.
On [**9-24**] she again experienced frank hematochezia, and so underwent repeat colonscopy on [**9-25**], during which they were unable to pass the scope beyond 35cm due to a stricture.
A CT Abdomen revealed a stricture, but no mass, so surgery was consulted, who felt no immediate need for surgery given lack of obstruction.
The patient and daughter repeatedly expressed no desire for major surgery.
Once she became conscious, she had significant difficulty producing language.
Hemorrhagic stroke in [**2142**] Seizure disorder   Her daughter was not sure about the manifestations of the seizures.
The patient was previously on Topamax 100mg [**Hospital1 **], but this was decreased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] due to concerns about drowsiness due to the Topamax Hypertension rectal prolapse hearing loss hip fracture hyponatremia   This was thought to be due to HCTZ which was discontinued.

Differential diagnosis includes the ischemic colitis and possible underlying malignancy.
Differential diagnosis includes ischemic colitis or malignancy.
Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to GI Bleeding - GI Consultation was obtained.
The stricture was confirmed on CT but no obvious mass seen - Patient had not had further bleeding x72 hours at time of discharge - Hematocrit has been stable at time of discharge - Given stricture in the sigmoid, we obtained a surgical consult, who concurred that watchful waiting is best given her high risk for surgery, and the lack of obstruction or other surgical lesions.
She does not have nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, or pain and her vital signs are stable.
Post Procedure Pneumothorax - Upon placement of RIJ in the ED, patient was found to have a pneumothorax on CXR, with subcutaneous emphysema.
Pelvic Fracture - Note non-healing acetabulum - Pain control with Tylenol 1 gm QID and Lidoderm Patch.
Only c/o pain with movement and declines stronger pain medicine.
Tachycardia - In the MICU, most likely MAT in setting of a pneumothorax and anemia - Resolved with variation in heart rate of 80 to 100 - continus metoprolol for rate control  6.
Bactremia - only 1 set of cultures were positive, which was presumed to be contamination  7.
Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy, MR - Preload Dependent - Cardiology was consulted who recommended continuing Metoprolol - Avoid reducing preload or afterload, maintain euvolemia, try to avoid diuretics, dehydration  8.
Hyponatremia - Pt has hx of hyponatremia, transiently improved w IVFs, Na at discharge 130, asymptomatic, monitor  9.
Benign Hypertension - metoprolol  10.
Pancreatic Mass - Incidentally found 8mm pancreatic mass.
Malnutrition and edema due to hypoalbuminemia - Diet and protein supplements - avoid diuretics if possible  CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI, confirmed w/daughter (HCP) ?????

Colonoscopy showed that there was a stricture in the sigmoid colon.
You also sustatined a pneumothorax, or collapsed lung, from central line placement.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection and completed a course of antibiotics for this.
You have a small nodule on your pancreas, which can be further examined by your primary care physician with an MRI.
