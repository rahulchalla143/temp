She has had colangitis in [**2171**] which was treated with biliary stenting x2 and removal of stone and sludge.
An abdominal ultra-sound showed intra and extra hepatic ductal dilitation with patent vasculature -- no acute process.
A CXR showed cardiomegaly and question of LLL atelectasis.
She was initially going to medicine but acutely became hypotensive and hypoxic (88/40 and 88% respectivly).
Durring the central line placement the patient became very short of breath.

There was severe post-obstructive dilation with the CBD measuring 20mm.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, with compressive atelectasis.
Extensive pneumobilia, with dilatation of the CBD and reflux of oral contrast, compatible with recent history of sphincterotomy/lithotripsy.

SIRS/SEPSIS secondary to cholangitis:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] presents with a picture concerning for SIRS/Sepsis in the setting of hypotension (SBPs in the 80s), tachycardia, and elevated white count.
Likely source of infection is in the biliary tree.
A RUQ ultrasound was done, which showed intrahepatic biliary dilatation, not significantly changed from prior.
Upon transfer to the floor, patient was afebrile with stable vitals.
# ELEVATED LFTs:   Complicated biliary history with multiple ERCP and stents, history of sphincterotomy and history of lap [**Doctor Last Name **].
On this admission, patient's elevated LFTs were consistent with a cholestatic picture; RUQ showed intrahepatic biliary dilatation though picture was not much changed from prior.
Patient had some post ERCP pain, which resolved on day one.
# Acute diastolic CHF/RESPIRATORY DISTRESS secondary to flash pulmonary edema:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was aggressively volume resuscitated in the ED with 4L of IVF; in the setting of so much fluid and moderate mitral stenosis, she developed flash pulmonary edema.
# HYPERTENSION, benign: Patient with history of hypertension.
In context of relative hypotension in the [**Name (NI) **], anti-hypertensives were held throughout ICU course.
# Hyperlipidemia - Statin was restarted on discharge .
# Mitral stenosis - Will need continued outpatient follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] .
# GERD - Continue PPI  # Osteoporosis - Ca/Vit D, Fosamax continued.
All other medical issues were stable and no medication changes were made.
