The patient had suffered renal failure due to Indocin toxicity and had been on hemodialysis for four years prior to transplant, using a left arm AV fistula.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2104**] and redo CABG in [**2110**].
Chronic renal insufficiency progressing to renal failure.
Status post corrective surgery for sleep apnea in [**2104**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.
The procedure was performed without complication and the patient thereafter transferred to the PACU for continued observation.
In the postoperative period, the patient also developed nausea and vomiting requiring placement of a nasogastric tube on postoperative day number four.
An abdominal x-ray revealed a dilated right colon.
CT scan of his abdomen was obtained to rule out mechanical obstruction prior to treatment with the Neostigmine.
Within a few seconds of the Neostigmine infusion, the patient became somnolent and with increasing respiratory distress.
The patient also went in to rapid atrial fibrillation with his heart rate in the upper 100s during this event.
Intra-operatively, the patient was noted to have gangrenous right colon with two small microperforations.
On [**4-6**], the patient remained on the amiodarone drip but continued to have recurrent atrial fibrillation.
On [**2112-4-7**], the patient was noted to have increased secretions and was also becoming tachypneic.
A chest x-ray revealed left lower lobe collapse.
On [**2112-4-8**], the patient required some increasing doses of Levophed.
On [**2112-4-8**], the patient also underwent CT scan of his abdomen to evaluate for obstruction.
There was no free air identified in the abdomen.
The transplanted kidney showed no evidence of hydronephrosis and there was no peri-renal fluid collection.
On [**2112-4-10**], a followup CT scan was obtained revealing an unchanged distribution of intraoperative peritoneal oral contrast.
There was no evidence of active contrast extravasation.
The patient was noted to have a right lower lobe consolidation.
While at CT scan, the patient did have an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation with a decrease in his systolic blood pressure to the 70s and 80s.
On [**2112-4-11**], the patient was noted to have a decreased cardiac output and an increased systemic vascular resistance and the patient was started on vasopressins in an attempt to support his cardiac output.
Note some concern for cardiac events.
The patient did have some episodes of atrial fibrillation and required cardioversions.
The patient also became febrile to 102.2 F.  The patient remained arousable to voice.
Because of worsening acidosis and decreasing cardiac output, the patient was also started on a Milrinone drip.
There was no evidence of purulence in the peritoneal cavity.
On [**2112-4-16**], cultures from the patient's midline abdominal wound which was open and was being packed came back with vancomycin resistant enterococcus.
While being turned in his bed on the night of [**2112-4-17**], the patient's right upper arm was noted to bend in a manner suggestive of a humerus fracture.
On [**2112-4-19**],  the patient was started on ciprofloxacin when cultures from his abdominal wound on the [**4-15**] grew pseudomonas.
On [**2112-4-20**], the patient had a decrease in his cardiac output.
Although the quality of the images obtained were poor, the study was able to verify that the patient had no pericardial effusion to explain the decreased cardiac output.
The patient's midline abdominal wound was debrided at the bedside on [**2112-4-21**], with no evidence of fasciitis noted.
DISPOSITION:  The patient's family was approached regarding the possibility of post mortem autopsy.
