Right lower lobe opacification and left hilar enlargement concering for neoplasm - recommend chest CT. 2 Mild cardiomegaly and mild central vascular congestion.
Chronic right hemidiaphragmatic elevation with bibasal atelectasis.
Glans penis, biopsy (A):  Spongiotic epidermal hyperplasia with confluent parakeratosis and neutrophilic exocytosis (see note).
No ulcer or herpes virus-type cytopathic changes are found in this sample.
He also had metabolic derangements including hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperphosphatemia in the setting of a stenosed AV fistula.
The patient had been off his coumadin for the past four days prior to admission with the intention of having a fistula revision.
Attempted rescue of the fistula with tPA met with no success.
The patient denied prodromal symptoms or abdominal discomfort, making viral syndrome (e.g.
His symptoms could have been [**3-2**] uremia, especially if recent dialysis had been ineffectual in setting of poor fistula function.
The bridge was continued >24 hours after being therapeutic on coumadin in the setting of known protein C deficiency.
The patient had a recent penile lesion for which he had presented to the ED several days prior and completed a five day course of Bactrim.
On routine CXR during the patient's ICU admission, he was found to have a RLL opacification which was felt to be worrisome for neoplasm with interval progression in comparison to a prior CXR.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: 1. nausea and vomiting 2. diarrhea 3. hypotension 4. bradycardia 5. skin lesion on penis  Secondary Diagnoses: 1. end-stage renal disease on dialysis 2. diabetes mellitus, type 2 3. atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
During your hospitalization, it was found that your fistula for dialysis had clotted.
We instead inserted a dialyis catheter in order to dialyze you without your fistula.
You were also found to have a slow heart rhythm during your admission.
You were seen by Dermatology during your admission for a lesion on your penis for which you had previously taken antibiotics.
You were also found to have a nodule on your lung on a chest X-ray while you were in the hospital.
