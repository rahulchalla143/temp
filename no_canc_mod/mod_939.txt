Studies- -Portable TTE ([**2200-3-25**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with inferior, septal, anterior and apical hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
-Portable TEE ([**2200-3-27**]) No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypo to akinesis of the anterior, septal, and inferior walls.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is a thin, mobile echodensity within the right ventricle which may represent a torn tricuspid chord and is much less concerning for a vegetation [clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]].
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No pathologic valvular regurgitation or vegetations.
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction as described above.
Subtle signal changes at the endplate of L4-5 and enhancement along the posterior margin of L4-5 disc as well as in the paraspinal region are suspicious for early changes of discitis.
There is no epidural abscess seen.
Small protrusion in the left neural foramen at L4-5 is identified, which could be also secondary to inflammatory changes.
Heterogeneous bone marrow could be related to marrow hyperplasia from anemia, but clinical correlation is also recommended to exclude marrow infiltrative process.
Severely increased left ventricular cavity size with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the left ventricular walls except for the lateral wall.
The LVEF was mildly decreased at 40%.
No CMR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
Severely increased left ventricular mass index with maximal basal anteroseptal wall thickness of 21 mm.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Trace mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonic regurgitation.
No significant tricuspid regurgitation.
Small pericardial effusion.
A note is made of bilateral pleural effusions, small-to-moderate on the left and small on the right.
Correlate with prior abdominal imaging if available.
[**4-1**] CXR: PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained on [**2200-3-31**].
There is a small-to-moderate amount of pleural effusion, most likely on the left, corresponding to the fluid seen on the MRI of the chest obtained on [**2200-3-31**].
Minimalm amount of pleural fluid seen on MRI on the right is most likely below the resolution of the chest radiograph.
# Ventricular fibrillation: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] following an OSH Vfib arrest while being treated for GBS meningitis.
It was felt that the most likely etiology of his arrythmia was LBB re-entrant tachycardia, though no arrythmia was induced while in the electrophysiology lab on [**2200-3-27**].
Overnight on [**2200-3-28**], the patient developed hemodynamically stable supraventricular tachycardia in the setting of acute urinary retention.
Suspected source was bacterial meningitis given results of a lumbar puncture.
ID was consulted and felt that there was no contraindication to ICD placement given that blood cultures had been negative for several days.
# Nonischemic Cardiomyopathy/Chronic systolic congestive heart failure.
The etiology of his cardiomyopathy remains unclear.
Given his depressed LVEF, Spironolactone should be considered as an otpatient.
The patient did have some orthostatic hypotension, that was felt secondary to deconditioning.
His hematocrit remained stable and there was no suggestion of acute blood loss.
And age-appropriate malignancy screening should be considered.
# Transaminitis:  Most likely secondary to hypotension (shock liver) during cardiac arrest.
# Hyperglycemia:  The patient did have some hyperglycemia early in the hospital course.
Hb A1c was 5.6% suggesting this was most likely secondary to his acute illness .
# Lower-back pain:  Ongoing since pre-hospitalization, possibly exacerbated by discitis, well-controlled with prn Oxycodone and Acetaminophen .
# Buttock ulcerations:  At home, the patient was treated with hot packs, and developed several ulcerations on his buttock.
================================== Transitional issues- -Consider Spironolactone initiation given depressed LVEF.
-Renal cyst noted on cardiac MRI, further work-up may be indicated -Monitor buttock ulcerations for improvement, consider work-up if more lesions develop  Medications on Admission: Home medications: - Lisinopril 5mg QD PO - Carvedilol 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **] PO - Simvastatin 20mg QD PO  Discharge Medications: 1. lisinopril 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Bacterial Meningitis (culture positive for Strep agalacticae) Ventricular Fibrillation Non-ischemic Cardiac Myopathy Hypertension Dyslipidemia Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You originally went to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**2200-3-19**] with a high fever and diagnosed with bacterial meningitis.
You were slowly getting better when you experienced an episode of cardiac arrest on [**2200-3-24**] due to an irregular heart rhythm called ventricular fibrilation.
You were stablized and then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2200-3-25**] for further management of this irregular heart rhythm.
The Carvedilol has been increased to 25mg twice a day and the Lisinopril was also increased to 10 mg once a day.
Please weigh yourself at the same time each morning and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if your weight increases by 3 pounds in one day or increases by 5 pounds in three days.
