The CT scan was also notable for an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, measuring 6.7 centimeters.
Of note, the etiology of her bleeding turned out to be hemorrhoids, not uterine.

[**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1290**] performed an endovascular repair of her thoracic aortic aneurysm.
Arteriography following stent placement revealed no endo leak at the proximal attachment site, with a small endo leak seen at the distal attachment site.
The operation was otherwise uneventful and there were no complications.
Subsequent CT scan showed a moderate amount retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Serial hematocrits remained stable and she transiently required pressors for hemodynamic support.
Over the next 24 hours, her hemodynamics improved and she successfully weaned from pressors without difficulty.
She was extubated without incident and the lumbar drain was removed without complication.
She had a transient decline in renal function with creatinine peaking to 1.8 but by discharge, her renal function improved.
