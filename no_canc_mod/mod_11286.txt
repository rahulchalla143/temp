HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of diabetes, status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair on [**8-28**], who began to experience chest pain at 10 p.m. on the night prior to his admission.
He felt this pain was similar to his gas pain from his surgery.
He denied shortness of breath or nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis at that time.
The pain occurred at rest and was not relieved by Tums and Tylenol.
At that time he electrocardiogram showed Q waves inferiorly with ST elevations.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] where he continued to have chest pain.
He was therefore taken urgently to the catheterization laboratory where he was found to have significant 3-vessel disease with a proximal total occlusion of the right coronary artery.
No balloon pump was placed secondary to his recent aortic graft, and he was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for monitoring.
Diabetes mellitus times one year, treated with oral hypoglycemics.
Peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history has no coronary artery disease.
In general, a sleepy man in no acute distress, post cardiac catheterization.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities were warm with no edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations in II, III, and F; normal sinus rhythm at 80, ST depressions in V1 and V2.
In summary, the catheterization showed a proximal 90% left anterior descending artery lesion, 60% proximal left circumflex lesion, and a total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery which received angioplasty and stent.
The patient was accepted and scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft; however, post catheterization, his creatinine bumped from 1.2 to 1.4, and therefore he was delayed pending the resolution of this creatinine bump.
On the morning of [**9-13**], the patient began to experience chest pain similar to that of his recent myocardial infarction.
An electrocardiogram was done, and he was found to have ST elevations.
Following this episode of pain, discussion revolved around whether or not to place an intra-aortic balloon pump; however, the fact that the pain had resolved, balloon pump was delayed and the patient was brought that morning to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times four.
At the time of transfer, the patient had an arterial line, a Swan-Ganz catheter, two ventricular and two atrial pacing wires, two mediastinal chest tubes, and a left pleural chest tube.
Of note, on exploration of the chest cavity, the patient was noted to have suffered a large right ventricular infarct prior to his surgery.
On postoperative day four, the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation.
In addition, the patient's creatinine had increased to 1.4, and he was noted to bilateral pleural effusions.
Because of his increasing creatinine and concern over his volume status, his PA line was reintroduced, and because of his pleural effusions bilateral chest tubes were placed.
However, he also remained in atrial fibrillation with a low cardiac output.
Every attempt to wean his dobutamine met with failure, and therefore he remained on dobutamine through postoperative day eight.
On postoperative day nine, the patient was again noted to have a low blood pressure with decreasing urine output and an increasing creatinine.
At that time the echocardiogram showed that the left ventricular size and systolic function were normal, that the right ventricle was dilated and hypokinetic, with moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and trace mitral regurgitation.
There was a moderate pericardial effusion noted at that time and no patent foramen ovale by color Doppler.
On postoperative day 11, the patient was again noted to have a large left pleural effusion that was tapped by Interventional Radiology for 1.5 liters of pleural fluid.
General examination revealed comfortable, in no acute distress.
Breath sounds with diffuse wheezes with scattered rhonchi.
Extremities were warm and well perfused with 2+ edema bilaterally.
Coronary artery disease, status post inferior myocardial infarction, status post right ventricular myocardial infarction; status post coronary artery bypass graft times four with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, a radial artery graft to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
Diabetes mellitus.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
