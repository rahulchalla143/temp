He is an 89 year old man with upper quadrant abdominal pain, starting at noon on the day of admission.
The pain was sharp and stabbing without radiation, without any aggravating or alleviating factors.
No nausea and vomiting, no fevers, no chills.
No urinary symptoms.
No reflux or metallic taste in the mouth.
The patient suffers from coronary artery disease.
Status post myocardial infarction.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Negative for tobacco.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient is an elderly male, in mild distress.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Tender in the upper quadrant, right greater than left.
Mildly distended.
Rectal:  No pain and no edema.
CTA showed no abdominal aortic aneurysm, no free air around the gastric antrum.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 89 year old man with coronary artery disease, hypertension, spinal stenosis.
He was doing well until the onset of upper abdominal pain at noon on the date of admission, without previous episodes.
Positive coronary artery disease with catheterization in [**11-20**] revealing occluded left anterior descending.
Abdomen was distended, tympanitic with upper abdominal tenderness and guarding.
CT scan was as mentioned before; thickened antrum, free air along the gastrohepatic ligament and extravasation of contrast.
The patient was to proceed urgently to the operating room for exploration or biopsy with ongoing resuscitation.
There was perioperative beta blockade and postoperative Intensive Care Unit care was planned.
Postoperatively, the patient's vital signs were stable but the patient was in atrial fibrillation without apparent atrial fibrillation complications.
On postoperative day number one, Surgical Intensive Care Unit day one, the patient had decreased Propofol and was allowed to waken.
The patient began running low grade fevers on postoperative day number five and six.
CT scan with contrast was done on that day, showing fluid with air anterior to the gastric fundus and adjacent to the body of the stomach and thickening at the gastric remnant.
This fluid with rim enhancement adjacent to the caudate lobe; small liver laceration, without evidence of obstruction at that time.
The patient began having some confusion without fevers and stable vital signs; however, he had increased work of breathing on [**2-20**], postoperative day number eight.
Neurology was consulted to evaluate this weakness and neurology noted that after the patient's emergent exploratory laparotomy for perforated duodenal ulcer, the patient's postoperative course had been relatively stable, although he had been in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and had been in sinus rhythm over the past three days prior to neurology's visit.
He did not notice any dysarthria, facial numbness, weakness or hemi-anesthesia.
He had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status over the past 72 hours prior to his neurology visit on [**2-23**] but was attributed to pain medication.
However, he became less alert and confused in the evening and it was thought to be sun downing.
Neurologic examination confirmed a left facial droop, almost flaccid left arm and upper motor neuron weakness in the left lower extremity.
There was also decreased sensation of temperature and light touch on the left arm and face.
The presentation was suspicious for stroke but many possible etiologies involving the face, arm and leg may indicate either occlusion of the right internal carotid artery, although there would be expected more signs, including field cut, neglect, etc.
; however, the most likely scenario is embolic etiology for pad or carotid effecting vasculature territories or M1 occlusion effecting subcortical descending like fibers.
Due to surgery, he was not a candidate for TPA but neurology noted that he would likely benefit from anticoagulation.
The patient had a Stat magnetic resonance scan done and on [**2154-2-24**], after normal head CT, magnetic resonance scan showed no evidence of stroke.
Repeat magnetic resonance scan two days later also showed no evidence of stroke.
Carotid ultrasound showed narrowing of less than 40%, bilateral internal carotid artery and TTE showing normal left atrium; normal left ventricle; apical left ventricular aneurysm; mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and focal akinesis of distal anterior and inferior walls; 1+ mitral regurgitation; mild thickening of atrioventricular valve and moderate PA; hypertension with an ejection fraction of 40%.
The patient's respiratory status was watched carefully for any evidence of pneumonia or pneumonitis and did not show any.
Infectious disease was consulted for increasing leukocytosis.
The patient had significant respiratory distress on [**2154-2-25**] and was transferred to the unit after having blood gas of 7.22, 86, 145, 37 and 4.
Two doses of Lasix were given on postoperative night of day 16 and the patient also had previous pulmonary consult which, as said before, recommended aggressive diuresis and possibly right upper extremity duplex and questionable use of Bi-pap to decrease work of breathing and aide in decreased PC02.
The patient's left sided weakness persisted.
On postoperative day number 18 and 19, the patient continued to have mild respiratory distress but was improving.
On postoperative day number 21, the patient was made DNR/DNI for decompensating respiratory and neurologic status.
The patient had bedside swallowing evaluation on [**2154-3-7**], after the patient was transferred to the floor on [**2154-3-5**], postoperative day number 21 and failed bedside swallowing evaluation.
Duodenal ulcer perforation.
[**Location (un) **] patch for duodenal ulceration perforation.
