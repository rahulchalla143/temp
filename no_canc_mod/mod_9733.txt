Admission Date:  [**2177-1-30**]       [**Year (4 digits) **] Date:  [**2177-3-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2120-9-27**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46 year old female with a history of polysubstance abuse who was transferred from [**Hospital 46148**] Hospital on [**2-17**] with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
The patient has a complicated recent medical history including an admission to [**Hospital 46148**] Hospital in [**2176-11-8**] following an overdose with multiple substances, subsequently developing bilateral question aspiration pneumonias requiring an Intensive Care Unit stay (it is not clear if the patient was intubated at this time).
The patient developed persistent hypoxemia after her [**Month (only) **] admission and was placed on 3 liters of nasal cannula oxygen upon [**Month (only) **] in [**Month (only) 1096**].
In this setting she presented to [**Hospital 46148**] Hospital on [**1-30**] with complaints of increasing shortness of breath.
She was begun on Ceftazidime and Clindamycin for possible aspiration pneumonia and also given steroids and nebulizers for compliance of reactive disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Her initial chest x-rays at the outside hospital revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates concerning for adult respiratory distress syndrome versus bilateral pneumonias due to severe aspiration.
The patient had increasing oxygen requirement and was eventually placed on nonrebreather on the medical floor.
The patient continued to require increasing positive end expiratory pressure and ventilatory supports by aggressive antibiotic therapy and Intensive Care Unit management.
The patient underwent a chest computerized tomography scan on [**2-11**] which revealed diffuse bilateral interstitial lung disease with subpleural bronchiectasis with a diffuse reticular nodular pattern.
The patient continued to require high forced inspiratory oxygen levels and positive end-expiratory pressure.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further evaluation management of her bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, question acute and chronic pulmonary disease of unclear etiology.
Question chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 3.
Question untreated obstructive sleep apnea; 4.
Question bipolar disorder versus depression with psychotic features; 6.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive tobacco use, patient lives with sister and has had a long history of polysubstance abuse including intravenous heroin, intranasal cocaine, alcohol and psychiatric medications.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Fennard Intensive Care Unit on [**2-17**] for further evaluation and management of her diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrate and persistent hypoxemia.
The patient's initial chest x-ray revealed left lower lobe collapse and consolidation with bibasilar ill-defined pulmonary infiltrate.
It is felt that the patient was in the later stages of adult respiratory distress syndrome.
Given that her open lung biopsy had revealed diffuse alveolar damage, consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary edema, the patient was placed on midury protocol for treatment of late stage adult respiratory distress syndrome with tapering dose of Solu-Medrol.
The patient continued, however, to have high ventilatory support requirement with positive end-expiratory pressure no less than 12.5 and FIO2 no less than 50%.
The patient continued to do well from all other perspectives without complications of other organ systems.
Her chest tube was removed on [**2177-2-19**] without complications.
A PICC line was placed on [**2177-3-3**] for improved intravenous access, given poor peripheral veins due to drug use.
A repeat chest computerized tomography scan was obtained on [**2177-3-4**] which revealed diffuse patchy areas of groundglass opacification and consolidation.
There was abnormal opacity of all areas of both lungs.
Consolidation has a dependent distribution and no endobronchial lesions are identified.
The computerized tomography scan was felt to be consistent with diffuse alveolar damage/pulmonary edema in a patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome.
It appears that this hospitalization was precipitated by an acute injury in the setting of chronic interstitial lung disease.
Whether the patient has interstitial pulmonary fibrosis is not clear.
It is clear that the patient has a long history of chemical dependence and overdoses with ?
development of chemical pneumonitis and repeat chemical versus infectious lung injury.
Placement of tracheostomy was without complications.
The patient continued to do well after tracheostomy placement and eventually had a percutaneous enterogastric jejunostomy tube placed on [**2177-2-2**] for nutritional support.
The procedure was without complications and tube feeds were started through her gastrostomy tube without complications.
Of note, the patient desaturates rapidly with excessive coughing and agitation.
It is clear that her substance abuse issues need to be addressed as an outpatient as well as her anxiety issues.
Of note, the patient had increasing secretions on [**3-6**] with mildly increased temperatures and mild leukocytosis to 15,000.
Given clinical scenario of increasing secretion and history of greater than 20 days on the ventilator, the patient was treated aggressively for ventilator associated pneumonia and responded well with double coverage of gram negative rods with Ceftazidime and Levofloxacin.
The patient's secretions decreased significantly and the patient has remained afebrile without leukocytosis since initiation of these antibiotics.
The patient will need follow up with pulmonary doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], as her diagnosis and prognosis remains unclear.
Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to question acute and chronic lung disease of unclear etiology.
Polysubstance abuse with history of multiple overdoses.
Question bipolar disorder versus depression with psychotic features.
Question obstructive sleep apnea untreated.
Question reactive airway disease versus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
8 hours prn constipation 12.
