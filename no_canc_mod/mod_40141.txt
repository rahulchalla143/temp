Given his history of COPD he was empirically treated with Vanc and Zosyn for a 7 day course and was started on IV methylprednisone.
He was extubated on HD5 without complication.
OSH CTs have subsequently noted interval enlargment of a lesion.
A bronchoscopy on this admission revealed a ball-valve type lesion, mobile with positive pressure and is thought to be causing obstruction leading to COPD exacerbations and pneumonias.
Per report, Mr. [**Known lastname 4281**] has been admitted at least five times this year for COPD exacerbations resulting in multiple intubations.

ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hypercarbic respiratory failure  - The patient was taken to the operating room for debulking procedure on the day after admission.
The patient was initially extubated in the operating but required reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
He denied SOB, DOE, Chest Pain, and then was transferred to the MICU to monitor for respiratory failure.
He was restarted on his home meds for COPD and CHF, including tiotropium, albuterol, ASA, diltiazem , metoprolol, Hydrochlorothiazide, and lasix.
He was transferred to the floor for continued monitoring and treatment of COPD (see below) .
# Bronchial mass - the bronchial mass was removed by rigid bronchoscopy and electrocautery by interventional pulmonology.
The mass was sent for pathologic examination and revealed endobronchial hamartoma.
The procedure was tolerated by the patient and without complication.
# Pulmonary Embolus, chronic - diagnosed on OSH CT approximately one month prior to this admission.
He was hostile toward staff, and a Code Purple was called.
INACTIVE ISSUES: # COPD with acute exacerbation - The patient was continued on his home medications during this hopsitalization.
As above, the patient did require reintubation for hypercapnic respiratory failure after his OR procedure.
# CHF - The patient presented with some edema likely due to volume overload from suboptimal diuresis versus IVF during ICU stay at this and recent hospitalizations.
# DM type 2- the patient's glyburide was held during the hospitalization and he was kept on SSI.
Disp:*20 injection* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: endobronchial removal of mass pulmonary embolism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr [**Known lastname 4281**]:  You were seen in the [**Hospital1 18**] for your endobronchial mass resection.
