No postictal confusion, no incontinence or tongue biting.
There were many people around; no reported tonic-clonic activity.
During prior seizures she was observed to have GTC activity, aura, post ictal confusion, +/- urinary incontinence.
She does have a history of atrial tachycardia to 160's during prior admission, asymptomatic.
In [**Name (NI) **] pt found to have subdural hematoma and admitted to neurosurgery.
Transferred to medicine for workup of her syncope.

Healing skin tear at hairline of L forehead, no active bleeding.
No oral trauma.
S1 S2, 2/6 systolic murmur at LLSB.
Tympanic throughout, no shifting dullness.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Mixed density in the adjacent subdural space may represent hyperacute-on-acute bleeding or acute-on-chronic bleeding.
Superficial soft tissue swelling along the left frontal region.
There is local mass effect, without shift of normally midline structures.
CT head (repeat [**10-5**]) Stable right-sided subdural hematoma .
CXR: No displaced rib fracture or acute cardiopulmonary process.
Left axis deviation with left anterior fascicular block.
Multilevel degenerative changes are present in the facet joints.
No acute fracture or dislocation is identified.
Echo ([**2142-4-6**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Review of telemetry: No Vtach.
Frequent PVCs, no couplets, at times trigeminy or every fourth beat is PVC.
Brief Hospital Course: A&P: Ms. [**Known lastname 24214**] is a 79 F with h/o seizure disorder on Dilantin, multiple PVCs on telemetry, h/o atrial tachycardia; initial admit to neurosurgery with subdural hematoma (now stable); transfer to medicine for syncope workup.
# Syncope: Pt's fall and LOC seemed most consistent with syncope (vs. seizure).
Although she had h/o seizure disorder, this episode was not c/w priors.
No prodrome, no postictal confusion, no incontinence/tongue biting.
Echo was unchanged from previous (normal EF, no aortic stenosis).
She had frequent PVCs here (frequently in trigeminy) but no NSVT or couplets.
EP was consulted and saw no evidence of syncope due to arrhythmia.
No known toxins/electrolyte abnormalities.
She also had some unsteadiness on her feet (unclear how much of this was due to the SDH) with occasional falls at home.
It was also quite likely that she had a mechanical fall with head trauma severe enough to cause mild retrograde amnesia.
She had serial CT scans to evaluate progression and the hemorrhage continued to show stability/improvement.
There was no neurologic deficits.
# Seizure disorder.
She had had no seizure x 20 years but has continued on dilantin mainly because she has felt uncomfortable off antiepileptics.
# Osteopenia: contined Fosamax.
# Anemia: Normocytic, near baseline and stable.
# Hyperlipidemia: continued atorvastatin  Medications on Admission: Dilantin 300 mg QAM, 400 mg QPM Fosamax 35 mg Qweek Lipitor 10 mg QHS   Discharge Medications: 1.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Subdural hematoma Syncope Seizure disorder   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for an episode of falling with a related head injury.
There was a small amount of bleeding inside your head (subdural hematoma) that has not changed while we have been monitoring you.
Please return to the hospital if you have further episodes of fainting, seizure, dizziness, palpitations, difficulty with memory or confusion, or any new symptoms that you are concerned about.
