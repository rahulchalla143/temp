He was intubated en route from an outside hospital after he began to complain of difficulty breathing.
Upon arrival, a CT scan revealed fractures of C1, C2, C3, and C4 with significant cord compromise.
HEENT: PERRL 4-->2mm bilaterally, small laceration to forehead.
EXT: No gross deformities.
No spontaneous movement.
NO RECTAL TONE.
No acute fractures or dislocations are identified.
Fracture traversing through the large anterior osteophytes at the C2-C3 level and extending into the body of C2 with severe lordotic angulation and high grade narrowing of spinal canal.
-------  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70287**] CONCLUSION: No acute intracranial abnormalities.
-------  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 70288**] IMPRESSION: 1) No CT findings suggestive of acute traumatic injury throughout the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
2) Bibasilar consolidation most likely consistent with aspiration.
3) Fatty infiltration of the liver.
Significant cord compression at C3-4 level with cord edema versus contusion.
This is most likely due to disc protrusion at this level.
Anterior and posterior longitudinal ligamentous injury along with prevertebral hematoma in the upper cervical spine.
