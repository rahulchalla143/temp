History of Present Illness: Patient is an 83yo caucasian male with history of CAD s/p CABG x 6 in [**2114**], and known symptomatic aortic stenosis.
He reports worsening shortness of breath over the last 2 years.
He was referred for screening for Corevalve/TAVI 8 months ago and was excluded due to large annular size.
Since prior visit, patient reports decreased exercise tolerance with ability to walk less that half a block with out stopping due to shortness of breath.
He admits to frequent episodes of lightheadedness and dizziness though this is also in the setting of baseline vertigo disease.
It has been determined that he would likely need a permanent pacemaker if having either surgical AVR or TAVI.
Three vessel coronary artery disease with 100% occlusion of the SVG to the RCA with prominent left to right collaterals to the PDA, Patent sequential SVG to the proximal LAD and mid LAD; Patent LIMA to the diagonal branch; Patent graft to OMB1 (that provides collaterals to the PDA).
The only area of potential ischemia in the inferior wall is supplied by collaterals from the LCA.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM  TTE (Complete) Done [**2123-3-10**] at 11:00:00 Echocardiographic Measurements   Findings LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Dilated RV cavity.
AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.7 cm2).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined with certainty or precision (due to the absence of a reliable tricuspid regurgitation Doppler spectrum) but appears to be at least moderately elevated.
There is no pericardial effusion.
This is most likely the result of technical factors (LVOT diameter measurement was 0.1 cm larger on prior study, and LVOT flow velocity was 0.2 m/sec higher on prior study) rather than a major change in the aortic valve itself.

Extensive interstitial changes are noted throughout the lungs, with subpleural predominance as well as apical-basal gradient, consistent most likely with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia.
No focal consolidation worrisome for infection or neoplasm is noted.
Main pulmonary artery is dilated up to 3.8 cm, right main pulmonary artery is 2.8 cm and left main pulmonary artery is 2.7 cm, findings consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
Questionable gallstones are noted, but no evidence of cholecystitis is present.
No bowel wall thickening or bowel wall dilatation is present.
There is no intraperitoneal air or fluid.
No lymphadenopathy is seen.
CT PELVIS: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid with no evidence of diverticulitis is present.
No lymphadenopathy, free fluid, or air is noted.
Extensive degenerative changes are present in the imaged portion of the skeleton, but no lytic or sclerotic lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm demonstrated.
CTA:   AORTA: No pathologic aortic dilatation is noted throughout the entire aorta.
Mild tortuosity of the abdominal aorta is present.
Extensive calcifications at the origin of the SMA are noted with potentially substantial narrowing.
Renal arteries are calcified at their origins but no substantial narrowing is present.
Aorta bifurcates unremarkably.
Minimal focal dissection/mural thrombus at the proximal portion of the common iliac artery is present, 7:180.
The aortic valve is calcified, consistent with known aortic stenosis.
Right bypass is occluded with aneurysmatic dilatation at the mid portion.
Evidence of interstitial lung fibrosis, consistent with nonspecific interstitial lung disease.
No evidence of aneurysmatic dilatation of the aorta.
Pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: 83yo caucasian male who got a Corevalve for severe symptomatic aortic stensois, and a PPM for second degree heart block.
Symptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis: on dc pt is POD#6 Corevalve/TAVI.
The first valve popped out, placed 2nd valve, and had 1+ perivalvular leak after procedure.
Arrythmia: pt had second degree heart block and was POD 10 s/p placement of [**Company 1543**] Adapta PM.
No events occurred and the pt remained stable.
diabetes: We managed with insulin s/s  # obstructive sleep apnea: pt used CPAP mask at night  # anemia: Pt remained hemodynamically stable, incisions sites were clean and dry and there were no signs of active bleeding.

Aortic stenosis - POD#6 s/p Corevalve/TAVI 2. diastolic heart failure 3.
CAD s/p CAGB x 6 (SVG to the PDA is occluded, all other grafts patent) 5.
HTN 7.
Diabetes 8.
Obstructive Sleep apnea (uses CPap machine at night) 9.
You were admitted for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis for which you were extremely short of breath with increasing fatigue, diastolic heart failure for which you were retaining fluid, and an irregular heart rythm of second degree heart block which put you at risk for progressing to a more dangerous heart rythm.
For your severe symptomatic aortic stenosis you had a transcatheter percutaneous aortic valve replacement with a Corevalve 31mm device.
You did not have any major post procedure complications.
