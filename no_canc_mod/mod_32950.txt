Admission Date:  [**2141-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-4-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-6-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**] Chief Complaint: Acute pancreatitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation at an outside hospital ERCP with sphincterotomy   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 44 year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, who presents with severe epigastric pain.
The patient was in her usual state of good health until 3pm on the day of admission ([**4-9**]), when she developed rapid-onset sweating and [**9-21**] constant (non-fluctuating) epigastric pain that radiated to her back.
Coincident with the onset of pain, she reports new-onset nausea, with 1 episode of non-bloody vomiting.
She denies previous episodes of abdominal pain, history of hyperlipidemia, history of discolored urine, recent flu-like illness, or abdominal trauma.
MRCP was obtained, showing no ductal dilation and no gallstones.
The patient developed fever, change in mental status, hypoxia, and tachypnea leading to intubation, which was complicated by aspiration during the intubation procedure (ABG post-intubation on 400/12/5 was 7.39/34/102).
Aspiration from OG tube revealed coffee-ground emesis after intubation.
ROS: 1 month prior to presentation, patient reports diffuse rash on the torso (sparing arms/legs) composed of 1 mm red, intensely itchy papules.
Patient reports new bluriness of vision within the past 2 weeks, which is partially corrected by corrective lenses.
's father "died of alcoholism") Patient's 2 brothers: alcoholism  Physical Exam: VITALS: T 100.7, BP 120/70, HR 80, RR 16, Sat 93% (RA) General: Patient is comfortable and conversational, nontoxic, in no apparent distress.
Mild confusion in fact finding/verbal response.
Few [**3-17**] small skin-colored 1mm papules on left side of abdomen.
Trachea midline.
Positive egophony noted bilaterally, with transition at the levels of diminished breath sounds (described above).
Lymphatic: No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Moderate distention.
Moderate tenderness to palpation in mid-epigastrum.
No organomegaly.
Technically limited abdominal radiograph demonstrates prominent gaseous loops of bowel in mid-abdomen.
[**2141-4-12**] CXR - IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Examination marked semi-upright has an appearance suggesting essentially supine positioning, and moderate right and moderate to large left pleural effusion, responsible for left lower lobe atelectasis.
Reduced effusions are seen bilaterally.
Some left basilar atelectasis is seen, but there is no patchy consolidation.
IMPRESSION: Improving but persistent effusions.
Mildly distended gallbladder without evidence of gallstones.
No definite son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Edematous heterogeneous pancreas.
A focus of high attenuation seen on the outside hospital CT near the ampulla of Vater is not imaged on the current ultrasound, likely related to differences in modality.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 44 year old female with hypothyroidism and frequent alcohol use who was transfered from an outside hospital with acute pancreatitis and respiratory failure.
# Acute pancreatitis: The patient's lipase and abominal pain initially improved, however, she continued to have mild epigastric abdominal pain and her lipase started to trend upward on hospital day 5.
Per the recommendation of the general surgery team that was following, GI was consulted for consideration of ERCP vs. further imaging given that OSH imaging showed necrosis in the pancreatic tail, a pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas (near the SMA), and a non-obstructing stone in the ampulla of vater.
The patient was taken for ERCP, spincterotomy was performed, and several stones and biliary sludge were removed.
The patient's abdominal pain improved and her lipase subsequently began to trend downward again.
Reviewing her OSH images, it appears that she had a LLL effusion, likely secondary to pancreatitis, prior to intubation, and then developed a right-sided consolidation post-intubation, likely from aspiration of vomitus.
# ETOH abuse:  The patient was extensively counselled by the medical team as well as social work regarding the contribution of alcohol consumption to pancreatitis and to help her strategize to identify ways to maintain sobriety on discharge.
Tablet(s)   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Acute pancreatitis Pulmonary effusion Aspiration Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnosis: Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable, afebrile, minimal abdominal pain.
Discharge Instructions: You came to [**Hospital1 **] with severe upper abdominal pain, and breathing problems.
[**Name (NI) **] tests and CT imaging showed that you had acute pancreatitis, causing pain in the abdomen.
A pulmonary effusion (fluid in the lung) and aspiration pneumonia was the cause of your breathing difficulties.
You have phelbitis in your right arm from the IVs.
The swelling and pain should resolve with time.
Call your physician or return to the hospital if you have new pain in the upper abdomen, or if you have nausea/vomiting, severe diarrhea, dizzyness, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, high fevers, or any other concerning symptoms.
Please call The general surgery department at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4336**] to obtain specific details regarding time, place, and planning for the surgery, and to ask any further questions.
