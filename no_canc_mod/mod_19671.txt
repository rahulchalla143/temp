The pregnancy was notable for in [**Last Name (un) 5153**] fertilization, di-chorionic, di- amniotic twin gestation and was unremarkable until the mother presented with upper respiratory infection  symptoms, proteinuria and elevated uric acid consistent with pre- eclampsia.
Given advanced gestational age and severity of symptoms of pre-eclampsia, the babies were delivered.
Cesarean section was performed and twin B had moderate tone and good cry with Apgar scores of 7 and 9 receiving brief blow-by oxygen.
The patient had symptoms of respiratory distress and was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for further evaluation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory: No surfactant or ventilation necessary.
No history of hypotension.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: The patient was initially on intravenous fluids of D10W and increased enteral feeds rapidly to full feeds on day of life 4.
Since that time, he has increased kilocalories.
A second rebound was obtained for concern that the patient's color was still mildly jaundiced.
Additional repeat obtained on [**2161-11-7**], on day of life 14, showed a total bilirubin of 7.7, still well below limit for initiation concern to the point of reinitiating phototherapy.
Although the patient had a mildly high bilirubin on day of life 3, he has been able to maintain acceptable levels for 1 week off phototherapy.
Prophylactic antibiotics not given at birth given delivery due to maternal indications and no significant distress on course of infant.
The patient at this time is still taking approximately 140 cc/kg/day on top of breast feeding.
