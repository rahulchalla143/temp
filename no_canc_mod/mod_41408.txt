History of Present Illness: This is a 39-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, who presented to an outside hospital 3 weeks ago with ischemic small bowel.
He was found to have an occluded SMA and SMV.
He underwent an ileal resection and was recovering when he developed severe back pain and presented to the outside hospital emergency room.
There, a CT of the chest and abdomen demonstrated an ascending aortic dissection and was subsequently transferred here for further management.
Therefore, we brought him up to the operating room, where under MAC he had a transesophageal echocardiogram performed and this demonstrated that there was a mass and not a dissection.

Pertinent Results: TTE [**2102-9-9**] No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There is a complex (mobile) mass in the ascending aorta that is large and freely mobile with a wide base narrow stalk and larger mass extending off the stalk.
The mass seems to wave to within 5 cm of the aortic valve, but seems to be attached in the arch.
No evidence of dissection.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Focal thrombus within the right basilic vein at the level of the antecubital fossa.
No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
Echogenic focus in the right internal jugular vein, possibly represent a valve, fibrin deposit, or old retracted clot.
However, no evidence of acute DVT.
No subcutaneous fluid collection concerning for abscess.
CLINICAL INDICATION:  39-year-old man with persistent headaches, history of thrombosis, admitted with supratherapeutic INR, evaluate for emboli - bleed.
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute or subacute intracranial hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, or shifting of the normally midline structures.
IMPRESSION:  There is no evidence of acute intracranial process.
TORSO CT [**2102-9-9**] INDICATION:  39 yo M with Crohn's disease and is s/p ileal resection for ischemic bowel on [**2102-8-15**], found to have thrombus in the SMA and SMV at that time.
Severe back pain this AM and presented to the ED at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.
A CTA of the abdomen revealed an irregular dissection in the medial aspect of the ascending aorta.
FINDINGS: CTA OF THE CHEST: There is a focal type A dissection of the mid ascending aorta with a small intramural hematoma and associated intraluminal thrombosis abutting the dissection flap.
No extension of the dissection into the aortic arch, supra-aortic vessels or coronary arteries.
No hemopericardium, and no hemothorax.
There is no focal lung consolidation and no pneumothorax or suspicious pulmonary nodules.
There are no focal hepatic lesions.
The gallbladder shows a combination of stones and vicarious secretion (from OSH CT).
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
There is a small bowel anastomosis site in the mid lower abdomen and pelvis with fat infiltration of the wall in the terminal ileum and cecum, likely due to chronic Crohn's disease.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
A midline laparotomy incision is seen.
There is atherosclerotic plaque and calcification of the left external iliac artery and CFA.
BONES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
Sacroiliac joint sclerotic changes are demonstrated.
Focal type A dissection of the mid ascending aorta with a small intramural hematoma and associated intraluminal thrombus abutting the dissection flap.
No extension of the dissection into the aortic arch, supra-aortic vessels or coronary arteries.
No hemopericardium, and no hemothorax.
Occlusion of the distal SMA and particular the right sided branches.
Pathology Aorta, mass: Aortic segment with infarction/ischemia associated with an organizing thrombus.
Gross:   The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, "[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]", the medical record number and "aortic wall mass pathology."
It consists of a fragment of aortic wall measuring 3 cm x 1.9 cm x 0.6 cm in thickness with a fungating adherent mass measuring 0.8 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm.
The cut mass comes to within 0.2 cm of the cut edge.
Additionally submitted in the same container are two fragments of also unoriented aortic wall measuring 3.5 x 1 x .3 cm and 3 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm.
The specimen is submitted as follows: A-B = mass entirely submitted, C = representative adjacent normal aorta (edges inked blue) and representative sections from close additional pieces of aortic wall (uninked).
They believed the previous SMA thrombus may have been an embolic phenomenon and if there is an aortic mass that alone could have developed a thrombus which them embolized.
Pathology revealed Aortic segment with infarction/ischemia associated with an organizing thrombus.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
INR remained elevated therefore the epicardial pacing wire was cut.
Free water restriction was implemented for hyponatremia which resolved.
Infectious disease team was consulted with persistent fevers.
He was pancultured and started on Bactrim DS for coag + staph aureus in his urine culture (started [**9-14**]).
By the time of discharge on POD6 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
