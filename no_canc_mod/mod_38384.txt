At the [**Hospital3 **] ED, he was found to have persistent tonic-clonic seizures.
He was intubated for airway protection in light of his mental status, was given 1gm of dilantin and 6mg of ativan as well as 2L IV NS.
He was also found to have a leukocytosis to 17.6.
Urine was negative for ketones, and glucose elevated at 338.
In the ED, He was seen by neurology who felt his seizures were secondary to poorly controlled DM and recommended admission to the MICU.

Left infrahilar consolidation could be pneumonia or atelectasis and should be followed.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
MRI Head (preliminary read):  No acute intracranial abnormality.
No abnormality identified on the MRI to explain the patient's seizures.
Renal Ultrasound: The right kidney measures 12.1 cm, the left kidney measures 10.6 cm without evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or masses.
CT sinus/mandible: FINDINGS: There is anterior dislocation of the right mandibular condyle and anterior subluxation of the left mandibular condyle, which appears partially reduced compared to yesterday's outside hospital head CT.
There is no evidence of fracture.
Aerosolized secretions are seen in the left frontal sinus and left ethmoid air cells.
Mucosal thickening is seen in the ethmoid air cells bilaterally and maxillary sinuses bilaterally.
Air-fluid levels and mucosal thickening are seen in the sphenoid sinuses bilaterally.
This study is not optimized for evaluation of intracranial structures; within this limitation, no large abnormalities are detected.
Anterior dislocation of the right mandibular condyle and anterior subluxation of the left mandibular condyle without evidence for acute fracture.
Aerosolized secretions in the left frontal sinus and left ethmoid air cells with air-fluid levels in the sphenoid sinuses bilaterally, which are likely secondary to retained secretions from recent intubation.
Soft tissue thickening of the uvula and posterior pharynx, which likely represents edema secondary to recent intubation.
EEG: No evidence of seizure activity.
Focal slowing consistent with toxic metabolic syndrome.

# Status Epilepticus: Presumed secondary to electrolyte disturbances secondary to DKA/HHS decreasing the patient's seizure threshold.
There was no clear source of infection and the patient was without localizing symptoms; infection was not thought to explain the patient's symptoms, and no lumbar puncture was done.
Brain MRI was done which showed no structural abnormality of the brain to explain seizures.
Patient had no further seizure activity while hospitalized.
# Altered Mental Status:  Patient was admitted intubated and sedated.
Patient received teaching regarding the importance of compliance and careful control of his blood sugars.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Patient admitted with serum creatinine 1.4 which increased to 3.1.
Acute kidney injury was thought to be multifactorial related to poor oral intake and rhabdomyolysis in the setting of tonic-clonic seizures.
However, the Cr slowly rose and then slowly improved, suggesting possible ATN, although there is no prolonged hypotension documented, and he never required pressors.
Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis.
# Mild Thrombocytopenia: Etiology is unclear but may be related to critical illness.
Of note, thrombocytopenia developed prior to heparin administration so is unlikely secondary to HIT.
Patient without evidence of DIC on labs.
TTP/HUS in the setting of renal failure was ruled out.
# Anemia: Previously diagnosed with B12 deficiency though baseline was unknown.
Iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
Anemia remains stable through admission with H/H 11.0/32.4.
It is unclear why this apparently healthy host would have anemia of chronic disease.
# Fever and leukocytosis: Afebrile since admission to the floor.
Patient had fever to 100.2 at midnight on [**2144-11-22**].
Likely secondary to seizures, but differential also includes infectious etiology such as pneumonia (given possible RUL infiltrate on CXR with poor inspiration).
However, his respiratory status markedly improved and he his on RA, and there was no indication for further work-up.
Leukocytosis was thought to be secondary to stress response from seizure and DKA/HHS.
# Jaw dislocation: Likely occurred during intubation.
There is no fracture see on CT of the mandible.
No acute intervention was warranted.
# rule out ACS: Given acute neurologic event, cardiac risk factors, and diffuse ST elevations on EKG there was concern for ACS.
Troponins were negative times three during this admission, so no further action was taken, especially in absence of chest pain.
# OSA: He carries a diagnosis of OSA but is not compliant with CPAP.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Tonic-clonic seizures  Secondary diagnosis: Rhabdomyolysis Acute kidney injury Insulin dependent diabetes Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We believe the cause of your seizures was due to electrolyte imbalance influenced by your underlying diabetes.
An MRI of your head was done to determine if there was a brain abnormality that was causing your seizures, but no abnormality was identified.
However, you do have follow-up with neurology for a routine EEG as an outpatient (once discharged from the hospital).
