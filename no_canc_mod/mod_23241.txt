A CT head showed a large left parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with Intraventricular extension and rightward midline shift.
A neurosurgical consultation was obtained, and felt that her chances for meaningful recovery were very unlikely.
Also incidentally noted on laboratory data was a leukocytosis to 18,000 with 23% bands, a CK elevation to 2709 (with normal renal function), and a UA with hematuria only.
A CXR was noted to have bilateral apical opacities concerning for aspiration.

Intraparenchymal bleed: Unfortunately complicated by hydrocephalus and right sided midline shift.
Per neurosurgery, "likely zero" chance for meaningful recovery.
No neurosurgical or medical interventions available at this time.
During the course of her hospitalization she developed signs of cerebral herniation and developed PEA arrest.
Leukocytosis: Urinalysis is unremarkable for infection, CXR concerning for aspiration PNA.
She was stated emprically for aspiration PNA with zosyn .
