Admission Date:  [**2119-4-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2119-5-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2044-6-2**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft with ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 10 to 15%, diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease, transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for Swan-Ganz placement and hemodynamic monitoring on [**2119-4-27**].
The patient was initially admitted to the hospital on [**2119-4-9**] as a transfer from an outside hospital for evaluation of left foot ulcer as well as decompensated congestive heart failure.
Use of his ACE inhibitor was limited secondary to low blood pressure.
On [**4-14**], the patient had an episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia which was terminated by deployment of AICD.
The patient has had multiple episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia since that time and has been followed by the Electrophysiology Service.
Milrinone was temporarily discontinued for his ventricular tachycardia.
While in the Cardiac Care Unit, the patient was noted to have depressed cardiac index and a low to normal SVR as well as elevated biventricular filling pressures suggesting decompensated congestive heart failure of cardiogenic origin.
The ability to increase the Milrinone was limited by hypotension as well as ventricular arrhythmias.
On [**2119-5-1**], the patient had repeat deployment of his AICD resulting in briefly a hypotension and unresponsiveness.
The patient subsequently recovered hemodynamically although his mental status remained slightly altered.
Over the next several days, the patient became progressively more hypotensive despite withdrawal of his Carvedilol, limiting of his diuresis and decreased dose of his Milrinone.
He also had progressive oliguric renal failure, suggesting poor renal perfusion.
He was noted to become increasingly dyspneic, with worsening congestive heart failure.
Several family meetings were held over the course of the final week of his life to discuss code status and withdrawal of care and emphasis on comfort.
