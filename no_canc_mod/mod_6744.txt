Admission Date:  [**2103-10-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-10-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2042-6-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain, Transfer from [**Hospital3 3583**]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coronary artery bypass graft ( LIMA-LAD, SVG -diagonal, Obtuse marginal, diagnonal RCA)   History of Present Illness: 61M with PMH of CAD s/p AMI in [**2094**], multiple PCI, HLP, HTN, [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] where he presented with chest pain.
Not associated with SOB, diaphoresis or nausea.
He and his wife left to go to the hospital, but the pain continued so they stopped at a local fire station where he received 2 SLNG and an ASA and was brought to [**Hospital3 3583**].
There his EKG showed slight STD in 1 and AVL.
He was chest pain free by the time he arrived at [**Hospital1 46**].
In the ED here, VSS, was chest pain free.
Upon transfer to the floor, patient is still chest pain free.
Denies any current CP, SOB, N/V/D, HA or vision changes.
Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with patent but mildly disease LMCA.
The LAD had moderate diffused disesae proximally and was totally occluded within the old [**Doctor First Name 10788**] stent.
LCX had mild diffuse disease and the RCA stent had only mild ISR but were otherwise patent.
Successful placement of two overlapping Cypher drug-eluting stents (2.5 x 28 mm distally and 3.0 x 18 mm proximally) in the proximal to mid-LAD to treat in-stent restenosis and a total occlusion.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: HTN Hyperlipidemia DM - on po meds Obesity   Social History: He is married with three children, currently not working (worked previously as a [**Doctor Last Name 9808**] operator) - supposed to start again on Tuesday.
Family History: Mother died at 59 of an myocardial infarction.
Brother, question of an myocardial infarction at age 45.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with no JVD CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel CAD.
The LAD had a 90% stenosis proximal to the prior series of stents, and was occluded in the mid portion of the stent.
The distal LAD fills by faint left to left collaterals with an apparently good caliber vessel.
The LCX had progression of disease up to 70% in the proximal vessel.
The RCA had a tight 90% in stent restenosis within the proximal vessel.
The remaining RCA was of large caliber.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mild systemic arterial hypertension with BP of 142/80mmHg.
LVEDP was modestly elevated at 25mmHg.
There was no gradient on pullback of catheter from LV to aorta.
Left ventriculography demonstrated anterolateral and apical hypokinesis with preserved wall motion of the basal segments.
There was no mitral regurgitation.
Systemic arterial hypertension.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls.
The apex is mildly aneurysmal and hypokinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution).
There is an element of varicose dilatation involving the right greater saphenous vein.
Q waves in the inferior leads consistent with prior infarction.
Late transition with tiny R waves in the anterior leads consistent with possible prior anterior wall myocardial infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing possible anterior wall myocardial infarction is new.
