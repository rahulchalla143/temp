INDICATION: 46-year-old man with history of subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been further evolution of large right MCA stroke with a well-defined hypoattenuating area indicating edema and progressive encephalomalacia.
There is mild ex vacuo dilatation of the right lateral ventricle.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage identified.
No midline shift or evidence of subfalcine or uncal herniation.
There is trace residual high attenuation along the skull vertex consistent with mild residual subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Aneurysmal clips in the bilateral supraclinoid ICA are noted limiting adequate evaluation of this area.
Air-fluid level and aerosolized secretions within the left maxillary sinus and left frontal sinus as well as opacification of the mastoid air cells were seen on the prior exam and likely relate to the patient's previous intubated status.
Continued evolution of right MCA infarct.

Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 46 year old man with recent SAH now w/ R MCA stroke REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please perform CT PERFUSION study in addition to CTA.
INDICATION: 46-year-old male patient, with recent subarachnoid hemorrhage, now with right MCA stroke, to perform CT perfusion.
PRELIMINARY REPORT: CTA is markedly limited in the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] secondary to metallic artifact.
FINDINGS:  NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD:  As seen on the most recent noncontrast CT, there is a large hypodense area in the right cerebral hemisphere in the MCA territory, representing acute infarction.
There is unchanged appearance of the small hypodense foci, representing continued evolution of the multiple bilateral previously noted watershed infarcts, particularly prominent in the bilateral frontal lobes, right greater than left.
Small areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage noted in the vertex, as before, unchanged.
CT PERFUSION:  There is increased mean transit time, corresponding to the area of hypodensity in the right cerebral hemisphere with decreased blood flow and slightly decreased blood volume, compared to the left cerebral hemisphere, with no mismatch between the areas of decreased blood flow and blood volume, and hence, representing acute infarction.
The common carotid, cervical internal carotid and intracranial internal carotid arteries are patent, except for the supraclinoid segments, which are not adequately evaluated due to artifacts from the aneurysm clips.
Multiple lymph nodes are noted in both sides of the neck, the largest in the right level 1B, measuring 1.0 cm, and not enlarged by CT size criteria.
Moderate opacification is noted in the left maxillary sinus, left side of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses, and mild in the mastoid air cells on both sides, representing fluid or mucosal thickening.
Degenerative changes are noted in the cervical spine, not adequately evaluated on the present study.

Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2101-3-15**]    OBJECT: HISTORY OF SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE, ANEURYSM COILING, RULE OUT SEIZURES.
REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]   FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording, the background was disorganized and consisted of low voltage fast activity admixed with excessive theta and delta frequencies.
The background was interrupted by brief bursts of moderate amplitude generalized mixed theta and delta frequency slowing.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing.
There were no epileptiform features.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an average rate of 78 beats per minute but with frequent ectopic beats.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the disorganized and low voltage fast background activity admixed with excessive theta and delta frequencies and interrupted by brief bursts of moderate amplitude generalized mixed theta and delta frequency slowing.
These findings are consisent with a moderate global encephalopathy and suggest dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the common causes of encephalopathy but there are others.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, although encephalopathic patterns can sometimes obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features.
No electrographic seizure activity was noted.
