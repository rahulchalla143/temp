Pt had L UE AV fistula banded for vascular steal symptoms on [**2182-5-9**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Pt says the pain and swelling the the digits started within a few days of the operation.
There she had diminished L radial pulse with strong doppler signal.
Initial exam felt consistent with paronychia.
No pus produced.
X ray performed and read as Soft tissue defect at the nail bad and osteomyelitis of the distal phalanx of the left 4th digit.
ON arrival the pt complaints of severe left finger pain and her dressing has quickly soaked through.

Anemia Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Family History: Diabetes, hypertension in several family members   Physical Exam: VS: T96.9, BP 201/60, 65, 22, 98% GENERAL: elderly appears AA female in moderate painful distress.
ABDOMEN: Soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding.
Left 3rd digit with 1cm incision along radial aspect with wick exposed, ongoing bleeding.
Given pain flexsion PIP, DIP limited.
LUE fistula with good thrill.
No obvious splinter hemrhorages.
muliple dark macules on palms / soles which appear chronic and nonblanching (therefore unlikely to be [**Last Name (un) **] lesions.
STUDIES: X-ray left finger: Soft tissue defect at the nail bad and osteomyelitis of the distal phalanx of the left 4th digit.
No st changes.
poor R wave progression.
MRI BRAIN:  Multiple areas of high signal in subcortical and periventricular distribution are redemonstrated on FLAIR imaging, compatible with small vessel ischemic disease.
Mild prominence of sulci and ventricles is again noted, suggestive of global atrophy.
There is no evidence of acute infarction.
On T2-weighted images, there is high signal intensity involving the left pons, compatible with remote infarction.
MRA BRAIN:  There is severe stenosis involving bilateral posterior cerebral arteries.
Severe stenosis of the right distal M1 and M2 segments of the right middle cerebral artery are demonstrated.
A supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery appears markedly narrowed.
These multiple foci of stenosis were not visualized on most recent CTA of [**2182-5-27**].
Multiple severe stenoses involving posterior and anterior circulation, as detailed above.
These findings appear new from [**2182-5-27**] CTA exam and are concerning for vasculitis or vasospasm due to meningitis.
Small vessel ischemic disease.
Old left pontine infarction.
C-Head:1. no large acute major territorial infarction, intracranial hemorrhage or mass.
Stable hyperdensity likely calcification in left frontal lobe (2,24) unchanged in size and appearance since [**2182-5-27**].
Within this limitation: a) Stable appearance of bilateral proximal cavernous ICA with e/o stenoses due to calcified atheromatous plaque with normal caliber and contrast enhancement distal to these segments.
b) Calcified atheromatous plaque involving the intracranial vertebral arteries is noted with small area of focal stenosis of the right vertebral artery.
c) Remaining vessels show no definite flow limiting stenosis, or aneurysm > 3mm.
Brief Hospital Course: # Finger infection: Concerned initially for deep tissue infection, however I+D without pus x 2 in the ED.
Blood cultures eventually grew multiple strains of bacteria including CONS and GNRs with high levels of resistence.
A PICC line was placed on [**2182-6-2**] for meropenem dosing.
Her pain was controlled with tylenol RTC.
# HTN: BP 201/60 in the setting of pain on admission.
Chronic hypertensive on multiple agents.
EKG without ischemic changes.
Pt without chest pain, HA, vision changes, or abd pain suggestive of hypertensive emergency.
Blood pressures were well-controlled after pain controlled on her home regimen.
# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Pt had acute altered mental status while on the medicine floors.
CODE stroke was called, and pt had urgent CT head that demonstrated no ICH.
MRI head was done which showed was concerning for possible MCA territory infarction but could also have been artifact that was not seen on the prior CTA Head.
She underwent a repeat head CT which revealed no changes from the prior one.
Her EEG revealed epileptiform waves on the right side consistent with seizures.
# DM: continued home doses of NPH and HISS  # CAD/PVD: continued statin, BB, imdur, ASA 81mg  # ESRD on HD MWF:  continued her regular dialysis sessions here and continued renal caps and calcium accetate.
# thrombocytopenia: at baseline.

You were seen by the plastic surgeons who cleaned out your hand infection and recommend dressing changes and soaks (in a solution of betadyne and saline) twice a day.
You also had an event during which your brain did not seem to be functioning as well as it usually does.
You had a ct scan and MRI of your head which did not reveal a stroke or mass or infection.
You had an EEG which showed a seizure.
