Interpretation assigned to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 168**], MD, Interpreting physician     Brief Hospital Course: Admitted for intravenous heparin prior to cardiac catherization to bridge off coumadin due to mechanical mitral valve.
Underwent preoperative workup including cardiac catherization, carotid ultrasound, and head CT,  Was brought to the operating [****] for aortic and tricuspid valve replacement and epicardial leads with new pacemaker generator.
In the first twenty foru hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated without complications.
Dobhoff tube was placed due to absent gag and swallow evaluation ordered.
