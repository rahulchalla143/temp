She returned to the ER with abdominal pain x1 day.
She was in good health until earlier this summer when she presented to an OSH with vaginal bleeding and was found to be thrombocytopenic.
Heme review of her smear showed question of intraerythrocytic parasites and she was briefly started on atovaquone and azithromycin.
These were subsequently discontinued as it was felt she did not have an acute Babesia infection.
In subsequent workup by hematology she was diganosed with ITP, treated with prednisone, and ultimately underwent a splenectomy on [**2175-9-9**] when she had recurrent vaginal bleeding.
The day of presentation she experiences severe intermittent low abdominal pain, sharp-pulsating in quality.
She had some sweats associated with the abdominal pain and fever, but denies any rigors.
She was evaluated by the surgical consult who felt she had no acute surgical issues.
Has 2PIVs, no foley.
On evaluation in the MICU, she reports her abdominal pain is significantly improved.
She does endorse mild urinary urgency.
She denies nausea but had an episode of vomiting at home.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 72481**] is a 34 year old woman with a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenia s/p splenectomy and on corticosteroids who was diagnosed with Babesiosis and returns with fevers and abdominal pain.
Babesiosis: Patient presenting with mild abdominal pain which had improved significantly at the time of arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Given her recent splenectomy, she is at risk for severe disease, although she may have had a smoldering infection unmasked by her recent surgery.
Her blood pressure remained stable and her abdominal pain resolved on hospital day 2, and she was transferred to the floor.
She continued to spike intermittent fevers and her parasitemia continued to rise, which peaked at 9.5% on hospital day 5.
She was afebrile with a parasitemia of 0.1% on the day of discharge.
Fevers: Most likely due to Babesiosis.
Co-infection with other tick-borne illnesses such as lyme and ehrlichia was considered.
Her fevers defervesced as her parasitemia improved, and she had been afebrile for 72 hours on the day of discharge.
Headache and tinnitus: Patient complained of pressure-like headache with bilateral tinnitus.
A CT head was negative for intracranial bleeding.
Tinnitus was likely secondary to cinchonism from quinine which she received x 1 on presentation to the ED.
Headache is common side effect of babesiosis infection.
Due to perisistent headache despite declining parasite load, the patient underwent a lumbar puncture which had a normal opening pressure and was negative for infection.
She received morphine as needed for the headache.
Abdominal pain: Surgery was consulted in the ED and did not feel she had an acute abdomen.
CT abdomen was negative for any acute process.
This was likely related to babesiosis and resolved on day two of hospitalization.
Thrombocytopenia: The patient had thrombocytopenia on presentation.
It was unclear whether this was secondary to ITP, Babesiosis, or Erlichiosis.
She was started on doxycycline to empirically cover for Erlichiosis and which is also used as an additional [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for severe Babesiosis.
Hematology felt that the patient did have ITP and the patient will follow-up in [**Hospital **] clinic following discharge.
Anemia: likely due to hemolysis from Babesiosis infection.
Senna 1 tab PO bid prn constipation 6.
Dilaudid [**2-3**] tab PO q4-6h prn pain   Discharge Medications: 1.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for headache.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Babesiosis Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Anemia  Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable, headache improved.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for an infection with Babesiosis.
You also had low platelet levels which required platelet transfusion and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment.
This is important to prevent reinfection with babesiosis or other tick-born infections.
Please seek medical attention if you develop a severe headache, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, lightheadedness, abdominal pain, or bleeding.
