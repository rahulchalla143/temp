HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 42-year-old male with on significant past medical history but a family history of coronary artery disease who presented after cardiac arrest at work.
The patient had been sitting in his office when he observed to have seizure like activity and then became apneic and unresponsive.
He was then found to be in asystole which converted spontaneously to atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate of 150.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at the outside hospital where he was found to be in atrial fibrillation in the 140s with nonspecific changes on his electrocardiogram.
A STAT echocardiogram was performed and showed an ejection fraction of 20% with global hypokinesis.
A repeat echocardiogram revealed global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 15%.
Chest x-ray done showed question of a right upper lobe density.
He had described vague sensation of chest pain before he developed this episode of unresponsiveness.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  No past medical history of medical illness.
Patient denied any history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension or hypercholesterolemia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease in the early 50s.
No history of sudden death.
Review of telemetry showed sinus in the 90s.
On general exam, the patient was a fairly well-appearing intubated man in no apparent distress.
Neck examination revealed no lymphadenopathy and jugular venous distention that was hard to assess.
Cardiac exam revealed regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 and no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm at 90, normal axis, left atrial enlargement, normal intervals and T wave flattening in III and aVL.
Outside hospital electrocardiograms revealed atrial fibrillation at 120 with normal axis and no ST-T or Q changes.
Another electrocardiogram from the outside hospital revealed normal sinus rhythm at 75, normal axis, [**Doctor Last Name 7491**], and T wave flattening in III and aVL.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 42-year-old man with family history of early coronary artery disease presented with ventricular fibrillation arrest.
Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with no personal cardiac risk factors but a history of early coronary artery disease in his family.
The etiologies for his ventricular fibrillation arrest included an acute coronary syndrome secondary to drug use such as cocaine, although, the patient denied ever using drugs.
Also, cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and primary arrhythmia were in the differential.
From a coronary artery disease standpoint, the patient had history of familial coronary artery disease, but no other risk factors.
His electrocardiogram post cardioversion was quite unremarkable and did not suggest structural heart disease, however, the patient did undergo coronary catheterization which revealed elevated left-sided pressures but clean coronary arteries.
He ruled out for myocardial infarction.
From a myocardium standpoint, the patient had globally depressed ejection fraction at the outside hospital initially requiring inotropic support for cardiogenic shock.
Differential for this included acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
It was thought that the patient's depressed ejection fraction may have been secondary to multiple defibrillations.
Dopamine was easily weaned off and the patient was diuresed to lower his left-sided filling pressures with a goal PAD of less than 18.
Patient was initially heparinized for a decreased ejection fraction.
This revealed a decreased systolic function globally.
Cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronaries, elevated right and left-sided pressures, right atrium pressure of 17, PA systolic of 49, pulmonary capillary wedge of 31, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 35 and cardiac output of 7.5.
From a conduction standpoint, the patient had an episode of ventricular arrest, then atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, status post cardioversion.
Patient underwent ICD placement without difficulty.
Patient subsequently reverted to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
He subsequently reverted back to atrial fibrillation after a brief period of time in sinus rhythm.
Patient underwent cardioversion times three with brief conversions to normal sinus rhythm but then recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
When the patient was having his AICD placed in the Electrophysiology Laboratory, he was internally cardioverted twice with recurrence of his atrial fibrillation.
He will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as an outpatient for INR checks and for continued management of his dilated cardiomyopathy.
Renal:  The patient presented with prerenal azotemia, which resolved while in hospital.
Review of these results revealed negative serologies for hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.  Repeat of the patient's LFTs on the day of discharge showed no abnormal.
prn nausea for four days.
Cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular fibrillation, status post AICD placement.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Dilated cardiomyopathy.
Acute renal failure.
