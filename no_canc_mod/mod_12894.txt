Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-1-26**], the degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has slightly increased.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo M h/o Parkinson's disease, DM, HTN, p/w progressive hypoxia, shortness of breath, treated for CHF exac and possible pneumonia (briefly received empiric antibiotics) and requiring MICU stay.
Found to have markedly increased R pleural effusion and had thoracocentesis after which he had considerable symptomatic improvement.
Pleural fluid was exudative with many WBCs and negative for malignant cells.
CT chest was concerning for left lower lobe nodule which was stable since [**Month (only) 205**] but increased since [**2146**].
# Shortness of Breath/Hypoxia and R pleural effusion: Presented [**9-1**] with hypoxia and dyspnea for 1 week.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] son called EMS due to worsening symptoms.
He was given S/L nitroglycerine and furosemide and had some improvement.
On presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**], clinically (given mild LE edema, elevated JVP) and with raised proBNP 4607 there was likely an element of CHF in addition to large right pleural effusion.
He was ruled out for a cardiac event and there was no history of chest pain or arrythmia and CEs were stable and essentially normal (max 0.03 and stable in the setting of CRF) with a generally unchanged ECG.
Echocrdiogram on [**2148-9-2**] showed a mildly dilated LA, mild LVH and a normal EF>55%, mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] pulmonary hypertension which had increased since [**2146**].
He was started on empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone and vancomycin) in the setting of a large R-sided pleural effusion seen on CXR of unclear etiology.
After the thoracocentesis, his symptoms improved dramatically and his O2 requirement decreased over the next 24 hours to 2L NC.
He had a CT-chest which showed the large right pleural effusion which was new since [**2148-7-8**], emphysema, healed rib fractures and more worryingly, a mixed solid and ground-glass left lower lobe nodule, concerning for bronchoalveolar carcinoma with a central adenocarcinoma but which has been stable since [**2148-7-8**] but enlarged since [**2147-3-9**].
His antibiotics were stopped given normal WBCs and no evidence of fevers.
On discharge, there was still a large right-sided effusion present both clinically and radiologically.
His pleural effusion will likely re-accumulate and this may necessitate a further aspiration in the future.
Possible causes of this exudative effusion include 1) A malignant effusion given the left lower lob nodule although this has been present since [**2146**] but latterly stable this year.
Of note, the pleural fluid cytology showed no malignant cells.
2) an inflammatory effusion given recent hemothorax following rib fractures 3) a parapneumonic effusion although WBCs were normal throughout his stay and sputum was negative (NB no culture or gram stain seem to have been done on pleural fluid).
An effusion due to CHF is less likely given the exudative nature.
# Chronic Renal Failure: Remained at baseline despite diuresis.
Given previous renal cysts, he had an U/S renal tract which showed multiple simple renal cysts bilaterally and no evidence of frank malignancy in addition to a persistent large right pleural effusion.
# Anemia: Hb around 8 in hospital as opposed to 9 which was his baseline.
there were no signs of active bleeding.
He had previous low Fe and high haptoglobin.
Given his worsening PD symptoms over several months and several falls including one which resulted in significant injury when he sustained several rib fractures a neurology review will be organised as an out-patient in case his PD treatment can be further optimised.

You presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with increasing shortness of breath and a productive cough.
Your PCP had [**Name9 (PRE) 60251**] treated you for possible pneumonia with antibiotics and also treated you for worsening heart failure with furosemide and home oxygen.
There, you were treated with further furosemide (lasix) to treat fluid on the lung (pulmonary edema) due to your heart failure and due to your oxygen level being low, you were transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for observation and further investigation.
You were found to have a large amount of fluid in the right side of your chest and this was drained by insertion of a needle into your chest.
Following this procedure, you felt much better and your shortness of beath in particular was dramatically improved.
You were briefly treated with antibiotics and these were stopped as your blood tests showed no evidence of infection and you did not have any fevers.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] to the cause of your fluid in your chest, the exact cause is uncertain however it is likely due to irritation of the lining of the lung following blood in the chest after your rib fractures.
Also it is possible that a resolved infection may have contributed in combination with worsening heart failure.
In addition, you had noted worsening of your Parkinson's Disease and have felt unsetady on your feet and this has resulted in falls during which you have injured yourself.
Most notably, you sustained rib factures after your last fall which required you to be admitted  to hospital back in [**Month (only) 205**].
If you feel more short of breath you should seek medical attention.
If you have any fevers you should also seek medical attention as you may require antibiotics.
