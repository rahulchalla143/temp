Admission Date:  [**2169-12-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-12-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-10-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: Dysarthria and left facial droop - code stroke  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 18699**] is a 72 year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation supposedly on coumadin and hypertension who presented to the ED with dysarthria and left facial droop.
Her symptoms were first noted at 3 pm when her daughter called to check on her and noticed that she had slurred speech and difficulty finding words.
The patient also noted weakness in her right hand.
Ms. [**Known lastname 18699**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] any prior history of neurologic deficits.
Ms. [**Known lastname 18699**] also [**Known lastname **] any prior history of heart problems including problems with high heart rate or fluid in the lungs.
She says she is able to lie flat at night and never gets short of breath.
The neurology team did not think she was a candidate for TPA given her stroke score.
Head CT showed no bleed, but while in the scanner she developed afib with RVR into the 180s and then developed respiratory distress.
Hypertension 2.
Atrial fibrillation on warfarin but recently ran out of her medication 3.
Hypothyroidism  Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 18699**] lives alone and manages her own medications and all of her own affairs.
Physical Exam: VS T 98 HR 94, RR 20, BP 176/74, 100% on bipap 10/5 Gen: Lying in bed, Bipap mask in place HEENT: Pupils round and reactive Neck: Supple, no carotid bruit CV: Irregular, faint heart sounds Lung: Clear Abd: Soft, nontender, nondistended.
R facial droop with mild/moderate dysarthria.
Appears near full strength except for mild FE weakness bilaterally.
No pronator drift and symmetric reflexes throughout.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
MRI of head [**12-10**]: Likely subacute infarction within the left frontal and parietal lobes, with the parietal infarcts having a small hemorrhagic component  CTA of head and neck: 1.
CT head demonstrates hypodensity in the right occipital lobe due to infarct of undetermined age.
Diffuse hypodensities are seen in the white matter including in the left frontal lobe which could be secondary to small vessel disease.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates some tortuosity of the left vertebral artery which is small in size and could be due to cervical spondylosis.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
MRI can help for further assessment to assess for acute infarct.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 18699**] is a 72 year-old right handed woman with atrial fibrillation not taking her warfarin who presented with ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and flash pulmonary edema.
Acute ischemic stroke: No evidence of bleed on CT.
Transferred to neurology when MRI showed acute stroke of L frontal/parietal lobe most likely embolic given her atrial fibrillation and subtherapeutic INR.
Echocardiogram showed no evidence of thrombus or ASD/PFO.
Patient needs to continue Coumadin given her Afib with goal INR between 2~3.0.
Flash pulmonary edema: Patient with new, sudden hypoxia in the ED as well as exam findings consistent with acute pulmonary edema.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate:  She was supposed to be taking both metoprolol and diltiazem at home, but unclear if taking.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Stroke - L MCA distribution (cortical) Atrial fibrillation  Discharge Condition: Alert and oriented to self, place and date.
Fluent speech but mildly dysarthric.
Slight right facial droop but near full strength throughout with mild hand weakness.
Discharge Instructions: You came in with sudden onset of slurred speech and R arm weakness.
You were admitted to the stroke service and MRI of head showed that you have a new left subcortical stroke (posterior limb of internal capsule) likely embolic stroke due to atrial fibrillation.
Given the new, relatively small stroke and your atrial fibrillation, you were initially bridged with heparin but heparin was discontinued the day prior to your discharge given small hemorrhagic transformation and normal echocardiogram.
