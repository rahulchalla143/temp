The patient was intermittently awake, arousable, and serum toxicology positive for benzodiazepines.
The patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain.
Ethanol abuse, multiple prior hospitalizations for withdrawal and detoxification; no known history of delirium tremens in the past 2.
History of pancreatitis 4.
Librium as needed  ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Recent stressors in the patient's life include granddaughter's surgery and financial difficulties.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   For five to six days prior to admission to [**Hospital6 8283**], the patient reportedly drank five to six gallons of hard alcohol.
Localizes pain in shoulder.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, regular S1 and S2, no murmurs.
Musculoskeletal:  Positive pain with limited range of motion over left shoulder, no gross deformities or effusions.
Serum toxicology positive for benzodiazepines, negative for ethanol.
Head CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage.
Neurology:  The patient's ethanol withdrawal and delirium tremens were treated with increasing doses of Ativan and Haldol.
Additionally, the patient was put on a propofol drip briefly for help with his withdrawal.
Over the course of two weeks in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was slowly tapered off the Ativan drip, as there was noted improvement in his withdrawal symptoms.
Pulmonary:  The patient was briefly intubated secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure from narcotics.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had an episode of hypotension in response to propofol.
Post-extubation and post-weaning of the Ativan drip, the patient became hypertensive and his Zestril and Lopressor were slowly added to his medical regimen, with adequate control of his blood pressure.
Infectious Disease:  The patient had several episodes of fever spikes and increased white blood cell count during the course of his stay in the hospital.
Initially his fevers were thought to be secondary to alcohol withdrawal, however, in light of increased white blood cell count and questionable left lower lobe opacity, the patient was briefly treated with a course of vancomycin.
However, in light of resolution of left lower lobe opacity and decrease in his white blood cell count, the patient's antibiotics were subsequently discontinued.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was continued on intravenous Protonix given his history of alcohol-induced gastritis.
