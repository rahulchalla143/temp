The patient presented with complaints of three hours of [**2-28**] chest pain with radiation to his left arm.
He had associated nausea and SOB.
His previous presentation prior to his last cath was of increasing dyspena on exertion.
He denied having a history of chest pain.
ECG demonstrated ST elevations I, II, AVL, V2-V6 with ST depressions AVR.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He admits to awakening occasionally with about an hour of subjective fevers/chills, but has had no persistent fevers.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD s/p bare metal stent to the proximal LAD placed 2 years ago  NIDDM Hypertension   Social History: He works at a sausage cart vendor [**Hospital1 98542**].
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
Right femoral area has bandage with some blood present in place.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Anterolateral myocardial infarction with ST-T wave configuration consistent with acute process.
Limited resting hemodyanmics revealed systemic arterial normotension.
Final angiography showed an excellent result in the treated lesion with no residual stenoses, residual thrombus or flow-limiting dissection.
IVUS of the proximal LAD (including the old stent and the whole segment), showed an MLD of 4.3 mm and well apposed stent without  residual thrombus or dissection.
Single vessel coronary artery disease with ST elevation MI from acute thrombotic occlusion of the proximal LAD consistent with very-late stent thrombosis.
[**Name (NI) 18583**] PTCA of the proximal LAD lesion (including the stent) with 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5 mm balloons with excellent final result.
Embolic occlusion of the distal diagonal .
Complete smoking cessation, weight loss (minimum of 10% of current weight), and best medical management for secondary prevention (target BP < 130/80, LDL <70, HDL>45, TG<150).
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior wall, septum and apex.
Anterior wall and septum appear slightly edematous, suggesting a recent MI.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w recent LAD-territory myocardial infaction.
Very small pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 98543**] is a 52 year-old male with pmh of hypertension, HL, CAD s/p bare metal stent in [**2102**] admitted with a STEMI secondary to an instent thrombosis s/p thrombectomy.
CORONARIES/STEMI: The patient presented with chest pain and STE in V2-V6, I, II, aVL.
Cardiac catheterization showed instent thrombosis of the proximal LAD bare metal stent (previously placed around 2 years prior).
He had the thrombosis removed and was admitted to the CCU.
The patient had a TTE which showed apical akinesis and a depressed ejection fraction.
Disp:*90 Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Acute systolic Dysfunction with EF 25% Hypertention Diabetes mellitus type 2   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You had a clot in your stent that caused a heart attack.
You are also at risk for fluid retention because of your heart fucntion.
