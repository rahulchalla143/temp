History of Present Illness: This 76 year old male with known cardiac disease status who is post mechanical Aortic valve replacement in [**2119**], has had multiple failed cardioversions with the most recent in [**April 2133**] (on Coumadin-last dose [**2133-8-16**].
He presented to another institution with  increased shortness of breath, lower leg edema, worsening fatigue  and a 13 pound weight gain over the past 3 weeks.

No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
A focal deficit cannot be completely excluded due to poor image quality.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
A paravalvular aortic valve leak of moderate intensity is noted in the region of native LEFT coronary cusp close to the ostium of the left main coronary artery.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with high flows from regurgitant lesions.
There is mild prolapse of the posterior leaflet and anterior leaflet restriction.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (peak gradient 13mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Eccentric and severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a bioprosthesis in the mitral position.
Trace valvular and perivalvular mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a bioprosthesis located in the aotic position.
There appears to be at least trace aortic insufficiency which can be seen in limited views.
Tricuspid regurgitation is unchanged (2+).
Biventricular systolic function appears preserved, although regional wall motion abnormalities cannot be fully excluded.
There appears to be septal dysynchrony consistent with V-pacing.
[**2133-8-20**] Carotid Ultrasoound Impression: Right ICA with no stenosis.
Left ICA with no stenosis.
Relatively minimal vascular calcification of the thoracic aorta.
The appearances are suggestive of asymmetric pulmonary edema, although an infectious/diffuse inflammatory process may be present without a frank consolidation.
Multiple renal lesions are seen.
However, whether these representing a hyperdense/hemorrhagic cysts, versus vascular mass cannot be determined on this examination without intravenous contrast.
Multiple other smaller lesions are also present within the bilateral kidneys, too small for characterization as well.
Based on the ultrasound examination of [**2133-8-19**], the interpolar lesion in the left kidney appears to represent a cyst, and based on its density today, a hemorrhagic cyst.
Given the patient's estimated GFR of approximately 26 as of the test from one day ago, the patient may be a candidate for MRI with contrast(ProHance), if differentiation of this being a solid mass/neoplasm versus a complex cystic mass will alter the patient's continued management.
No related adenopathy is seen within the chest, abdomen, or pelvis to suggest a metastatic renal neoplasm.
Dominant right-sided nodule with some peripheral calcifications.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2133-8-19**] for surgical management of his coronary artery and valvular heart disease.
A right renal mass was discovered and a urology consult was obtained.
A CT scan was obtained which did not show any metastatic disease that would delay surgery and a delayed workup was recommended.
On [**2133-9-1**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a redo sternotomy with coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels, redo aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, left atrial ligation and MAZE procedure.
His creatinine was noted to be elevated and the renal service continued to closely follow him.
He had some respiratory difficultuy requiring Bipap with good effect.
Coumadin and Amiodarone were resumed for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
He was seen by the Physical Therapy service for mobility and strength.
His creatinine gradually fell to 2.9 at discharge and Lasix was begun at a low dose to facilitate clearance of his leg edema.
