She then became unresponsive w/ PEA arrest.
BP stable w/ SBP in 150s.
12 lead EKG was obtained and revealed ST elevations in aVR and V1-V3 with reciprocal ST depressions in V5 and V6.
Repeat EKGs revealed persistence of ST elevations and plans were made to take her to cath.
Stat CXR revealed improvement in her pleural effusions from earlier today, but still w/ persistent hilar fullness.
For PMH, she has known CAD s/p PCI to Lcx in [**2163**] (at the time, was found to have 2VD), CHF, HTN, DM type II, and COPD.
She would have SOB ("gasping for air") mostly with walking [**9-17**] feet.
No medication noncompliance or dietary indiscretion.
Labs were notable for elevated BNP and trop 0.77.
EKG with NSR, rate 63, ST dep 1 mm in I, avL, V5-V6, no ST segment elevation.
TWI in I, avL, V4, flat TW in V5-V6.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for CHF exacerbationWas transferred up to the floor where she appeared to do well overnight.
Limited angiography of the left coronary artery demonstrated moderate disease of the LAD with stenoses of the proximal and mid artery.
The circumflex artery had a total occlusion after the takeoff of a large first OM.
COPD - on home O2 of 3L 4.
HTN 5.

VS - T 99.8, BP 107/61, HR 90-100, RR 18, sats 100% by vent Vent: AC FiO2 100%, Tv 500 (set), Tv 530 (actual), PEEP 5, RR 14  Gen: Sedated, intubated HEENT: Sclera anicteric Neck: Supple, JVP CV: RR, NL S1, S2, no m/r/g appreciated.
Ext: Bilateral LE 2+ edema up 1/3 of shins, +chronic venous stasis changes .
Pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions are present, obscuring the cardiac contours.
There is no pneumothorax.
Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 30119**] is an 84yo F admitted on [**2180-1-8**] for progressively worsening dyspnea x 1 week felt to be a CHF exacerbation +/- NSTEMI developed dizziness tonight and, per tele, became bradycardic w/ complete heart block.
She then became unresponsive w/ PEA arrest.
BP stable w/ SBP in 150s.
12 lead EKG was obtained and revealed ST elevations in aVR and V1-V3 with reciprocal ST depressions in V5 and V6.
Repeat EKGs revealed persistence of ST elevations and plans were made to take her to cath.
Stat CXR revealed improvement in her pleural effusions from earlier today, but still showed persistent hilar fullness.
Labs were drawn and showed elevated cardiac enzymes.
Her family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and made aware of need for urgent cardiac cath, and with her EKG changes, the likely possibility of left main disease with probable need for CABG.
Pt is a poor surgical candidate currently and with this in mind, and with the knowledge of the patient's wishes, the family did not want to proceed with cardiac catheterization.
