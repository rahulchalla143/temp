A CTA showed no evidence of anuerysm.
On Hospital day 2 she underwent a cerebral angiogram which did not show any sign of aneursym either, though the neurosurgeon doing procedure (from [**Hospital6 **]) recommended repeating angiogram in two weeks.
Neurologically she remained intact with no deficits, a trial of toradol and antiemetics were tried for her headache without much improvement she continued to be photophobic.
She was found to have significant paraspinal muscle spasms.
Dilaudid was discontinued and she was started on valium, a soft neck collar, cold packs, and a lidoderm patch.
A lidocoine injection into the paraspinal muscles was recommended and attempted but ultimately refused by the patient (neck spasms had improved spontaneously).
She was prescribed tizanidine, valium, percocet, and naproxen for headache and neck stiffness.
