BACKGROUND: Included a well-formed 9 Hz alpha frequency in posterior areas bilaterally during wakefulness.
There were no focal abnormalities or epileptiform features.
NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or edema.
ECHO [**2-28**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are stigmata of chronic liver disease with nodular, atrophied liver and moderate amount of perihepatic and perisplenic ascites.
There is a single hepatic hypodensity, which is too small to characterize, but likely a benign cyst, without change on delayed phase imaging.
There is no biliary dilatation.
Moderate amount of mesenteric edema is evident, likely on the basis of increased portal pressures.
PELVIS: There is a fat-containing umbilical hernia.
There is a left renal cyst.
Nondistended bladder is seen in the deep pelvis.
There is a small amount of pelvic ascites.
Atherosclerotic calcifications.
No focal osseous lesions.
IMPRESSION: Stigmata of chronic liver disease including cirrhotic shrunken liver, ascites, recanalized umbilical vein, splenomegaly and varices.
Conventional hepatic arterial anatomy.
No suspicious focal hepatic lesions.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION:  48 y/o male w/ HCV cirrhosis, ESLD, w/ hx of varices and encephalopathy who presents from OSH, w/ tylenol ingestion, and likely psychosis.
# Homicidal ideation w/ ?
Psychosis vs. Delirium: Pt appears to be responding to internal stimuli.
He has no active plans of Suicide or murder.
Psychiatry feels that the waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] does not fit entirely with a primary psychiatric disorder.
However patient is atypical for hepatic encephalopathy.
Also of note, wife and son were notified of these homicidal ideations on [**3-7**].
Patient with ascites, and unclear if compliant with diuretics.
Continued on nadolol dose reduced from 40mg to 20mg for history of esophageal varices.
Felt that patient did not have SBP clinically.
#Tylenol ingestion: history consistent with daily tylenol ingestion on a cirrhotic liver, though exact dose/intent/timing is unclear.
Probably related to anemia of chronic disease given liver disease.
#Leukopenia: Stable, likely related to liver disease.
Chronic back pain: continue oxycontin.
PPx: Avoided heparin sq, as patient all ready coagulopathic.
# Dispo: Depending on psych issues.
Risperidone 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO PRN (as needed) as needed for agitation.

Thrombocytopenia 3.
Leukopenia 5.
Chronic lower back pain   Discharge Condition: stable, normotensive SBP 100   Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **] you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 2737**] out of concern for your mental status changes and your high tylenol levels.
There was also intial concern that you might have an infection in your abdomen, but this was felt not to be the case by the team.
You had a test called an RPR which rule out any syphyllis causing your confusion.
You did not have any infection in your urine.
As a result we are transitioning you to a psychiatry facitilty to determine if you have a primary psychiatric problem on top of your other liver issues, and to further assess if you are a danger to yourself or others.
