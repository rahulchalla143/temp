Admission Date:  [**2119-9-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2119-9-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2052-2-14**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old woman who presented with shortness of breath and heart failure.
The patient stated that she had been having worsening lower extremity edema, increasing abdominal girth, weight gain, and increasing shortness of breath over the last ten days.
Also the patient has been seen in the clinic recently with labs that showed severe prerenal azotemia, in addition to her fluid retention.
The patient has a known history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and hypertension.
She has had multiple admissions for severe fluid retention with renal insufficiency.
Both catheterization and echocardiogram in [**2118**] showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mitral regurgitation.
Since her admission on [**2119-7-7**], she has gained at least 20 lbs, recurrent massive lower extremity edema and exertional shortness of breath.
The patient was referred today from the clinic to the CCU for an elective Swan-Ganz to help assess her intracardiac pressures and adjust her medications accordingly to see if we can prevent her recurrent admissions for congestive heart failure.
The patient on admission was also noted to have a hematocrit of 19, but she denied melena and hematemesis.
She did note that she has had some blood streaked stools.
Diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease.
She has had multiple catheterizations.
History of congestive heart failure.
Last echocardiogram was [**2119-9-21**], which showed an ejection fraction of 60-65%, left atrial enlargement, right atrial enlargement, trace aortic insufficiency, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, with severe pulmonary hypertension.
She has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on Amiodarone and Coumadin.
History of pulmonary embolism in [**2117**].
History of chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline of 1.1.
Depression and anxiety.
Borderline personality disorder.
Peripheral vascular disease.
FAMILY HISTORY:  She had a father who died of myocardial infarction at 47 and mother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer.
General:  She was a pleasant, pale, female in no acute distress.
There was a 3 out of 6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border and at the right upper sternal border.
She also had guaiac positive brown stool.
No evidence of blood.
Extremities:  No clubbing or cyanosis, but she had 3+ pitting edema in both lower extremities.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  She was a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure, with multiple admissions, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and Amiodarone, diabetes type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and hyperthyroidism, presenting with worsening congestive heart failure symptoms and anemia, as well as elevated BUN and creatinine ratio, and anemia with a hematocrit of 19.8.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had an exam consistent with congestive heart failure.
We will place a Swan-Ganz to assess .............. possibility once her elevated INR has been decreased.
After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], we decided not to place an NG tube because of elevated INR and the fear of aspiration.
Endocrine:  She has a history of hyperthyroidism on Synthroid.
Swan numbers revealed pulmonary artery hypertension but also an elevated wedge felt to be due to left heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction.
The patient was diuresed with Lasix, and throughout the hospital course, lost 10 kg with complete resolution of her 3+ lower extremity pitting edema.
Once her heart failure resolved, she was restarted on her home medications, Lopressor 25 b.i.d.
Pulmonary:  The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram but has a history of PE.
GI:  EGD found erosions in the antrum that were small and localized.
There was no active bleeding or coffee-grounds and no evidence of recent GI bleed.
The small bowel was of normal caliber in the mucosal pattern, no mass lesions.
Hematocrit eventually stabilized around 31 with no evidence of further bleeding.
