HOSPITAL COURSE:  At presentation, a head CT revealed a coronal fracture, skull base fracture, left parietal subdural hematoma, and possible epidural hematoma with some shift in effacement of the ventricle along with a left intraparenchymal hemorrhage and a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The patient was taken emergently to the operating room at admission, where a left craniotomy for evacuation of the acute subdural hematoma was performed along with resection of the left temporal lobe for hemorrhagic contusion with a partial left anterior temporal lobectomy; and in addition, he had the left skull fracture repaired.
He was also placed on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
He was diagnosed with a persistent carotid-cavernous fistula, which was coiled during his angiogram.
Initially, he was placed on heparin after this procedure and eventually switched over to aspirin and Plavix for prophylaxisu after stent-assisted treatment of his persistent carotid-cavernous fistula.
He will need to continue on Plavix/ASA until further notice to prevent thrombosis of the Jostent Graftmaster stent-graft in his carotid artery.
He tolerated the removal of the PEG tube without difficulty and had a good appetite and had no difficulty maintaining an oral diet.
His trach tube was successfully discontinued on postoperative day number 44, and the patient did not have any complications from the removal of the trach tube.
