Admission Date:  [**2141-4-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-4-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-4-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**] Chief Complaint: Chief Complaint: Lethargy and abnormal labs  Reason for MICU transfer: Sepsis and acute encephalopathy   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 84 year old male with history of senile/vascular dementia (baseline AAOx1), sick sinus/syncope s/p PPM, moderate AS (TTE in [**2134**]), and prior MRSA pneumonia, referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED from her nursing home ([**Hospital **] Rehab [**Telephone/Fax (1) 41602**]) with a 1-week history of lethargy and "abnormal labs", with only BUN slightly elevated.
He was placed on O2 and noted to be 88% on 2L NC with increased RR to 24 and noted decreased PO intake.
He has a CBI catheter with irrigation in place since last year for frequent UTI with recent change after a malfunction last week.
EMS was called and provided additional IVF given hypotension as well as supplemental O2 en route.
They noted his significant decline in mental status compared to that time and felt his leukopenia might be attributable to the [**Last Name (LF) 13401**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this is being transitioned to lamotrigine.
Exam was notable for complete disorientation (AAOx0), diaphoretic, opens eyes and responds to voice and name, guiaic negative brown stool, III-IV SEM heard throughout precordium, and a CBI catheter.
Urinalysis showed many WBCs, large leuk esterase with significant amount of bacteriuria and CXR showed concern for a RML/RLL infiltrate.
He is lethargic and unable to answer many questions but states that his breathing feels ok and and he denies any pain.
Past Medical History: - senile dementia - seizure disorder likely secondary to his vascular events (hasn't had seizure for quite awhile per nursing home reports; witnessed tonic-clonic seizure in [**4-/2135**] and then in [**7-/2135**]) - hypertension - abdominal aortic aneurysm - status post pacemaker placement ([**2134-10-18**]) for sick sinus/syncope ----[**Company 1543**] Enpulse DR E2DR31, last interrogation [**2140-7-31**] with atrial fibrillation with vent rate of 50-80, > 90% and has been since his clinic visit in [**Month (only) 958**].
He had no ventricular high rates.
- Last ECHO ([**2135-5-9**]), LVEF 60 %, moderate AS - history of vertebral body fracture - BPH - history of MRSA pneumonia - C. difficile colitis   Social History: Unable to obtain from the patient.
Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: Vitals:  HR 70 BP 106/45 RR 22 SpO2 97%/RA General: Lethargic, arousable to voice HEENT: Dry MMM Neck: JVP difficult to assess, appears to be 6-7cm CV: Irregular rhythm (demand paced), [**1-24**] crescendoo-descrescndo murmur heard through the precordium and the back Lungs: Quiet breath sounds but otherwise clear Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly, no tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding  GU: 3-way Foley in place Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: Patient not cooperative with full exam.
Lungs no rales appreciated anteriorly, but coarse bilaterally.
CV: irregular with 3/6 systolic harsh murmur heard throughout precordium.
Abdomen soft, NT, ND, NABS Ext:  no edema Neuro:  alert/oriented to self, in Valley forge, in hospital, not to date.
GU: foley catheter in place, yellow urine Skin:  small stage II ulcer on coccyx.
ECHO [**4-3**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a rhematic deformity of the tricuspid valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-5-9**], the degree of AS is now slightly more severe (mean gradient now 61 mmHg vs 38 mmHg on prior) with more hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
There is a right pleural effusion and right basilar consolidation.
No pneumothorax is detected on this view.
Heart and mediastinal contours are similar to [**2134**], but difficult to evaluate in the setting of low lung volumes.
IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion with right lower lung opacity, which could represent atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia.
Discharge labs: [**2141-4-6**] 08:45AM BLOOD WBC-1.9* RBC-3.67* Hgb-10.1* Hct-31.5* MCV-86 MCH-27.6 MCHC-32.1 RDW-15.3 Plt Ct-231 [**2141-4-6**] 08:45AM BLOOD Glucose-89 UreaN-6 Creat-1.0 Na-139 K-3.7 Cl-105 HCO3-27 AnGap-11  Brief Hospital Course: Impression: The patient is an 84 year old man with history of dementia, sick sinus syd s/p PPM, moderate AS, prior MRSA pneumonia and C. diff colitis, with indwelling catheter, and a seizure disorder, presenting with sepsis secondary to likely pulmonary sources.
Aspiration PNA may also have played a role given his RML/RLL infiltrates on CXR and his poor mental status with high risk for aspiration.
There was no report of fevers or diarrhea at rehab.
He was mildly hypotensive on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with SBP in the 80s on no pressors.
Urine culture was negative, and therefore cause of symptoms presumed due to aspiration pneumonia.
# Acute encephalopathy on admission Patient was reportedly more lethargic than usual, per direct discussion with the [**Hospital1 1501**] staff.
The most likely cause for his AMS was sepsis from UTI, but may also have been [**12-22**] to starting lamotrigine recently, although it would not have been expected to resolve as quickly as was noted if due to medications.
His underlying infection/sepsis may be acutely lowering his WBC, although he has evidence of leukopenia prior to his presentation for sepsis.
ANC at admission is 1300 and he is very mildly neutropenic, so concern for atypical infections was low.
He appears somewhat volume depleted on exam, he has no edema or crackles on exam.
His cardiac exam is consistent with a decreased S2, suggestive of critical AS.
Repeat TTE showed progression of his aortic stenosis, to severe.
As a result, he is likely to be very sensitive to low blood pressures.
# Hematuria and CBI: Patient presented from rehab with a 3-way Foley and CBI.
Has had negative cystoscopy and CT urogram with no clear cause for his hematuria.
We stopped the CBI, with no hematuria, and changed his foley to a regular foley prior to discharge.
If he develops hematuria after a foley catheter change, this should be monitored for evidence of obstruction.
If he continues to have hematuria or obstruction, CBI can be started for 24-72 hours as needed until his urine clears again, at which point it should be stopped.
He should follow up with urology as needed if this persists.
This should be re-addressed with the brother again given severe aortic stenosis, and his degree of cognitive dysfunction.
Chronic issues: # Atrial fibrillation.
# Chronic dementia.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation & [**Hospital **] Care Center - [**Location 1268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia Dementia Seizure disorder Leukopenia, possibly related to anti-seizure medication  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Bedbound or out of bed with significant assistance.
You were treated for pneumonia.
We stopped the bladder irrigation and this should not be restarted.
