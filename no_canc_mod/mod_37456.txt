Admission Date:  [**2131-9-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2131-9-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2055-3-11**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (status post cardiac catheterization in [**2130-12-1**] with stent placement to the circumflex artery and a questionable history of myocardial infarction 25 years ago), hypertension, and chronic atrial fibrillation who was admitted to the CMI Service after and elective catheterization was performed on [**2131-9-4**] due to increasing dyspnea on exertion times one to two weeks and increasing frequency of chest pain.
The cardiac catheterization was complicated by bradycardia which required 0.5 mg of atropine.
On transfer, she denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.
No new low back pain.
She did complain of diffuse abdominal pain.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction approximately 25 years ago.
No history of diabetes or hypercholesterolemia.
Probable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; she is on 2 liters nasal cannula at home at night.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Her mother died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed the patient's vital signs in the Coronary Care Unit revealed initial blood pressure of 77/48, increased to 122/40, heart rate was 96 (in atrial fibrillation), and she was saturating 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Generally, she was a pale elderly female in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae were anicteric and pale.
Neck examination revealed jugular venous pulsation not appreciated at 30 degrees.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a irregular rate and rhythm.
A 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
The abdomen revealed mild diffuse tenderness to palpation.
No rebound or guarding.
Extremity examination revealed the right groin was without hematoma or bruits.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories of significance on admission revealed hematocrit fell from 36 to 29 and increased to 32 after 2 units of packed red blood cells.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Catheterization in [**2130-8-31**] revealed right coronary artery with 80% proximal circumflex, mild left axis deviation, left circumflex was stented, left middle cerebral artery was normal, pulmonary artery pressures were 31/16, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 17.
Catheterization on [**2131-9-4**] showed first obtuse marginal with 99% which received percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with 20% residual stenosis.
Left anterior descending artery with mild disease.
Right coronary artery with 100% stenosis which filled with collaterals.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
Persantine MIBI in [**2131-5-1**] revealed an ejection fraction of 60% with an apical ischemia, some fixed inferoseptal defects.
Electrocardiogram prior to catheterization revealed atrial fibrillation, heart rate of 54, a Q wave in lead III, early R wave transition.
Electrocardiogram status post catheterization revealed a right bundle-branch block and 1-mm to 2-mm ST depressions in leads V3 to V6, atrial fibrillation at a rate of 125.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was felt to be at an increased risk of bleed given that she had just had cardiac catheterization, and her hematocrit had dropped.
The patient had a computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis on the morning after admission which showed that she had a right retroperitoneal 5 X 6 hematoma.
A follow-up computed tomography on [**2131-9-6**] showed that the hematoma was stable, so no further action was taken at that time.
Of note, on the computed tomography, the patient was noted to have a 5-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm which was asymptomatic.
Her hematocrit levels remained stable afterwards, and she had no signs of further bleeding or infection at her groin site.
She was initially on dopamine which was discontinued due to tachycardia which was causing some demand ischemia.
She had no signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure throughout her hospital course.
(b)  Rhythm:  The patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation with occlusion bursts of rapid ventricular response.
Amiodarone was not started due to her baseline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  Her hematocrit had fallen due to an unknown etiology.
A computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed a retroperitoneal hematoma which was stable by follow-up computed tomography.
GASTROENTEROLOGY ISSUES:  For nausea and retching the patient was given antiemetics.
She had no response to Phenergan.
The nausea and vomiting resolved after the first night of admission.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a significant tobacco history.
She had no further episodes of chest pain or other problems.
Lastly, the patient was noted to have several loose stools on the evening of [**9-6**].
The patient had no further complaints.
If she had any recurrence of her chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or any other concerning symptoms please call medical doctor or return to the hospital.
Coronary artery disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
Anemia secondary to blood loss.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Right groin was without hematoma or bruits.
