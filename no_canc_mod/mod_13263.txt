HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 59190**] is a 77 year-old man, with a long history of aortic stenosis, followed by serial echocardiograms.
He has had a drop in his ejection fraction from 55 to 45 with some wall motion abnormalities present during the echocardiogram prior to his admission.
Catheterization report showed left main 60 percent, circumflex 70 percent, RCA 100 percent diagonal, 100 percent obtuse marginal, 80 percent concentric LVH with severe hypokinesis of the inferior base and mid to distal anterior wall.
A cardiac echocardiogram done during [**2146-1-1**] showed an ejection fraction of 45 percent with left atrial enlargement and an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm square with a peak gradient of 59 and a mean gradient of 40.
Echocardiogram additionally showed 1 plus mitral regurgitation and 1 plus tricuspid regurgitation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is significant for aortic stenosis, asbestosis, hiatal hernia, atrophic right kidney, chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.4, hypertension, Parkinson's disease, bladder cancer, status post chemotherapy 18 years ago and cataracts.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a father who died of a myocardial infarction and a mother who also died of a myocardial infarction.
Additionally, he has a brother who is still alive who has had a myocardial infarction in the past.
Chest CT done in [**2146-1-1**] showed asbestos related lung disease with an atrophic right kidney and a small hiatal hernia.
General:  No acute distress.
Skin with no lesions.
Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema and no varicosities.
His ventilator was weaned; however, his arterial blood gases remained inadequate to extubate as he had low tidal volumes when placed on pressure support ventilation.
Once on the floor, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course.
However, given the duration of his atrial fibrillation, the decision was made to anticoagulate the patient.
By postoperative day number six, the patient was experiencing periods of bradycardia on both Amiodarone and Metoprolol and the decision was made, at that time, to discontinue the Amiodarone and continue the beta blockade.
Incision was steri-stripped without erythema or drainage.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with no edema.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of    2.4.
