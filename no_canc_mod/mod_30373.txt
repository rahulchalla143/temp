Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo woman with H/O atrial fibrillation on Coumadin transferred from an outside hospital after she was found to have an elevated troponin in the setting of chest pain consistent with an NSTEMI.
# CAD/NSTEMI: Patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] where she had found to have a troponin I elevated to 5.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], she denied any further chest pain.
Initial troponin T was elevated at 0.41, with normal CK-MB and EKG suggestive of previous infarct.
Beta-blockade was held in the setting of bradycardia, and ACE-inhibitor was held due to renal function.
Transthoracic echocardiogram of suboptimal image quality showed normal overall and regional biventricular systolic function (LVEF >60%), mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic stenosis, and a small pericardial effusion.
On [**2142-11-8**], she underwent right and left heart catheterization, which showed PCW and LVEDP 20 mm Hg (consistent with moderate left ventricular diastolic heart failure of uncertain duration) and an 80% ulcerated lesion in the distal RCA.
At the time of discharge, she was prescribed on daily doses of ASA 325 mg, metoprolol succinate 25 mg, Plavix 75 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg. She remained chest pain free throughout her hospitalization and will follow-up with her PCP and primary cardiologist.
# Groin Hematoma - After removal of the patient's femoral arterial sheath post-catheterization, a large hematoma formed.
Patient became hypotensive and bradycardic, consistent with a vasovagal reaction.
She continued to have a large right thigh hematoma which was soft with no signs of extension and strong femoral and peripheral pulses.
# Congestive Heart failure: Patient appeared euvolemic on physical examination on admission.
She was noted to have an elevated BNP of 745 at [**Hospital1 **], suggestive of congestive heart failure.
Cardiac catheterization showed LVEDP and PCW of 20 mm Hg, consistent with isolated diastolic heart failure of uncertain duration.
The patient was not started on an ACE-inhibitor due to her renal function (SCr beginning at 2.1, rising to 2.6, consistent with stage acute kidney injury); she should follow-up with her primary cardiologist regarding starting an ACE-I/[**Last Name (un) **] for secondary prevention in the setting of CAD, tiny NSTEMI, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.
The patient should follow-up with her primary cardiologist regarding the need for ongoing nitrates (since her flow-limiting CAD was revascularized, and she was begun on beta-blockade).
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient noted to be in atrial fibrillation on presentation to [**Hospital1 **] with ventricular rates to the 140s.
She was monitored on telemetry without any evidence of atrial fibrillation.
# Acute on Chronic CKD: Per report, patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 2.0.
Elevation was attributed to volume depletion from diuresis and perhaps poor oral intake.
She was given a total of 1.5 liters of bicarbonate in D5W with improvement in creatinine to a nadir of 2.1.
Repeat UA/Cx here on [**11-5**] showed mixed bacteria consistent with skin contamination.
# Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive on admission with SBPs in to 180s requiring a nitroglycerin gtt.
Additionally she was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] for post-infarct secondary prevention.
The patient was hypotensive during sheath pull in the setting of acute blood loss anemia as above which improved with administration of 1L NS.
- Patient will follow up with her cardiologist regarding diuretic therapy, continuing Imdur, starting an ACE-I/[**Last Name (un) **] - Patient remained full code throughout this hospitalization  Medications on Admission: - ASA 81 mg daily - furosemide 20 mg daily - calcium with vitamin D - multivitamin - grapeseed extract - zolpidem 10 mg daily - warfarin 5 mg daily - omeprazole 20 mg - levothyroxine 50 mcg - isosorbide monitrate 60 mg daily - nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL - rosuvastatin 5 mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1. atorvastatin 80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Non ST elevation myocardial infarction Coronary artery disease Acute on chronic renal failure Post-catheterization hematoma and acute blood loss anemia requiring transfusion Transient hypotension consistent with vasovagal response Hypertension Urinary tract infection Atrial fibrillation, with long term use of anticoagulants Sinus bradycardia Hyperlipidemia Left ventricular diastolic heart failure of uncertain duration, likely chronic Hypothyroidism Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation Mild aortic stenosis  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
As you know you were admitted because you were having chest pain and were found to have a heart attack.
You were transferred here to have a cardiac catheterization.
After the procedure you had bleeding from the groin.
The bleeding was controlled with pressure and you improved.
Your coumadin was held while you were admitted due to bleeding.
