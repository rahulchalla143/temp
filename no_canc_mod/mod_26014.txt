Admission Date:  [**2124-11-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-11-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-12-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**] Chief Complaint: Pedestrian struck by car  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 21 yo woman s/p hit and run.
alert, oriented, responds to questions appropriately although affect flat HEENT:  Facial swelling and ecchymosis present.
Lacerations remains intact after suture removal without evidence of infection.
Pertinent Results: [**2124-11-5**] CXR: Low lung volumes, but right upper lung opacity could reflect aspiration or contusion.
Right cerebellar hemisphere hemorrhagic contusion versus parenchymal hemorrhage, associated with a right posterior occipital bone fracture.
Asymmetry and loss of ambient cisterns, and compression of the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle are concerning for upward transtentorial herniation.
Diffuse cerebral and possibly cerebellar edema.
Extensive bilateral facial bone fractures as detailed above, and as further evaluated on the concurrently obtained facial bone CT. Pl.
Aerosolized fluid and hemorrhage within the right maxillary sinus and sphenoid sinus.
Fluid within the left external auditory canal and scattered mastoid air cells on the left are concerning for skull base fractures, although none is definitively identified.
Left frontal scalp hematoma with subcutaneous air, but no evidence of retained foreign body.
Given the numerous fractures, any other associated fractures can be present but less obvious.
The above described ossific focus at the antero-superior aspect of C7 is associated with sclerosis of the adjacent portion of the body of C7 and mild depression of the superior end-plate of C7.
while this can relate to chronic changes given the sclerosis, associated acute component cannot be excluded and MR can be helpful to assess for edema/injury.
There is subdural hemorrhage at the level of the foramen magnum and upper cervical spine.
Extensive bilateral facial bone fractures with large midline laceration, without evidence of retained foreign body.
Left-sided fractures involve the anterior, medial and lateral maxillary sinus walls, the medial orbital wall and bilateral pterygoid processes, as well as the left frontal bone, frontal air cells and ethmoid air cells, the latter predisposes to CSF leak.
Right-sided fractures involving the posterolateral maxillary sinus, sphenoid and ethmoid air cells, frontal bone, as well as likely inferior orbital wall and apex fracture.
Non-displaced fracture extends through the right skull base.
Areas of subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage are noted, essentially stable since prior study.
More conspicuous right occipital small focus of SAH/parenchymal hemorrhage.
Irregularity of hypoplastic left vertebral artery raises the possibility of a superimposed dissection.
Decreased caliber of the left distal vertebral artery, as above.
[**2124-11-6**] XR Left Knee & Femur: No osseous or articular abnormalities detected in the left knee and left femur.
Right cerebellar hemorrhage more round in shape but similar size.
Somewhat more prominent right occipital hemorrhage which may be due to surrounding edema, slice selection, or slight increase in size.
Diffuse cerebral edema is difficult to assess; correlate with previously measured intracranial pressures, as study is unchanged.
Numerous facial fractures, better appreciated on previous dedicated CT of facial bones.
[**2124-11-6**] MRA Neck: Inadequate study for assessment of vertebral artery dissection, with no post-contrast or time-of-flight MRA imaging obtained.
No evidence of a fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine.
No MR evidence of ligamentous injury.
Degenerative changes at C6/7 disc space.
Partially imaged Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the visualized portion of the right cerebellum and right occipital lobe, with cerebellar tonsillar descent and crowding of the cervicomedullary junction, concerning for tonsillar herniation.
Evolving hemorrhagic contusion in the mid-inferior right cerebellar hemisphere with mass effect on the fourth ventricle, which appears patent.
Unchanged degree of cerebellar tonsillar herniation, which appears disproportionate and likely related to underlying Chiari I malformation.
Numerous facial fractures, as detailed on prior dedicated CT of facial bones.
This could be secondary to congenital hypoplasia but nonvisualization in the mid cervical region is with visualization of the lower and upper portions is unusual for a congenital hypoplasia and could be secondary to superimposed or occlusion in this segment of the vertebral artery.
Fat-suppressed images through the area would help for further assessment to exclude blood products from occlusion or dissection.
Mild changes of fibromuscular dysplasia are seen in the distal left internal carotid artery.
Brief Hospital Course: Imaging studies revealed the following injuries:  R cerebellar hemorrhage Lt pterygoid LeFort I fx Rt occipital fx b/l max sinus/orbital floor, Lt FNOE RUL asp, RML/LL contusion c7 corner fx, ant soft tissue swelling Rt [**9-10**] post rib fx R and L orbital fx comminuted nasal bone fx  The patient was admitted to the trauma surgery service and trauma SICU.
Neurosurgery was consulted for the hematoma in the region of the jugular foramen causing mass effect.
They felt that the location of the hematoma was not amenable to evacuation.
