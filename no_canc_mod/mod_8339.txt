with initial weight and lower extremity edema decreasing, but over the past three to four days, the patient has had increasing lower extremity edema.
Patient was feeling well until the night prior to admission when he was noted to have a non-productive cough over the past few days and awoke with severe dyspnea on the morning of admission.
The patient did vomit without hematemesis.
The patient took his Lasix and Zaroxolyn medication, however, in the Emergency Room he was also given an additional 80 mg intravenous of Lasix and 2.5 mg po Zaroxolyn, as well as his antihypertensive medicines.
He had a chest x-ray that was consistent with a pneumonia.
Congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram in [**2155-3-1**] with an ejection fraction of 35%, global hypokinesis, septal akinesis and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Diabetes type 1 diagnosed at age 18 months with retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, status post multiple laser surgeries, as well as bilateral vitrectomies, and chronic kidney disease.
Chronic kidney disease followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 805**] in Nephrology with plans underway to consider transplant versus Dialysis.
Severe hypertension.
[**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears diagnosed post hematemesis after severe gastroenteritis in [**2155-3-1**].
Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular regular rate, normal S1, S2, 2-3/6 small systolic murmur at the apex, no rub.
Lungs: Crackles at the bases bilaterally.
Extremities: Warm, [**1-2**]+ edema bilaterally lower extremities to the knees.
Neurological:  Appropriate, no asterixes.
Patient's respiratory failure was ascribed to volume overload with congestive heart failure, probably a combination of known decreased ejection fraction plus worsening renal failure.
In addition, the patient had a left lower lobe infiltrate on his chest x-ray and history of a dry cough.
Patient had a follow-up chest x-ray on [**4-9**] that showed marked resolution of his bibasilar pulmonary consolidations and congestive heart failure.
He had some residual small bilateral pleural effusions and small atelectasis at the left base, but resolution of the previously seen right lower lobe infiltrate.
Diabetes mellitus:  The patient was initially on an insulin drip without any clear evidence for diabetic ketoacidosis.
Subsequently, he had initially excellent glycemic control with blood sugars ranging from 54 to 209, however, on the next hospital day, the patient had an episode of hypoglycemia with a fingerstick of 16, as well as elevated blood sugars in the setting of a strict Humalog sliding scale and glargine while patient unable to tolerate a full diet and mild emesis.
Renal:  End stage kidney disease:  Patient had evidence of volume overload, but no acute indications for hemodialysis.
Subsequent to this, he had considerable pain that required multiple doses of intravenous morphine which was then switched to Percocet for his outpatient regimen.
Congestive heart failure secondary to volume overload and decreased ejection fraction.
End stage renal disease; to start perineal Dialysis in the next two weeks.
Percocet total of 8 tablets to be used prn abdominal discomfort from peritoneal dialysis catheter placement.
