History of Present Illness: Patient is a 57 year old female with past medical history of aortic valve replacement, hypertension, and hypothyroidism who presented to the emergency department with dizziness and fall after taking all of her daily medications at one time on the evening of [**2203-8-7**].
She reports she became dizzy and fell after taking her medications.
She does relate some episodes of chest pain several weeks ago and had seen cardiology for them.
A head CT was completed and negative for any acute process.
She was transferred to the MICU where she ws kept on dopamine and propofol while intubated, for a day, and successfully extubated on [**8-8**] without difficulty.
She has no specific complaints, aside from concerns about the stress that her hospitalization has created on her and her family.
She denies CP, SOB, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, or dizziness.
Mother, 73, deceased, had DM HTN.
Lungs: CTAB no RRW.
MMM, PERRL, no scleral icterus, no conjunctival pallor, no LAD or thyromegaly/thyroid nodules.
No gallops, rubs.
No ST-T wave changes.
An NG tube extends below the diaphragm and beyond the film, with its side-hole in the region of the gastric body and the gaseous distention of the stomach has resolved.
A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the region of the cavo-atrial junction with no supine evidence of pneumothorax.
There is patchy, streaky opacity involving the left lung mid-zone and base which may represent subsegmental atelectasis.
CT Head: [**2203-8-7**]: FINDINGS:  There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
There are no fractures.
There is extensive opacification within the nasopharynx and nasal cavity which is new.
There is mild mucosal thickening within the ethmoid air cells.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
New nasopharyngeal and nasal cavity opacification.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Biventircular systolic function and valvular function are similar.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 57 year old female with HTN, AVR, depression, and hypothyroidism presents with hypotension after taking all medications at one time, presents to floors after stay in MICU with intubation and pressors, now hemodynamically stable.
# Hypotension/Medication Ingestion: Given the acute onset of symptoms shortly after the patient reports she took "all of her pills," it is highly likely, as thought by the MICU and ED teams, that the patient suffered adverse consequences of taking too many blood pressure and sedating medications at once.
- TSH was checked while in the MICU, was found to be decreased (see discussion below).
- Her blood cultures were all negative, with the [**2203-8-9**] culture still pending at time of discharge--it was felt that sepsis was very unlikely.
- BP has slowly rose while off BP medications, and a few of her medications were re-introduced.
Given her cardiac history, it was desirable to get her beta-[**Month/Day/Year 7005**] and [**Last Name (un) **] restarted, so she was titrated back up to 100mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], and 40 of valsartan, with blood pressures remaining in the 100-120 systolic range--she was switched to Toprol XL for easier dosing at discharge.
# Depression- There was concern over whether medication overdose was intended, however, as noted above psych evaluated patient and felts it was a mistake.
It was felt she was safe to return home, as she denied and continued to deny any suicidal or homicidal ideations.
# ARF: Resolved, was likely secondary to volume depletion, as well as decreased renal perfusion secondary to low BP.
Patient did not appear hyperthyroid on exam and it was felt that an overdose of levothyroxine was unlikely to account for the low TSH.
# Nasopharyngeal opacification: Was most likely secondary to congestion or some sinusitis--patient had no symptoms during this stay.
# AVR: On coumadin for aortic valve replacement, INR Goal 2.5-3.5.
# Hyperlipidemia: Restarted atorvastatin.
# Safety/Discharge planning: - Physical therapy evaluated patient and felt she was safe to return home.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: -Hypotension Secondary Diagnoses: -Coronary Artery Disease -Hypothyroidism -s/p Aortic Valve replacement -Hypertension -Hyperlipidemia -Depression -Discoid lupus -PTDS -COPD -s/p TAH and b/l BOS -Hemolytic Anemia -Migraine -T9/T10 Disc Herniation   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted due to a fall and very low blood pressure.
You were monitored carefully, and a number of test were completed to ensure there were no other causes for your illness.
Please contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 665**], or go to the emergency room, if you experience fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, thoughts of harming yourself or others, or other concerning symptoms.
