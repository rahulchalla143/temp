He is a good candidate for a standard left temporal lobectomy, but he was worried previously about speech or language difficulties following surgery.
He has progressed with his refractory seizure picture and has reached a point where he feels that it would be better for him to undergo the surgery at this point, especially with the lack of benefit from the vagus nerve stimulator.
I went over the risks and benefits and details of this with him and we will plan a left temporal lobectomy with an amygdala hippocampectomy in the standard way  Past Medical History: Refractory temporal lobe epilepsy Depression Asthma Kidney stones s/p T11-T12 and L5-S1 spinal fusion  Social History: divorced, lives alone, no tobacco/etoh/drugs.
works as a speech & language therapist  Family History: There is no family history of epilepsy or febrile seizures.
no w/d to pain but has sensory in R side.
Hypodensity within the left inferior parietal and occipital lobes suggests edema; infarction cannot be excluded.
[**8-13**] EEG:This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of the presence of slowing broadly present broadly over the left hemisphere and loss of fast frequency predominantly in the mid-posterior temporal region on the left.
There were a few bursts of generalized slowing suggesting some deep midline compromise.
No interictal or sustained epileptic activity was seen.
Hypodensity in the left occipital lobe with cutoff of the left posterior cerebral artery just distal to the P1 segment.
These findings may reflect occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery with developing infarct in the occipital lobe.
Expected postoperative changes status post left temporal lobectomy, with slightly increased hemorrhage within the surgical cavity.
Acute infarct in the left occipital lobe and left thalamus as well as within the posterior limb of the internal capsule, corona radiata and insula.
The extent of findings is less than on the CT; CT findings may therefore reflect a combination of edema and post-operative swelling.
Expected postoperative findings of left temporal lobectomy, with hemorrhage within the operative bed.
Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction and hypodense left occipital lobe consistent with evolving, known left PCA infarct.
New moderate to severe left cerebral edema with effacement of the left lateral ventricle and new midline shift to the right by 7 mm.
[**8-14**] EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of asymmetric background with relative slowing over the left centro-temporal regions with loss of faster frequencies temporally suggestive of focal cortical dysfunction.
There are intermittent bursts of generalized slowing suggestive of some deep midline compromise.
No interictal or electrographic seizures are seen.
Interval enlargement of the large acute infarction in the left cerebral hemisphere, as detailed above, with increased mass effect and rightward shift of midline structures.
The temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle has slightly increased in size, likely due to increased compression of the third ventricle, concerning for impending trapping.
Small foci of hemorrhagic transformation in the left thalamus, and possibly also in the left occipital lobe.
Evolving left PCA infarction with increased hypodensity involving parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and thalamus.
Mixed density in the left occipital lobe may represent hemorrhagic conversion.
Quadrigeminal plate cistern remains patent  BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2167-8-22**] No evidence of DVT in either left or right lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was electively admitted and underwent a Left craniotomy and left temporal lobectomy.
Surgery was without complication.
He was extubated and upon awakening was noted to be aphasic and to have right hemiplegia.
The patient was reintubated [**8-13**] PM due to poor neurological exam and airway protection.
Repeat Head CT revealed L PCA infarct, new L edema with MLS & mass effect.
On [**9-19**], no changes were seen in patient.
Patient has low urine output and received 500cc bolus of NS.
Chest x-ray was done which revealed atelectasis and question of new L retrocardiac opacity.
On [**8-24**], patient reported abdominal pain in which GI was consulted for.
Dilaudid was also discontinued for fear of adverse reaction.
Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q4H:PRN pain, headache or fever 2.
Diazepam 5 mg PO Q6H:PRN muscle spasm, anxiety 8.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Refractory temporal lobe epilepsy Dysphasia Dysphagia Hemiplegia Esophagitis Back pain Depression   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Discharge Instructions: Craniotomy for Hemorrhage  ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
