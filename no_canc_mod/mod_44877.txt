IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
Featureless large bowel, which appears to have progressed since the [**2184-5-17**] CT examination, may reflect several entities such as chronic ischemia, excessive laxative use, radiation enteritis, or chronic inflammatory bowel disease or colitis.
There is no evidence of active ischemia.
14-mm CBD, not significantly changed in comparison to the prior CT examination, allowing for differences in technique.
Persistent mild prominence of the pancreatic duct.
CT SINUS W/ CONTRAST Study Date of [**2186-2-12**] 6:21 PM IMPRESSION: No masses, or fluid collections.
Likely air within a small vein secondary to artifact from contrast injection.
Although if there is pain at this site, this could represent the site of an infection.
No dental abscess.

Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 64 yo female with a PMH of ESRD on HD, Hep C, h/o polysubstance abuse, HTN, artificial hip who presented with abdominal pain, dizziness, and subjective fevers/chills in setting of missing 1 week of HD, having used cocaine the AM of admission, discovered to have FUSOBACTERIUM bacteremia.
# Fusobacterium bacteremia: Blood cultures turned positive for fusobactereium on [**2186-2-5**], but cleared with the most recent negative and final blood culture on [**2186-2-8**] on antibiotics.
A source of infection was not discovered; CT of sinuses and neck was unrevealing for a source of infection.
Heme/Onc was consulted, and did not feel that the patient met criteria for HITT antibody testing, and recommended that she continue using heparin products.
Her platelet count rose to 118 from 155 on day of discharge; Heme/Onc felt that her drop was likely secondary to a medication effect, which might coincide with her discontinuation of meropenem.
# Anemia: Patient has a known anemia with slight elevations in her MCV.
Anemia is udoubtedly additionally secondary to ESRD with poor formation of erythrocytes.
Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology, though consider that hypoglycemia could be secondary to prolonged sympathomimetic use, such as cocaine binge, which can cause hypoglycemia, or infection.
Patient had poor po intake recently in setting of nausea.
Unlikely to be medication effect and patient was not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics.
She may have impaired gluconeogenesis, though she is not in liver failure; impaired gluconeogenesis possible also in setting of renal failure and uremia, though patient does not appear to be uremic.
No obvious signs or sources of infection.
Pain control: Patient complains of pain around neck at the site of tunneled line, and some pain at the site of PICC.
We continued her pain regimen with Tramadol, Tylenol, and Ibuprofen.
Thigh/Hip pain: Was stable during hospitalization; patient was continued on her lidocaine patch, and PT cleared her for walking.
Patient had compliance issues with [**Date Range 2286**] at home, but our social worker has spoken to her about the number she needs to call to figure out which transportation service will be taking her to [**Date Range 2286**] on her [**Date Range 2286**] days, as opposed to simply waiting at home.
Abdominal pain: Improved during hospitalization with IVF and pain control.
We continued her PPI and pancreatic enzyme regimen, as well as a bowel regimen.
She also endorsed using alcohol for abdominal pain, but not does not find either problem[**Name (NI) 115**].
