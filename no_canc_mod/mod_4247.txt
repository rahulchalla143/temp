She regained consciousness when aroused but remained lethargic and confused.
Blood and urine cx were obtained and patient was given levaquin/CFTX for fever without a clear source of infection.
She then became hypotensive to SBPs of 60 despite 3-4L NS resuscitation and required levophed at 0.15 via a RIJ.

Admission Imaging: Head CT: No CT evidence of acute process.
If clinical suspicion for ischemic event is strong, MRI could be further performed.
CXR: Persistent elevation of left hemidiaphragm with mild adjacent atelectasis.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion .
EEG [**2119-5-7**]: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a slightly slow background which represents a mild encephalopathy.
Also noted were left temporal sharp transients but these were not definitively epileptiform in nature.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures seen .
No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic process.
No evidence of PE, as clinically questioned.
Two 5 mm lateral right middle lobe nodules, stable since [**2113**] consistent with granulomas 3.
Small, non-loculated left pleural effusion with atelectasis in the left lower lobe and lingula.
CXR [**2119-5-14**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-9**], there is little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
Continued low lung volumes with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
Mild atelectatic changes at the bases, especially on the left.
CXR [**2119-5-15**]: In comparison with the study of [**2119-5-14**] and [**2119-5-9**], there is no significant change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
Continued low lung volumes with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
Mild atelectatic changes at the bases, left greater than right.
Negative for new acute cardiopulmonary process.

Patient was transferred by EMS to [**Hospital1 18**], admitted to the MICU for CPAP and pressor support for two days, stabilized and transferred to the floor on [**2119-5-10**].
Patient developed leukocytosis [**Date range (1) 22666**] and was found to be C diff positive [**2119-5-15**] and received appropriate treatment with vanc/flagyl.
#)Acute parainfluenza on chronic respiratory distress with SIRS physiology: Initially presented with an unclear source of infection.
Presented with fevers, hypotension and hypoxia.
CXR showed mild pulmonary edema.
LP performed and CSF without signs of infection.
By HD#2, pt had acute episode of SOB treated with diuresis, nebulizer treatment, methylprednisolone, and CPAP.
Pt was persistently hypotensive, meeting SIRS criteria, with fever spikes on antibiotics and was placed on levophed for blood pressure support.
She had an CT abdomen and pelvis which was negative for any acute process.
Levophed switched to dopamine, which was initally  weaned off on HD2 but had to be restarted HD#3 due to a similar SOB episode as patient received IVF hydration before CT scan.
Respiratory status improved and able to wean pressors, but by AM became hypotensive again.
Placed on 60 mg hydrocortisone TID and her hypotension resolved.
Given her improving clinical appearance she was given a trial off steroids on the floor [**2119-5-11**], which she tolerated well so steroids were discontinued.
#) Clinical adrenal insufficiency: Patient's clinical response to steroids in the ICU initially raised concerns for adrenal insufficiency.
Patient was trialed off steroids on HD4, however and SBP remained >100 until patient developed hypotension with C diff infection [**2119-5-15**].
However, if patient develops hypotension in the future, she may require outpatient work-up of the pituitary-adrenal axis with cosyntropin stimulation testing.
She remained afebrile, AVSS, asymptomatic, with stable bibasilar crackles on exam no rhonchi, rales or evidence of consolidation, no diarrhea or urinary changes during this time.
PA and lateral CXR was obtained [**2119-5-14**] and repeated [**2119-5-15**] given patient's risk for superinfection and pulmonary edema however findings were unchanged from [**2119-5-9**] with low lung volumes and mild bibasilar atelectasis, negative for new acute process.
Patient was started on flagyl and PO vanc given concern of resistant infection in the context of recent ICU stay.
She remained afebrile but developed mild hypotension, tachycardia, and diarrhea overnight on [**2119-5-15**].
Nursing also noted increased fatigue but otherwise asymptomatic.
Patient remained euvolemic on exam (non-orthostatic, JVP 3-4cm, no edema, lung exam stable bibasilar crackles), Is and Os even.
Hence her hypotension was most likely due to a SIRS response to acute infection, possibly exacerbated by reflex tachycardia secondary to stopping beta blocker.
#) Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient with history of diastolic heart failure, on lasix and metoprolol at home.
CXR showed evidence of mild pulmonary edema in the presence of fluid administration.
Held diuresis and metoprolol initially given concern for sepsis, with PRN Lasix for clinical signs of pulmonary edema.
TTE was performed which showed suboptimal image quality, but mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with excellent global biventricular systolic function.
No definite valvular dysfunction suggested.
No pericardial effusion.
By HD#3, became persistently tachycardic without signs of pulmonary edema, dehydration, or pain.
No evidence of renal injury.
#) Dementia/altered mental status: Based on previous notes, patient likely near baseline with superimposed mild toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.
Has had slow cognitive decline.
Neurology was consulted for evaluation given her history of a fall in [**2118-10-10**] and her current presentation which involved loss of consciousness with loss of urine and mild rhabdomyolysis.
Neurology suggested EEG which showed slightly slow background representing a mild encephalopathy.
Also noted left temporal sharp transients equivocal not clearly epileptiform in nature.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures seen.
#) Long term care plan: Patient formerly lived independently; however she was having some difficulty completing her ADLs including toileting, ambulating and eating.
Neurologic evaluation and follow up: Neurology was consulted for evaluation given her history of one other fall in [**2118-10-10**] and her current presentation which involved loss of consciousness with loss of urine and mild rhabdomyolysis.
Neurology suggested EEG which showed slightly slow background representing a mild encephalopathy.
Also noted left temporal sharp transients equivocal not clearly epileptiform in nature.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures seen.
Kidney cyst - seen on CT scan, radiology recommends f/u ultrasound.
3. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
7. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: 5,000 units Injection three times a day: Heparin 5000 UNIT SC TID for DVT prophylaxis.
8. ipratropium bromide 0.06 % Spray, Non-Aerosol Sig: One (1) nebulized Nasal Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Leukocytosis  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: At baseline, articulate, pleasant, responds clearly and coherently to simple questions, short term memory poor.
At that time you were confused and short of breath with a fast heart rate and low blood pressure.
We found that you were sick with a virus called parainfluenza.
Before you were discharged, you developed an elevated white blood cell count, which can be a sign of infection.
We rechecked your blood, urine, stool, and chest xray to look for an infection and found an infection in the stool (C.difficile).
You were not found to have an infection in the urine or lungs.
