Admission Date:  [**2139-10-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2139-10-31**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-1-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  TRANS [**Doctor First Name 147**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old man who is status post a right upper extremity AV fistula three days prior to admission, who now presents with right upper extremity swelling.
This swelling is associated with significant pain of his right arm and the patient does report that prior to the surgery his arms were of similar caliber.
He denies fevers or chills, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.
Diabetes mellitus.
Peripheral vascular disease.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Right radius cephalic AV fistula in 06/[**2137**].
Right lobectomy for benign lung tumor in [**2085**].
Revision of the right upper extremity AV fistula three days prior to admission.
Abdomen is soft and obese.
His right upper extremity has severe edema.
There is no palpable thrill overlying the AV fistula.
An ultrasound in the Emergency Room showed a patent AV fistula and no deep venous thrombosis of the right upper extremity.
A renal consultation was obtained for hemodialysis and he was put on the Operating Room schedule for the next day.
After being consented, the patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**10-24**], where he tolerated a ligation of the AV fistula for venous hypertension without complication.
On a.m. rounds, he was saying his pain was much decreased.
The surgical sites were without any exudate or signs of infection and his tenderness in his right upper extremity was markedly decreased.
He was put on a monitor where he was noted to have pulseless electrical activity.
After being shocked several times, he went into a ventricular fibrillation and ultimately was stabilized with several doses of Atropine and several doses of epinephrine and then being put on a dopamine drip.
A right upper extremity ultrasound was also performed.
In the next few days, the following tests were performed:  A right upper extremity ultrasound which did not show any evidence of a deep venous thrombosis; a CT scan of the chest did not show any evidence of a pulmonary embolism, and a chest x-ray, although showing left heart failure and pulmonary edema, did not show any evidence of aspiration.
At this point, on [**10-26**], the situation was re-evaluated and the patient was still nonresponsive despite having minimal sedative doses on board.
An MRI of the head was obtained which, although did not show any acute infarction, showed evidence of chronic microvascular ischemia within the cerebellum and basal ganglion.
There was no improvement in his neurologic examination.
