Admission Date:  [**2193-6-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2193-6-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2118-3-15**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Acove  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old female with a history of mitral regurgitation, hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] Cardiology from [**Hospital6 33**] for cardiac catheterization after new onset atrial fibrillation, low ejection fraction and severe mitral regurgitation.
The patient presented to her primary care physician's office complaining of shortness of breath on [**2193-6-7**] when she was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate to the 150s.
The patient's anticoagulation was reversed and she underwent cardiac catheterization on [**6-17**] which showed no flow limiting disease in the coronary arteries.
She had moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with mitral valve prolapse, moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, normal biventricular diastolic function, heavy mitral annular calcification and an ejection fraction of 35%.
On [**6-19**], the patient was found to have a 10 point hematocrit drop with left lower quadrant abdominal pain.
Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed a large acute anterior abdominal wall hematoma extending from the left rectus abdominis muscle with extension within the retroperitoneal space bilaterally.
Throughout the day on [**6-19**], the patient had episodes of hypotension with systolic blood pressures into the 70s and was therefore transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
History of right breast cancer, status post lumpectomy T1 N0M0 status post radiation, axillary dissection; 5.
History of mitral annular calcification on an echocardiogram in [**2191**]; 8.
Note that prior echocardiogram also showed severe mitral valve prolapse with 3+ mitral regurgitation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  History of mitral regurgitation.
Cardiovascular, irregularly irregular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 present, Grade II/VI low pitched systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.
Jugulovenous pressure 8 to 9 cm, no carotid bruits.
Normal finger-to-nose and rapid alternating movements.
Electrocardiogram [**6-8**], atrial fibrillation with rate 100 beats/minute, diffuse T wave abnormalities.
Electrocardiogram [**6-13**], atrial fibrillation with left ventricular hypertrophy, nonspecific interventricular conduction delay, ST-T segment abnormalities consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy.
Echocardiogram [**2193-6-13**], severely depressed left ventricular systolic function with global hypokinesis.
Moderate to severe 3+ mitral regurgitation.
The patient experienced no further episodes of bleeding and maintained a stable hematocrit.
Cardiovascular - Her cardiac medications were optimized although she transiently did not receive beta blockers and Ace inhibitors secondary to low systolic blood pressures (approximately 100).
At the time of discharge her rhythm was atrial fibrillation which was rate-controlled.
Severe mitral regurgitation 2.
Severely depressed left ventricular systolic function 3.
Anterior abdominal wall hematoma  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
