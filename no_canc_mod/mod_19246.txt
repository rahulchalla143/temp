Mild diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Mildly dilated aortic root.
[**2159-8-31**] CHEST CTA INDICATION: 71-year-old female post-op day 4 from open AAA repair with persistent tachypnea, tachycardia and respiratory difficulty.
No pulmonary embolism.
Moderate-to-severe apical predominant centrilobular emphysema, with likely superimposed moderate pulmonary edema.
ARDS is considered less likely, as there is no patchy distribution of ground-glass opacity.
Other causes of pneumonitis are also less likely given rapid radiographic change.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
[**2159-9-2**] Chest XRAY INDICATION: AAA repair, with increasing WBC, shortness of breath.
FINDINGS: There is interval improvement in aeration of the lungs, suggesting improvement of pulmonary edema.
However, there are persistent changes consistent with pulmonary edema atop background emphysema.
Right-convex scoliosis of the lumbar spine is again noted with surgical skin staples seen over the mid abdomen.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Improved aeration of the lungs, suggesting improvement of CHF/pulmonary edema atop emphysema.

SHe agreed to have an elective surgery.
It was decided that she would undergo a Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with chronic contained rupture.
She tolerated the procedure well without any difficulty or complication.
When she was stabalized from the acute setting of post operative care, she was transfered to floor status.
Pt had episodes of hypoxia.
Pt received a pulmonary consult, her hypoxia was multifactoral / CHF / emphzema / Pt rled out for MI.
Pt did have a Echocardiagram  On DC she is requiring O2.
On the floor, she remained hemodynamically stable with his pain controlled.
She continues to make steady progress without any other incidents.
