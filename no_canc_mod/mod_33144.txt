The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Infusion of fluid through a left antecubital IV was visualized in the right atrium coming from the SVC but not from the coronary sinus, effectively ruling out a persistent left SVC.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe prolapse of the posterior leaflet, primarily affecting P2.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Several attempts were made to pass a coronary sinus catheter from the right internal jugular vein into the coronary sinus without success - likely due to inability to optimally visualize the coronary sinus.
The anterior leaflet moves well and coapts well with the posterior leaflet, which has been largely immobilized.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral stenosis.
There is some chordal systolic anterior motion but is not flow restricting.
Left ventricular function remains normal without wall motion abnormalities.
The aortic, tricuspid, and pulmonic valves appear unchanged from prior.
She required neo synephrine for a couple of days for BP support, but this weaned off and she was transferred to the floor.
The patient was bradycardic and tolerated only very low dose beta blockade.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
