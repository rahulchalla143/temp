Wet Read: [**Age over 90 20005**] WED [**2174-10-19**] 11:24 PM Acute left subdural hematoma measuring 1.5 cm maximal dimensions with leftward subfalcine herniation of 8 mm, downward transtentorial herniation with obliteration of the left suprasellar cistern, and uncal herniation.
No fx, destructive infiltrative lesion involving the skull base.
Final Report HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with subdural hematoma from outside hospital, evaluate for progression of bleed.
FINDINGS: There is a subdural hematoma overlying the left cerebral hemisphere measuring 1.3 cm in maximal dimensions, with hyperdense hemorrhage layering posteriorly.
There is associated sulcal effacement of the adjacent brain parenchyma with obliteration of the left lateral ventricle and rightward subfalcine herniation of 8 mm.
Downward transtentorial herniation and obliteration of the left suprasellar cistern as well as early left uncal herniation is seen.
High attenuation within the posterior aspect of the interhemispheric fissure may also represent a subdural collection.
No acute major vascular territorial infarction is identified.
There is a 1 cm subgaleal hematoma overlying the left frontal bone, without an associated fracture.
Again demonstrated is a diffuse permeative lytic abnormality involving the bones of the skull base, including the sphenoid and petrous apices, as well as involving the clivus.
The process again is noted to demonstrate cortical breakthrough, with an associated soft tissue component.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are otherwise normally aerated.
Acute left subdural hematoma, with associated rightward subfalcine herniation, downward transtentorial herniation, and uncal herniation.
Diffuse permeative and lytic abnormality involving the bones of the skull base, similar in appearance to prior study.
Taken to Metrowestwhere NCHCT preformed at 18:32 showed ~9mm L parietal SDH.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    to be perforemd at 6 AM - interval exam for increasing SDH, increasing midline    shift CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:    None.
Final Report HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old found unresponsive at nursing home, found to have a left subdural hematoma.
FINDINGS: A left subdural hematoma overlying the left cerebral hemisphere measures approximately 1.3 cm in maximal dimensions, is not significantly changed from study performed at 11:16 p.m.
There continues to be a rightward subfalcine herniation of approximately 9 mm, with likely transtentorial herniation, as the suprasellar cisterns are not clearly defined, as well as left uncal herniation as noted previously.
There is mass effect in the ipsilateral lateral ventricle, similar in appearance to prior study.
Additionally, subdural hematoma tracks along the interhemispheric fissure, similar in appearance from prior study.
There are scattered subcortical white matter low attenuation, which may reflect chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no definite evidence for an acute infarct.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
Again noted is a large subgaleal hematoma within the soft tissues overlying the left frontal bone.
No discrete fracture is identified.
Again noted is a diffuse permeative lytic abnormality involving the skull base.
IMPRESSION: No significant change in the acute left subdural hematoma, with associated rightward subfalcine herniation, as well as likely a downward transtentorial herniation and uncal herniation.
Provisional Findings Impression: SBNa FRI [**2174-10-21**] 9:15 PM Persistent left subdural hemorrhage.
No new hemorrhage.
HISTORY: Subdural hematoma, evaluate for hydrocephalus.
FINDINGS: A left subdural hematoma overlying the left cerebral hemisphere measures approximately 1.1 cm, not significantly changed.
Mass effect on the ipsilateral lateral ventricle is again identified and not significantly changed.
Subdural hematoma along the interhemispheric fissure is less prominent.
Scattered subcortical white matter hypoattenuation consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes are unchanged.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage.
A large subgaleal hematoma overlying the left frontal bone has decreased in size.
Extensive vascular calcifications are seen.
IMPRESSION: Persistent left subdural hematoma.
Interval decrease in rightward shift of midline structures.
No new areas of hemorrhage.

no hip films at Osh, please    r/o fx    Final Report HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female, has head bleed and ecchymosis on the left hip.
AP PELVIS AND TWO VIEWS OF EACH HIP: No fracture or dislocation is identified.
There are mild degenerative changes, with loss of joint space and marginal osteophytes.
An enchondroma within the left intertrochanteric femur is again demonstrated.
Limited views of the sacroiliac joints and symphysis pubis appear grossly unremarkable.
Degenerative changes are present in the visualized lower lumbar spine.
A vascular stent projects medial to the right femur.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute bony injury.
It is noted that there is a lytic lesion at the skull base on CT - when she is seen in the office for follow up in 2 weeks she will have and MRI of the brain wiht and without contrast per dr [**First Name (STitle) **] for further eval.
