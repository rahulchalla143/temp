History of Present Illness: This 75-year-old lady has a history of well-differentiated node-positive gastric cancer with a distal gastrectomy performed about 2 years ago.
She has a history of gastrojejunal ulcer disease as well, with a significant ulcer this summer that apparently had cleared on endoscopy.
She currently comes back with biliary obstruction and at the request of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was asked to get involved with her care when, after an endoscopy 2 days prior to this procedure, she developed evidence of free air on a CAT scan.
Therefore the biliary obstruction remained and a follow-up CAT scan was performed for some abdominal pain and this revealed isolated free air in the area of the left upper quadrant with a mass effect in around the stomach on an noncontrast CT.
There was no evidence of any large masses or distant metastasis.
There was central bile duct obstruction and gallbladder distension but no evidence of intrahepatic distention of her bile duct.
A CT was obtained on day 9 which showed high-grade obstruction.
On day of discharge, she has been afebrile with normal vitals, ambulating with help, while producing good urine output.
If signs of infections such as purulent discharge from wound, increased pain and redness around wound, please call or go to the emergency room.
[**Month (only) 116**] take quick showers but no baths.
