In MICU, interrogation of ICD showed no VT or VF but multiple episodes of NSVT.
He was started on hydrocortisone/fludrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.
Pt was evaluated for retroperitoneal hematoma/femoral hematoma w/ femoral US/Abd CT which and showed femoral hematoma.
He received 3 units of PRBCs for decreased HCT and femoral hematoma.
[**12-26**] during HD treatment, pt developed VT w/ recurrent ICD shocks, rhythm converted to VF, received lidocaine and amiodarone boluses, ICD was reprogrammed.
While in the CCU pt had further episodes of VT and so antiarrhythmic regimen was changed.
Patient became hypotensive in am of [**2130-12-30**] felt to be septic secondary to line sepsis from femoral cath.
The patient became more hypotensive and expired on [**2130-12-31**].
