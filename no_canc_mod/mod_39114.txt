Mild wall thickening of the colon, while may in part relate to underdistension, however in conjunction with hyperemia, raises concern for colitis, particularly involving the transverse and descending colons and possibly the rectum.
Bibasilar atelectasis, less likely infection.
Aortic atherosclerotic changes, without aneurysmal dilatation.
CXR [**2175-7-10**] IMPRESSION: Bibasilar patchy interstitial opacities.
Differential includes infection, pulmonary edema or atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, dementia, symptomatic bradycardia presenting with syncopal event, colitis, hypotension.
Patient was admitted to the MICU given heart rate abnormalities (tachycardia) and h/o hypotension (reportedly to the 50s systolic).
Her abdominal pain was treated first with narcotics in the ED which made her confused, and as such she was instead started on standing tylenol which worked well for her pain.
Hypotension: Pt has multiple possible causes of her hypotension.
Notably, she does seem to have a colitis on CT abdomen/pelvis, which is read as most likely being infectious in etiology.
Also, given the patient's c/o abdominal pain after the syncopal episode, this seems to be the most likely focal si/sx to be concerned about.
Notably, the patient does have atrial fibrillation with RVR, which can both cause hypotension, and also cause syncopal episode (see below).
Also, it can cause a clot to go to the bowel to cause an ischemic colitis type picture, however as above, unlikely given CT read.
Ultimately, from infectious etiologies, either the pain of the colitis could have caused a vasovagal type picture, or a sepsis like picture is possible as well.
Finally, no rate control was used for Afib given h/o symptomatic bradycardia (notably, she converted back to SR on HD2).
No c-diff sent given no diarrhea.
Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not on chronic rate control.
Based on history of bradyarrythmias, likely also has element of tachy-brady syndrome.
Trigger for atrial fibrillation currently infection/dehydration.
As above, no rate control agents were used given h/o symptomatic bradycardia, and rather IVF brought her rate down.
Colitis: CT scan showing evidence of inflammatory colitis.
Unlikely to be ischemic colitis based on CT scan read and patient's symptoms, lactate 2.0.
Bowel wall edema seems to be localized to the transverse and descending colon.
As above, pain controlled with tylenol.
Syncope: Patient has history of syncope secondary to bradycardia.
Likely has a component of tachy-brady syndrome secondary to old/poor conduction system.
Episode for presentation thought to be likely vasovagal in the setting of abdominal pain.
Also, given afib, do consider conversion pause as a possible cause of syncope.
Infectious causes are possible exacerbating causes of syncope, and as such we will continue abx therapy as above.
Chronic Kidney Failure: Baseline Cr 1.3-1.7 based on records.
Has chronic renal insufficiency.
[**Month (only) 116**] be slight acute worsening secondary to infectious process and dehydration.
# AMS: Pt has severe dementia at baseline.
As per family, seroquel (half tab) is the drug of choice for acute agitation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day): hold for loose stools.
6. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 15333**] Facility  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Infectious Colitis  SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Syncope Dementia Atrial Fibrillation  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with abdominal pain and an episode of fainting that we think is from your abdominal pain.
We found a possible infection in your intestines, so we started you on antibiotics.
