Her fevers, leukocytosis, and diarrhea did improve after starting Flagyl, and she finished a 14-day course of Flagyl three days prior to admission.
Evening prior to admission patient started having diarrhea, small amounts of brown stool initially soft and then liquidy; had three bouts of bowel movements yesterday prior to admission and day of admission had at least five bowel movements prior to coming to the Emergency Room.
She described diffuse [**6-18**] cramping abdominal pain that improved after each bowel movement.
Renal cell cancer status post partial nephrectomy in [**2156**].
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in [**2136**] for atypical ovarian cells in a biopsy.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
History of deep venous thrombosis; positive superficial femoral deep venous thrombosis in [**1-/2163**] admission.
Father with glomerular nephritis.
In general, she is a well appearing, elderly woman in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac; normal S1, S2; no murmurs.
Abdomen is soft; minimal bowel sounds; nondistended; diffusely mild tenderness to palpation.
Extremities:  No edema and warm.
Chest x-ray:  No infiltrate or effusion.
CT abdomen with basilar atelectasis, tract pleural effusions bilaterally, diffuse thickening of the large bowel beginning in the rectum incorporating the sigmoid as ascending, transverse, and descending colon, appendix was dilated to 9 mm with wall thickening, small amount of mesenteric inflammation in the cecal area, pancolonic wall thickening has increased since prior study.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 70-year-old woman with hypertension, history of renal cell cancer status post partial nephrectomy, status post recent admission with presumed Clostridium difficile colitis and Flagyl course who re-presented after completion of Flagyl course with occurrence of C. difficile colitis.
Sepsis:  Patient initially under sepsis protocol.
Patient was empirically started on broad-spectrum antibiotics under sepsis protocol, and these were eventually weaned down as her C. difficile toxin returned positive and patient was just continued on p.o.
Clostridium difficile colitis:  Patient with diffuse pancolitis on the CT consistent with positive stool studies.
Patient will follow up with Gastroenterology, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2643**], as an outpatient and because of recurrence of C. difficile colitis after recent completion of course.
Patient is to avoid lactose products for the next two to three weeks, as was advised, to help prevent recurrence of her diarrhea secondary to loss of absorptive ability.
The patient had a chest x-ray which was unchanged from previous one with no evidence of failure, just bilateral atelectasis at the bases.
Acute and chronic renal failure:  Patient's baseline creatinines ran 1.5 to 1.8 and after hydration under sepsis protocol, patient's creatinine returned to baseline and otherwise remained stable.
Deep venous thrombosis:  Patient with known right superficial femoral vein clot on last admission.
Otherwise, patient's deep venous thrombosis was stable and no other further issues.
Hypertension:  Patient had previously been on Cozaar and Dyazide on her previous admission but were held because of her acute renal failure and hypotension.
As her blood pressure started to elevate here and was otherwise stable and her acute renal failure resolved back to her baseline, patient was restarted on her Cozaar at low doses which can be titrated up as needed.
Her diuretics were still held with concern for hydrational status at present.
Gout:  This was stable and asymptomatic during this admission.
Clostridium difficile colitis.
Acute and chronic renal failure.
Deep venous thrombosis.
without difficulty.
