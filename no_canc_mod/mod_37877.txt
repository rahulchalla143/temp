Cardiovascular:  Patient has now known CAD, but did have a troponin leak and elevated CK-MB on admission in the setting of recent cocaine use.

He had no significant EKG changes.
He was initially treated with labetalol for heart rate and blood pressure control, but was changed to Lopressor on [**3-23**] and then back again to labetalol on [**3-26**] out of concerns for recurrent cocaine use.
No aspirin was given, given the patient's recent history of GI bleed.
Aside from the initial presentation of chest pain, the patient had no further recurrence of chest pain or other symptoms to suggest ischemia.
Respiratory:  Patient developed respiratory distress on hospital day two.
He was discovered to have tachypnea and ABGs done at that time showed hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Patient was started on a course of clindamycin and Levaquin for two days, but had no evidence of pneumonia on serial chest x-rays.
The reason for the respiratory failure was suspected to be aspiration pneumonitis given the clinical scenario and lack of infiltrates on his chest x-ray.
Substance abuse:  The patient had cocaine intoxication on presentation and has a long history of alcohol dependence.
He will require outpatient management of this chronic issue.
Patient was initially managed for withdrawal symptoms using the CIWA protocol, however, due to mental status issues, and then respiratory decompensation due to aspiration, he was weaned off of benzodiazepines, which were discontinued on [**3-21**].
Mental status changes:  Patient was unresponsive on admission secondary to substance use and benzodiazepine administration in the Emergency Department.

On presentation, he did have a 10-point hematocrit drop in the first 24 hours of his hospital stay.
He was evaluated by the GI service, who did an EGD that showed two gastric ulcers that were not actively bleeding and no evidence of varices.
In regard to his cirrhosis that was documented from abdominal ultrasound [**2119**], the patient does have evidence of chronic LFT elevation, but no coagulopathy.
He did have ongoing transaminitis and therefore a right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained on [**3-27**].
Patient was treated initially with lactulose during his hospital course, which was discontinued due to persistent diarrhea.
His poor swallow was likely secondary to intubation.
Chest pain with evidence of myocardial damage.
Aspiration pneumonitis.
