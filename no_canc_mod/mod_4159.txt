When seen in the ED, she was chest pain free and blood pressure was 150/77.
While returning she became diaphoretic and was noted to have SBP 270/140.
EKG revealed ST elevations in anterior precordial leads.
Echo performed showed no RV strain, and symmetric wall hypertrophy without focal motion abnormalities.
Also notable on admission was a Hct of 25 (pt has history of anemia (Fe def and CRI) with baseline Hct 26 - 28), and a Cr of 2.5 (baseline 1.7 - 2.0).
Pt was then admitted to CCU for hypertensive emergency given SBP 260s and ST elev V2-V4.
(baseline creatinine 1.0 - 1.5) 2) small hiatal hernia with severe GERD sx.
3) HTN: difficult to control, MRA [**2155**] with 1 out of 3 renal arteries with mod stenosis but not likely to cause renal insufficiency or sig HTN per rads report, urine metanephrines negative in the past 4) DM2 5) Osteoporosis.
6) Vertebral fractures.
7) History of depression.
9) Hypercholesterolemia 10) Chronic constipation.

Her ACE I and [**Last Name (un) **] were initially held due to concerns about renal failure, but these meds were subsequently restarted.
Pt denied any dizziness or lightheadedness at this BP.
Given her EKG changes with hypertension, she will need a stress test in the near future, when her BP is better controlled.
2. acute on chronic renal failure: Pt's creatinine was noted on admission to be elevated above her baseline (1.7 - 2.0).
For evaluation of her chronic renal insufficiency, pt has had renal biopsy in the past consistent with diabetic nephropathy.
DM type 2: Glyburide and metformin held on admission given worsening creatinine clearance.
4. anemia: Pt has had chronic (microcytic) anemia with baseline Hct 24-28, and was anemic on admission with Hct 25.
Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has been on Procrit in the past as anemia is thought to be due to renal disease.
Iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease.
