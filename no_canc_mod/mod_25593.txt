A chest/abdominal CT showed possible pancreatitis changes but limited exam, with CBD at 7 cm, along with a hiatal hernia, and acute pulmonary abnormalities.
She subsequently had [**5-1**] blood cultures with gram negative bacilli and some gram positive cocci.
On the day of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], her LFTs and amylase/lipase rose dramatically.
