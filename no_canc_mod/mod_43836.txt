Admission Date:  [**2162-2-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2162-2-20**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M  Service:  [**Company 191**]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year old white male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, quadriplegia secondary to cervical spine abscess and hepatitis C, who presents from [**Hospital3 4339**] after three days of change in mental status.
The patient was transferred to the SICU for management of severe hyponatremia.
Reportedly the patient has had decreasing serum sodium levels and had been placed on fluid restriction of 3000cc per day with which he has been very noncompliant.
For the three days prior to admission, the staff had noticed a progressive change in mental status until the day of admission when he was found very confused and lethargic with a garbled speech.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department where severe hyponatremia was verified.
The patient has no documented history of hypovolemia, diarrhea, syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone, hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Quadriplegia secondary to cervical spine cyst/abscess.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
History of urinary tract infection.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father has type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Brimonidine Ophthalmic Solution.
The neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention.
The heart examination was regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
A pump in the left lower quadrant.
Extremities - decreased muscle tone.
Feet were contracted, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Rectal examination - four large deep crater decubitus ulcers which appeared to probe to bone.
Neurologically, the patient moves upper extremities, minimal lower extremity movement.
Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with normal axis, nonspecific conduction delay, no ST changes, no T wave inversion.
From a fluid and electrolyte standpoint, the patient presented with severe hyponatremia with a serum osmolality of 220 and a urine osmolality of 409.
His dry mucous membranes suggested an element of hypovolemia as well, however, his blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio did not suggest significant volume depletion.
His elevated urine osmolality suggested syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.
Possible etiologies considered were hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency.
Gastrointestinal losses of hypovolemia such as diarrhea and vomiting were considered less likely.
Given the severity of his low sodium and his mental status changes, the patient was treated with hypertonic saline with subsequent increase in his serum sodium from 98 on admission to 104 by hospital day number one.
His sodium continue to improve and the hypertonic saline was discontinued and the patient was later started on a one to 1.5 liter fluid restriction with continued resolution of his hyponatremia.
The recent addition of Celexa to his medical regimen was felt to be possible cause of his syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.
Cardiovascular - On the evening of [**2162-2-14**], the patient became progressively more somnolent and began breathing more agonally.
Arterial blood gas was done which showed progressive hypercarbia and the patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
After intubation, the patient became hypotensive requiring the addition of Levophed for a systolic blood pressure in the 60s.
The etiology of the hypotension was not entirely clear, however, given that he also was febrile at the time a distributive etiology perhaps sepsis was felt to be the cause.
His fever workup included blood cultures one out of four positive for gram positive cocci and enterococcus with greater than 100,000 colonies, however, with a urinalysis which showed no nitrites and no leukocyte esterase raising suspicion for colonization of the suprapubic catheter without active infection.
The patient was, however, continued to be treated with Levofloxacin and Vancomycin was later discontinued as his fever curve trended down and the identification of the organism from the blood culture was coagulase negative Staphylococcus which was felt to be a contaminant.
Renal - The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Neurologic - From a neurologic standpoint, the patient has a history of quadriplegia and came in with a Baclofen pump.
Infectious disease - As previously stated, septic shock was considered to be possible cause of the patient's hypotension which did require pressors.
Chest x-ray showed multifocal opacities which was suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
As previously stated, he also was noted to have an Enterococcus urinary tract infection which was sensitive to Levofloxacin.
Hyponatremia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Enterococcal urinary tract infection.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
