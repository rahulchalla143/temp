Immediately following the impact, the patient noted immediate loss of motor and sensory function in his bilateral lower extremities.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's only known past medical history is that of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation with no evidence of obvious head trauma.
Rectal:  He was noted to have no rectal tone.
He was noted to have no movement or sensation in his bilateral lower extremities.
The patient was immediately taken for CT scan of his head which revealed no acute injury and no bleed.
MRI of the cervical spine showed findings consistent with that of his CT scan along with significant cord damage in that area.
Over the next few days, the patient's steroid drip was weaned off, and plans were made for neurosurgical open reduction and internal fixation stabilization of his cervical and thoracic spine.
On [**2180-1-2**], the patient was hemodynamically stable and taken to the Operating Room by the Neurosurgical Service where a C7 vertebrectomy was performed, a C6-T1 anterior arthrodesis infusion was performed along with ............... interbody titanium surgical .............. cage was placed which was packed with vertebral autograft.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications.
The Orthopedic surgeons had addressed his orthopedic fractures which included a left wrist fracture and right ankle fracture which were splinted.
The patient was also found to have a right lower lobe pneumonia with spiking fevers for which antibiotics were started.
Although initially in the Trauma Bay the patient was noted to have no sensation in his bilateral lower extremities and decreased movement of his upper extremities, over the following few days in the Intensive Care Unit, he began to move his upper extremities significantly more and began to become sensate; however, no function appeared to return to his lower extremities.
His Intensive Care Unit course at this time remained complicated by several episodes of ventilator associated pneumonia intermittently requiring pressors.
The patient's Intensive Care Unit course continued to be complicated by multiple episodes of ventilator associated pneumonia and central line sepsis.
Because of the multiple episodes of line sepsis and problems with central access for this patient, a PICC line was placed; however, the patient also had spiking fevers following this, and this PICC line was removed.
Following several attempts at weaning and failures requiring increased pressure support, on [**2180-1-11**], the patient underwent bedside percutaneous tracheostomy and bronchoscopy to verify placement.
He tolerated this procedure well without complication.
The patient underwent speech and swallow study which revealed that his swallowing mechanism was intact.
Due to continued spiking temperatures, the patient underwent a cardiac echocardiogram which revealed no evidence of valve vegetation.
Although the patient had passed speech and swallow study, he still had copious secretions and was deemed unsafe to begin p.o.
For this reason, he underwent an additional bronchoscopy which revealed secretions but non-occluded airway.
He began to slowly wean from the standpoint of his requirement for pressure support.
On [**2180-1-24**], the patient remained afebrile with stable vitals signs.
On exam he was awake, alert, and oriented times three, and was in no distress.
He was in a cervical collar without spinal tenderness.
Pulmonary exam showed coarse breath sounds bilaterally but was oxygenating well, and he was in no distress.
Extremities were edematous but warm and dry with triphasic Doppler signals and bilateral dorsalis pedis posterior tibial   pulses.
He has no invasive central venous monitoring and no arterial monitoring.
