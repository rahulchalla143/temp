CTA CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS ON [**2174-5-12**]  FINDINGS: There is an intimal flap seen within the aortic arch originating at the level of the right common carotid artery and crossing the ostia of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries extending through the thoracic aorta through the abdomen beyond the bifurcation into the external iliac vessels.
Thrombus is seen within both external iliac vessels, extending minimally into the left common femoral artery.
The true lumen supplies both hypogastric arteries as well as the left renal artery and a portion of the celiac trunk and SMA.
The phase of contrast administration is very early, and there is poor enhancement of both kidneys, but no differential enhancement is evident.
Bibasilar consolidation is seen, possibly due to aspiration.
Liver reveals no abnormalities on early arterial phase imaging.
There is no ascites.
No bowel wall thickening.
Type A aortic dissection originating at the level of the right common carotid and extending to the bilateral external iliac arteries, with thrombus seen within these vessels.
There is likely hypoperfusion of the right kidney which is supplied by the false lumen; however, early arterial phase imaging precludes evaluation of the renal parenchyma.
Bibasilar pulmonary consolidations.
Gadolinium could not be administered due to low EGFR.
[**2174-5-12**] SCHED CHEST (PA & LAT) Final Report FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest radiographs are reviewed without comparison.
Thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous, but also unchanged.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
Left atrial abnormality.
Non-specific T wave inversions in leads I, aVL and V4-V6.
Minimal ST segment depression in lead V6.
ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific but might be related to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2173-8-14**] upward bowing of ST segment elevations in lead V2-V4 is no longer present.
Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2174-5-12**] Conclusions No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level, which is likely within normal limits for the patient's size.
A mobile density is seen in the distal aortic arch consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection; there is no dissection or significant enlargement of the ascending aorta.
A linear density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: [**Location (un) 11916**] type B (Debakey type III) aortic dissection originating at the level of the distal aortic arch with propagation into the descending thoracic aorta.
No evidence of ascending aortic enlargement or aortic rupture.
No aortic regurgitation or pericardial effusion.
No significant valvular disease.
T-SPINE; L-SPINE (AP & LAT)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 61531**] FINDINGS: Two views of the thoracic spine and two views of the lumbar spine are reviewed without comparison.
There is no fracture.
Mild degenerative changes are seen in the lower lumbar spine, with degenerative loss of disc space height at L4-5, and moderate anterior osteophyte formation.
Small anterior osteophytes are seen at multiple levels in the thoracic spine.
Brief Hospital Course: 34M h/o severe hypertension and hypertension nephropathy, presenting to the ED on [**2174-5-12**] after experiencing an acute onset of mid-thoracic back pain while drinking a bottle of water.
The pain radiated down into his groin bilaterally, L>R, with subjective left leg numbness in his left heel, which resolved.
He denied HA, dizziness, or visual changes.
HIs exam was notable for slight TTP at T8-9, normal neuro exam, normal testicular exam with no hernia.
ECG demonstrated NSR at 87 bpm, notched p-waves (old), LVH (old), biphasic T-waves in lateral leads (new).
Back pain was difficult to control with 2 tabs percocet, 4mg IV morphine x 3 and 1mg IV dilaudid.
He was in acute on chronic renal failure with BUN/Cr of 32/2.9 from baseline creatinine 1.5.
Urinalysis was negative for infection, though with spot protein of 100, which is more than baseline.
CXR was clear, with no evidence of mediastinal widening.
Plain films of L- and T-spine unremarkable.
Decision made to avoid CTA to r/o aortic dissection due to compromised renal function.
MRI was attempted, but patient could not tolerate due to anxiety and discomfort.
Patient was admitted to MICU servcie for hypertension management and for TEE.
TEE showed Debakey type 2 Aortic dissection, involving aortic arch and extending all the way down to bifurcation.
No Ascending aortic involvement.
Normal LVF, no valvular problems, no pericardial effusion.
In the MICU BP control was difficult to attain, patient was intubated and sedated for better BP control and possible emmergent surgery.
HD2 [**5-13**] still with elevated BP remains on Esmolol and Nitro drips.
Given Morphine for pain control.
Pain med switched to Percocet and Valium.
There is likely hypoperfusion of the right kidney which is supplied by the false lumen; however, early arterial phase imaging precludes evaluation of the renal parenchyma.
Transfer to VICU deferred secondary to C/o testicular/groin pains- US abdomen/testicles- showed 2 x 2 mm hypoechoic lesion within the left testicle.
Renal following.
