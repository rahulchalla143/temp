Admission Date:  [**2116-1-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2116-2-3**]  Date of Birth:   [**2049-5-28**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old patient who was found to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm approximately one year ago.
The patient subsequently had a cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 3873**] which showed that she had significant coronary artery disease with an ejection fraction of 41% and an apical aneurysm.
She was referred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for peripheral angiography.
Peripheral angiography in [**2115-8-30**] showed a functionally occluded left internal carotid artery, distal intracranial right internal carotid artery aneurysm, and chronic total occlusion of the left subclavian artery.
In [**2115-10-30**], the patient had a ................. embolization of the right internal carotid artery aneurysm, and prior to her going for cardiac surgery, she had a redo cardiac catheterization which showed 70% left main, subtotally occluded left anterior descending, 60% ostial left circumflex, and totally occluded right coronary artery.
Left retinal artery stenosis.
Peripheral vascular disease status post left subclavian stenting.
History of fractured pelvis due to a motor vehicle collision.
HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**] and was taken to the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] on [**2116-1-28**], for coronary artery bypass grafting times two, with saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
The left internal mammary artery was deemed unusable in the operating room due to poor flow.
Over night, on postoperative day #1, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation and was started on Amiodarone and given extra beta-blockers.
On chest x-ray, on postoperative day #1, the patient was noted to have a right pneumothroax.
A pigtail catheter was inserted with complete resolution of the pneumothorax.
Vascular Surgery continued to follow the patient for her known abdominal aortic aneurysm and recommended obtaining a CTA with endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm protocol for evaluation of her abdominal aortic aneurysm, as well arterial ultrasound duplex of her lower extremities to rule out popliteal aneurysm.
On postoperative day #4, the patient had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation which converted to sinus rhythm with intravenous Lopressor.
Prior to discharge, the patient will have her CTA and ultrasound of her lower extremities.
Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
There was no erythema or drainage.
There was no erythema or drainage.
Coronary artery disease.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
Known abdominal aortic aneurysm.
