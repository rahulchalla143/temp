HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old male with type 2 diabetes and hypertension who presented after some chest discomfort on a flight from [**State 108**] on [**2160-10-1**].
His pain spontaneously resolve; however, on [**2160-10-13**], at approximately 8 p.m. he developed chest tightness which was [**9-12**] radiating to the right arm.
He had diaphoresis at this time.
No shortness of breath.
He subsequently presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] Emergency Department at approximately 9 a.m.  An electrocardiogram there showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 111 with left axis deviation minus 38, ST elevations in I, aVL, V2 through V5, the reciprocal changes of ST depression in III and aVF consistent with acute injury in anterolateral pattern.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Mother died of a myocardial infarction at unclear age.
It was difficult to assess jugular venous distention at that time, possibly up to the level of the jaw.
On cardiac examination he had a rapid rate with a regular rhythm, a 1/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, and a notable S3.
His pulses revealed right dorsalis pedis was 2, posterior tibialis was 1.
Left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis were 1 and palpable.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  At the time of admission the patient had laboratories from the outside hospital.
At the time of cardiac catheterization he was found to have a codominant system with his left circumflex having no significant disease, his right coronary artery which was codominant with the left circumflex had mild disease with 20% proximal middle and distal lesions.
His left anterior descending artery had a total proximal occlusion which received percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and a stent was placed.
Post myocardial infarction, the patient's creatine kinase peaked at 7746.
A cardiac echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 35% with a mildly dilated left atrium and right atrium, and moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anteroseptal, anterior and apical akinesis and hypokinesis.
Due to the low ejection fraction and apical akinesis, the decision was made to anticoagulate the patient.
The patient responded well to mild diuresis with intravenous Lasix, as he was found to be significantly volume overloaded after cardiac catheterization.
