Admission Date:  [**2167-7-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-7-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-11-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: CAD s/p cath for pain control and groin site mointoring  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac cath  History of Present Illness: 74 year-old M with DM2 and CAD s/p stent placement in [**12-29**] who presents from [**Hospital 191**] clinic with dyspnea and anginal equivalent, transferred to CCU s/p cardiac cath.
He has had symptoms of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and intermittent angina for 2   weeks, but refused ED evaluation last week.
Has significant history of b/t LE neuropathy.
Pt denies fever or chills.
+ nausea; no emesis, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p silent MI in [**2156**] (found to have 100% mid LAD stenosis), s/p NSTEMI in [**11-28**] -> staged percutaneous interventions of multivessel disease.
LAD long 90% lesion in the mid vessel.
Severe pulmonary HTN with a systolic PA pressure of 83 mmHg and a mean pressure of 53 mmHg.
s/p angioplasty of the left main/left circumflex stent and rotational atherectomy and stenting of the ostial right coronary with a drug- eluting stent.
pulm HTN chronic LE neuropathy chronic constipation h/o substance abuse - cocaine and EtOH h/o MRSA RLE abscess- [**2163**]   Social History: Pt is a married, retired banker working as [**University/College **] visiting scholar in finance.
Family History: CAD - mother s/p CABG DM - mother lung Ca - father and sister   Physical Exam: Admission PE: Vitals: T: 96.9 P: 76 BP: 123/49 RR: 18 SaO2:  98% on 4L General: Awake, alert, lying flat in NAD.
MMM, OP without lesions Neck: supple, no carotid bruits appreciated, 2+ carotid pulses b/t, unable to assess JVD (lying flat post cath) Pulm: lungs with faint crackles to bases, unable to sit-up due to post-cath exam Cardiac: RRR, distant S1/S2, no M/R/G appreciated Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, + BS.
Rectal: guaiac neg in ED Ext: 2+ R femoral pulse, soft, no hematoma.
No edema b/t, 1+ DP and PT pulses b/l.
The LMCA showed a 60% stenosis at the origin.
The LAD showed severe, diffuse stenoses up to 90% from the proximal segment to the distal segment.
The LCx showed a 90% proximal instent restenosis with diffuse stenoses of the OM1 and OM2 branches at 60-70%.
The RCA showed 40% instent restenosis with 30-50% stenoses in the mid- and distal segments, with a discrete 70% stenosis of a large posterolateral branch.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated severely elevated pulmonary artery pressures of 82/30, with moderately elevated mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 21mmHg and mean right atrial pressure of 17mmHg.
The gradient between diastolic pulmonary pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is suggestive of increased pulmonary vascular resistance.
The cardiac output was severely depressed at 1.7 L/min/m2.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LCX with a 3.5 x 16 Taxus DES which was deployed in the left main extending into the LCx and post dilated with a 4.5 balloon.
Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Distal anterior, distal septal, apical, distal inferior and distal lateral akinesis is present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2166-12-24**], there is no significant change.
CXR ([**2167-7-9**] and [**2167-7-10**]): Low lung volumes with no evidence of overt congestive heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo M with CAD, DM, CHF with EF 40-45% who presents with chest pain s/p cardiac cath, with pulm HTN.
* ischemia: significant h/o CAD as above, lipid panel in [**1-26**] showed TC 129, HDL 49, LDL 64, TG 79.  max trop at 1.10.
Echo showed no significant change from prior.
* pump: has history of CHF, with EF 40-45%.
elevated right-sided filling pressures and pulmonary hypertension was felt to possibly be related to elevated left-sided filling pressures or underlying pulmonary disease (hypoxic as well).
Digoxin was d/c'd as it was not clear why this medication was started given that he has not been overly symptomatic with heart failure symptoms.
As above, echo showed no significant changes from prior.
He was discharged on an increased dose of lasix to hopefully prevent future volume overload.
* rhythym - no active issues .
* hypoxia - likely from CHF, also history of smoking in past.
* neuropathy - not currently on pain meds and pt was not interested in pain medications of any type due to h/o substance abuse.
* anemia: Hct was seen to drop slightly during admission, but this was felt to be secondary to lab draws and small amount of blood loss during cath.
Coronary Artery Disease/NSTEMI, s/p catheterization 2.

Please call your doctor if you are experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills, or with any other concerning symptoms.
