No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
No pneumomediastinum is identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course: 36 year old man with a history of DM I complicated by severe gastroparesis and ESRD on HD admitted with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and hematemesis.
DKA likely caused by gastroparesis and non-use of novolog on the day of admission.
No evidence of infection on history or exam.
#Abdominal pain:  Patient admitted with 7 hours of sharp epigastric, non-radiating pain.
As pain is similar to previous presentations, it was likely caused by known severe gastroparesis.
Nausea and abdominal pain resolved in the ED with ativan, zofran, and reglan.
He was continued on home omeprazole to cover for peptic ulcer disease or gastritis.
Hematemesis likely due to [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear from continued vomiting.
Likely combination of Hematemesis and hemodilution secondary to IVF.
# Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Likely due to a combination of diabetic ketoacidosis, starvation ketoacidosis from lack of PO intake, and uremia.
# Hypertensive Urgency with orthostasis:  While patient says he routinely goes into hypertensive urgency with exacerbations of gastroparesis, his hypertensive urgency did not resolve with resolution of nausea and vomiting.
No headache, chest pain, shortness of breath or vision changes.
Patient had orthostatic hypotension of up 40mmHg difference from lying down to sitting likely secondary to autonomic dysfunction.
Chronic Issues: # ESRD on HD:  Chronic, on HD MWF.
Blood pressure medications have to be readjusted if hypertensive urgency is truly associated with gastroparesis.
