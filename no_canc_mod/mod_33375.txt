He was taken to [**Hospital 40576**] by EMS where he evidently had a GCS of 15, positive FAST, and hemorrhagic shock.
He evidently had a stapled repair of a cecal injury as well as ligation of the right iliac vein.
He also had a segmental loss of external iliac artery for which he had an external iliac to common femoral artery inter-position graft.
He was then transferred here due to blood bank depletion and need for critical care.
He had had approximately 30 units of packed cells, 2 units of platelets, 23 liters of crystalloid, and 6 units of plasma prior to arrival.
CXR from referring hospital demonstrates no pneumothorax or effusion by attending surgeon read.
Pertinent Results: [**2186-11-22**] CXR: FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**11-21**], there is probable progression of the diffuse bilateral alveolar opacifications presenting a bat-[**Doctor First Name 362**] pattern.
Although most consistent with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, the possibility of diffuse hemorrhage or even infection or ARDS must be considered.
[**2186-11-21**] XR PELVIS:  Tubing and a balloon device overlies the pelvis.
Although bony detail on this image is quite limited, no obvious fracture is identified.
At the periphery of these films, there are findings raising the question of increased density at the lung bases.
(see op note for detail) After leaving the operating room, Pt arrived to TSICU with tenuous blood pressure.
Right lower extremity fasciotomies were performed by the Vascular Surgery team.
