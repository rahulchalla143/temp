CXR revealed no PTX.
He received of gentamicin and was already on vancomycin for old pacer site infection.
In the CCU, the patient had an expanding hematoma on chest wall over the site of hte new pacer.
Postoperatively, his heart failure therapy was resumed and EP service continued to titrate his anti-arrhythmia regimen.
Operative cultures eventually showed no growth.
Due to some incisional discomfort, he was started on Dilaudid and Neurontin with good results.
