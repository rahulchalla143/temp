[**Male First Name (un) 4746**] w/PMH of paroxysmal AFib on warfarin, sinus node dysfunction s/p pacemaker, well-controlled DM 2, dyslipidemia, HTN, laryngeal CA, presenting as transfer from ICU after developing a likely hemorrhagic conversion of an ischemic CVA.
Pt initially developed a headache on Sunday night [**8-14**].
Vomited in ED 2 or 3 times and complained of severe right periorbital headache.
Neuro consult describes normal mental status except not opening eyes, hesitant but fluent speech, delay in following left-sided commands, dense L hemianopia, extinguishes to DSS on left face, L UE slight upward drift, good strength, no response to pinprick of left leg with marked extinction to DSS and impaired position sense.
Labs showed subtherapeutic digoxin level and subtherapeutic INR at 1.3.
Got one dose of methylprednisolone for possibility of temporal arteritis.
On transfer flight, pt complained of HA and received fentanyl 25 mcg.
Subsequently became unresponsive but only transiently.
EOM full except no downgaze, moves left side purposefully with full strength, [**3-14**] right arm strength with weak squeeze, right leg wiggles toes only.

Head CT w/o contrast [**2112-8-22**] Stable  EEG [**8-22**] This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
It showed a slow and encephalopathic background throughout the recording.
There were also very frequent blunted sharp waves, but there were no repetitive spikes or sharp waves, and there were no clearly epileptiform spike or sharp and slow wave complexes.
There were no electrographic seizures.
Head CT w/o contrast [**2112-8-24**]: Stable appearance of right MCA territory infarct with hemorrhagic conversion with slightly increased mass effect with effacement of the right lateral ventricle and increased size of the left lateral ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] is an 86 yo RHM with history of paroxysmal AFib on warfarin, sinus node dysfunction s/p pacemaker, well-controlled DM 2, dyslipidemia, HTN, laryngeal CA, who was transferred from OSH ICU after developing a hemorrhagic conversion of an ischemic infarct, with large fronto-temporal-parietal hemorrhage on head CT causing significant midline shift.
On exam [**8-16**], no eye opening to sternal rub, not following commands, PERRL (1.5-->1), + corneals, mild L facial droop, + cough, mild w/d of LUE to noxious stimuli; triple flexion to noxious stimuli in LLE.
Attempted to decrease cerebral edema with hypertonic saline.
EEG with no epileptiform activity.
Unfortunately, could not obtain MRI as patient has a pacemaker.
# Cardio: Hx of paroxysmal AFib and sinus node dysfunction.
#ID: Had an MSSA pneumonia (per sputum culture)which was treated with antibiotics that were discontinued once goals of care shifted to CMO as above.
