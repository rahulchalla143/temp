Her pancreatitis is attributed to a benign stricture of the ampulla of vater identified by MRCP.
Her course has been complicated by nutritional marasmus requiring preoperative TPN for several months.
Past Medical History: Peptic ulcer disease s/p Billroth II 20 years ago.
Nutritional marasmus requiring tpn.
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy fo the right upper extremity Emphysema  Social History: none  Family History: none  Physical Exam: Neuro:  awake, alert, in no apparent distress General:  cachectic HEENT: sunken temples Chest:  clear breath sounds; breathing easily at rest on nasal cannula Cor:  RRR with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Abd:  Open subcostal incision with fibrinous exudate at the base.
Moderate       amount of healthy appearing granulation tissue.
The patient's immediate postoperative progress was hampered by difficulty achieving adequate analgesia despite consultation with the Acute Pain Service.
This led to poor pulmonary toilet.
On POD #2 she had a temperature elevation to 102.3 as well as decreased oxygen saturation to 88%.
Additionally, a CXR showed evidence of pulmonary edema, basilar atelectasis, and possible pneumonia.
Diagnostic evaluation of her respiratory problems included CT angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism and cardiac ultrasound to r/o noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Both were negative however, changes consistent with emphysema (previously undiagnosed), were found on the chest ct.  Over the following week, the patient had a slow recovery of her pulmonary function through judicious diuresis and aggressive pulmonary toilet.
On POD #5, a wound infection was discovered that involved the entire skin incision.
By POD #11, Ms. [**Known lastname 51471**] displays a marked improvement overall though she still has a small oxygen requirement.
Her pain is well controlled, her wound is improving, and she is tolerating a regular diet supplemented by full strenght tube feeds through her jejunal tube.
