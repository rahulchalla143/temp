Admission Date:  [**2126-3-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2126-3-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2049-4-13**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 76 year old female who was referred to Dr. [**Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of critical aortic stenosis.
By report, the patient has experienced symptoms consistent with congestive heart failure since [**2119**].
An echocardiogram obtained at that time demonstrated a normal left ventricular chamber size with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and impaired relaxation with preserved systolic function and moderate aortic stenosis, with a mean gradient of 22 millimeters of Mercury and mild aortic insufficiency with trace to mild mitral regurgitation and a dilated left atrium and ascending aorta.
The patient underwent an exercise test in [**2119-12-30**] which demonstrated no evidence of ischemic changes and heart rate at 60% of predicted maximum at six minutes on [**Doctor First Name **] protocol.
A repeat echocardiogram obtained in [**2123-12-30**] demonstrated an aortic valve with a mean gradient of 26 millimeters of Mercury and two plus aortic insufficiency which did not appear significantly changed from her [**2121**] study.
Symptomatically, the patient described progressive weakness and diminishing endurance associated with shortness of breath.
The patient underwent cardiac consultation on [**2126-3-7**], which concluded a cardiac catheterization notable for moderate disease of the mid- left anterior descending with mild disease of the circumflex and right coronary arteries.
In addition, the study demonstrated a mildly dilated proximal ascending aorta with what appeared to be a trileaflet aortic valve with significant restriction of systolic opening along with two plus aortic insufficiency.
Diabetes mellitus.
History of transient ischemic attack.
Atrial fibrillation.
Degenerative joint disease.
Chronic swollen legs.
The patient's pericardium was left open, lines placed including arterial lines and a Swan-Ganz catheter; wires placed included both ventricular and atrial wires.
Tubes placed included a mediastinal and right pleural tubes.
Prior to transfer, the patient's chest tubes were removed without complication.
On postoperative day number two, the patient's Foley catheter was removed without complication and she was subsequently noted to be uneventfully productive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of her stay.
Evaluation by Physical Therapy suggested the patient was an adequate candidate for short term rehabilitation following discharge and the patient was subsequently screened by extended care facilities for post-discharge care.
Prolonged episode of atrial fibrillation with good rate control and no evidence of clinical compromise.
The patient was subsequently noted to be afebrile and stable with healing incisional wounds and no evidence of discomfort.
The patient may shower, but she is to pat-dry the incisions afterwards; no bathing or swimming.
The rehabilitation facility has been advised to be aware for prolonged QT intervals while the patient is dosed on amiodarone.
Should the patient continue to experience atrial fibrillation, it is recommended that she be begun on a Coumadin dosage schedule while at rehabilitation.
