Has been in nursing facility for several months  Family History: no fam h/o heart dz, although father died suddenly at age 37 due to "heart problems" possibly associated with service in WWI, no h/o  abnl clotting   Physical Exam: On Admission: .
Vitals: T:97.6 BP:96/58 P:61 R:16 O2: 100% 2L General: Alert, AAOx2 HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, poor inspiratory effort CV: Irregular rhythm, tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
Abd with mild tenderness.
CXR [**3-15**]: Findings consistent with congestive heart failure.
Right hilar opacity, concerning for pneumonia.
Recommend followup to resolution to exclude underlying mass.
There is interval increase in the bilateral pleural effusions, left side worse than right.
There is again seen some prominence of the interstitial markings consistent with fluid overload which is stable.
[**3-22**] KUB: No evidence of bowel obstruction.
[**3-24**] CXR: final read pending   Brief Hospital Course: 85 F with HTN, chronic systolic and diastolic HF, h/o PE admitted with PNA and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure- evidence of pneumonia on CXR, pt was treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin and zosyn and supportive care and respiratory status and oxygen sats initially improved with treatment, however then pt developed pleural effusions and increased work of breathing.
CHF exacerbation was thought to be less likely given that pt appeared clinically dry.
After discussion with the family and HCP, it was decided that the pt would not want to have thorocentesis and request was made for a focus on comfort.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR- has biatrial enlargement on past TTE.
Anticoagulation was held after discussion with the family out of concern for recurrent GI bleed and focus on comfort.
# Acute renal failure- improved with volume repletion .
# Delirium- likely due to PNA and afib RVR.
She initially improved with control of her afib and abx, however pleural effusions developed and the pt became less responsive and less interactive.
