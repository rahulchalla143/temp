Admission Date:  [**2113-11-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2113-11-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2069-3-16**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44-year-old gentleman with a history of alcohol abuse and alcohol-induced cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation, and upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs who was admitted to an outside hospital on [**2113-10-25**] with atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular response.
He subsequently developed facial edema and airway edema requiring emergent intubation for airway protection.
At [**Hospital1 69**], the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was significant for group G streptococcus sepsis; possibly from a cellulitic skin source which has been treated with ceftriaxone.
He developed hypotension and required a short course of Neo-Synephrine.
His atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response was eventually treated with digoxin with good rate control.
His Intensive Care Unit course was also notable for delta multiple sclerosis thought to be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy with a minimal response to rectal lactulose.
He also developed a left lung collapse secondary to mucous plugging.
The patient received bronchoscopy two times with aggressive suctioning on [**11-9**] and [**11-10**] with eventual re-expansion of his left lower lobe.
He failed a Speech and Swallow evaluation after he was extubated on [**2113-11-11**].
He was also noted to have some trouble with his cough and had a hoarse voice after extubation, thought to be residual from his angioedema.
Alcohol abuse with a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures and hallucinosis.
Atrial fibrillation.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed thought secondary to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use.
Chronic back pain.
Interatrial septal aneurysms.
Chronic deep venous thrombosis with collaterals.
ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN, DILTIAZEM, and ATIVAN are questioned for anaphylaxis.
He had some garbled speech and was nonsensical at times.
He had a hoarse voice.
The lungs had rhonchi bilaterally but greater on the right than on the left.
He had 1+ pedal edema and proximal muscle wasting.
He had some dilated veins of his upper thorax.
No interatrial septal defects.
Trace pericardial effusions.
No vegetations were seen on transesophageal echocardiogram.
On [**11-3**], a right upper quadrant ultrasound showed an echogenic liver consistent with cirrhosis and a hyperechoic lesion in the posterior right lobe.
There was small free fluid around the liver and some cholelithiasis.
No ductal dilatation or gallbladder wall thickening was seen on ultrasound.
A chest x-ray from [**11-12**] showed a patchy retrocardiac density and a slight increase in atelectasis.
On [**11-11**], an upper extremity ultrasound showed a chronic occlusion of right internal jugular with collateralization.
Acute thrombus about the brachial vein with normal flow through the second brachial vein.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  In brief, the patient is a 44-year-old gentleman with a history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, and a prolonged admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for alcohol withdrawal, complicated by anaphylaxis to possibly diltiazem versus Ativan or Protonix, and group B streptococcus sepsis.
He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and mucous plugging.
He had no further episodes of desaturations, and he was able to clear his secretions.
A chest x-ray on [**11-16**] showed interval improvement of the left lower lobe collapse and consolidation with clear lung fields.
DELTA MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have some delirium status post his Intensive Care Unit stay.
This continued to clear each day and was thought to be multifactorial with an element of hypoxia, hepatic encephalopathy, and alcohol-induced encephalopathy causing his change in mental status.
He had a head computed tomography that was negative for any acute bleed or mass; although there was note of a calcification in the left frontoparafalcine region measuring 6 mm in its greatest dimension which was thought to be related to angioma, although of unclear etiology.
He also was noted to have mild brain atrophy on a head computed tomography.
It appeared highly unlikely that the patient developed angioedema secondary to Ativan since he has received Ativan multiple times in the past without any adverse reactions.
PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient is now in a sinus rhythm; although, it appears that he is at high risk for having recurrent atrial fibrillation given that his left atrium was enlarged on an echocardiogram done at this institution.
CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has thrombocytopenia which was most likely due to cirrhosis and splenic sequestration.
He also had an elevated INR which was most likely due to liver failure.
The patient has a history of portal vein thrombosis which is currently stable.
From an ultrasound done on [**11-15**], there was no reversal of flow noted.
He was not longer at risk for aspiration.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Aspiration pneumonia and mucous plugging causing respiratory failure.
Anemia and thrombocytopenia secondary to cirrhosis and alcohol bone marrow suppression.
