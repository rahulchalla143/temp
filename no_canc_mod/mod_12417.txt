Admission Date:                   Discharge Date: [**2161-7-19**]   Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   The patient is an 82 year old female with a recent admission to [**Hospital6 1597**] for a GI bleed.
The patient denied chest pain or shortness of breath, complaining of abdominal pain for years but has felt increased pain over the last few weeks.
The patient was sent to be evaluated for left lower quadrant tenderness due to obstipation.
Recent barium enema 8 days ago (patient had KUB at nursing home rehab) demonstrating barium obstipation.
There was free air on the film.
It was decided that the patient needed to have urgent surgery and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] secondary to OR scheduling conflict.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CREST syndrome, history of upper GI bleed, and GERD.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was alert and oriented times three, in no acute distress.
Abdomen revealed right lower quadrant tenderness and guarding.
The patient also had gross fecal spillage in the abdomen.
She was also placed on Lopressor and her cardiac enzymes were cycled secondary to concern about a cardiac event from labs at the outside hospital.
The patient showed postoperative oliguria, which required bolusing to keep her urine output adequate.
On that day, the patient received an echocardiogram, which revealed a 60 percent ejection fraction, and slight right ventricular hypokinesis.
The patient did have an issue with atrial fibrillation postoperatively in the ICU initially and this was treated with Lopressor and magnesium with little effect.
The patient was, however, closely watched for acute changes and frequently blood gases were drawn as the patient suffered from CREST syndrome, which made monitoring by pulse oximetry difficult.
It was decided secondary to evaluating a chest x-ray that the patient was probably in mild pulmonary edema.
Over the course of the day, the patient was very closely followed, however at approximately 12:30 in the morning on [**2161-7-19**], the patient had an acute drop in her pO2 to 40 percent.
She became acutely hypotensive with a very low heart rate, which on EKG appeared to be a junctional rhythm.
Pulmonary edema was significantly worse though the ET tube was in place.
Due to the patient's failure to improve, the ICU attending on call was called to the bedside for assistance.
Cardiology was called and echocardiogram was performed at the bedside showing global left ventricular dysfunction and ejection fraction of 20 percent, right ventricular hypokinesis, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation.
This, however, was to no avail as the patient finally expired at approximately 5:00 am on [**2161-7-19**].
