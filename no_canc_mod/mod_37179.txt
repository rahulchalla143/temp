History of Present Illness: 87yo woman with HTN, Hyperlipidemia, CAD, recent ERCP with biliary stent placement aditted to the medicine servie [**5-9**] with UTI who now presents with acute onset left hemiparesis and left sided neglect.
Brief neurologic exam at that time was absent for any facial palsy.
At 3am the RN noted left sided weakness and called medicine resident to re-evalute.
Neurology Resident examination at this time revealed NIHSS of 13 for left arm > leg hemiparesis, profound left sided neglect/inattention, facial droop, slight dysarthria.
Pt was brought for STAT head CT/CTA/CT perfusion revealing proximal R ICA occlusion just prior to bifurcation with prolonged MTT on perfusion images in R MCA territory.
Neurosurgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] for possible IA intervention given that the pt was at ~5hrs since time last seen normal.
Unfortunately given the location of the ICA thrombus the risk of distal embolization causing total MCA occlusion with mechanical and IA TPA clot disruption was high.
At present, the patient denies any headache, she is unaware of her left sided deficit.

There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Large area of right MCA territory ischemia, without definite evidence of acute infarction on the included images.
However, small areas of acute infarction or infarction in areas in territories outside the included images cannot be assessed on the present study.
Large intraluminal filling defect, in the right distal common carotid, common carotid bifurcation, and proximal cervical internal carotid artery, as well as a tiny filling defect in the cavernous right internal carotid artery, related to thrombosis.
Mild stenosis, without flow-limiting stenosis or hemodynamically significant in the left common carotid, as well as at the cavernous internal carotid arteries  [**2142-5-9**] Cardiology ECG [**2142-5-11**] [**Last Name (LF) 162**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] Sinus bradycardia.
Peaked P waves with rightward P wave axis consistent with right atrial enlargement.
There is slight ST segment depression and T wave inversion in leads I and aVL, more prominent as compared with prior tracing of [**2142-4-22**].
Non-conducted atrial ectopy is no longer recorded.
No diagnostic interim change.
No acute intracranial process.
Likely chronic lacunar infarct in the left thalamus.
Please note that MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive for detection of acute brain ischemia  Brief Hospital Course: NEURO 87yo woman with HTN, Hyperlipidemia, CAD, recent ERCP with biliary stent placement aditted to the medicine service [**5-9**] with UTI who developed acute onset left hemiparesis and left sided neglect.
Her neurologic exam is notable for left hemiparesis, profound left sided neglect and anosognosia.
NCHCT negative, but CTA/perfusion with large R ICA thrombus and prolonged MTT in R MCA territory.
Mechanism was probably cardioembolic as she has atrial fibrillation and was not on heparin or coumadin and INR was sub therapeutic.
Admitted to the NeuroICU for with a large close observation of her neurological status.
* She neurologically completed her R MCA stroke, her hemiparesis became a diffuse grade 4 whereas at first it was strongly dependent on the level of neglect.
She continued to have a fluctuating mental status but often was alert.
CARDIO Her bloodpressures were stable without further interventions or changes in her bloodpressure medications.
She had intermittent Afib but did not go into RVR.
There were no signficant GI issues.
Afebrile throughout.
Neurologic examination notable for mild left hemiparesis and left hemineglect.
[**Hospital3 **] Instructions: You have been admitted with a large R sided stroke, with neurological deficits on the L side of your body.
Please report to the nearest ER or call 911 or your PCP immediately when you experience recurrence of weakness, numbness, tingling, problems with speech, language, walking, thinking, headache, or difficulties arousing, or any other signs or symptoms of concern.
