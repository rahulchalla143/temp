The patient received multiple fluid boluses due to decreased urine output.
Pleural fluid of the left effusion was removed on [**2111-1-11**] and was negative.

For the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the patient was continued on her nebs, her MDI and her Prednisone taper.
For the hepatic insufficiency, the hepatology team followed up in consult and stated that the patient likely had cirrhosis and wound not benefit further from a biopsy, especially given its risk.
