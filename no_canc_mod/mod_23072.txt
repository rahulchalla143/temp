He notes abdominal pain that started 3 days ago.
He reports [**Location (un) 2452**] colored urine over the past few days, but no [**Male First Name (un) 1658**] colored stools.
He denies any recent weight loss.
Past Medical History: PMH: HTN glaucoma HTN gout hypothyroidism    Social History: Lives with his son.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is discrete upper septal hypertrophy - coupled with the hyperdynamic LV systolic function, there is functional LVOT obstruction with a small gradient.
The degree of mitral regurgitation has increased slightly.
Unchanged mild enlargement of the right hilar structures, presumably due to vascular crowding.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity, no evidence of overhydration, no pneumothorax.
The sum of son[**Name (NI) 493**] and CT findings are concerning for acute cholecystitis.
No biliary dilatation.
Together with same-day son[**Name (NI) 493**] findings, CT findings are concerning for acute cholecystitis.
Pancreatic cyst and vague hypodense area are likely incidental findings.
These are incompletely evaluated and may be further assessed with IV contrast after resolution of acute symptoms.
Small hiatal hernia.
Bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.
Atherosclerotic disease with coronary artery disease.
One stone and sludge with a small amount of pus was retrieved from the biliary tree using a 12mm balloon (sphincterotomy, stone extraction) Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum  [**2189-8-4**] Cardiac echo: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild pancreatitis with likely beginning pseudocyst formation posterior to the body of the pancreas  2.
Cystic lesions in the head of the pancreas are likely incidental and may represent IPMN.
Acute cholecystitis with hyperemia of the adjacent liver parenchyma    Brief Hospital Course: 1.
Gallstone pancreatitis and Choledocholithiasis: Patient initially transferred from OSH with symptoms of biliary obstruction (elevated LFTs and total bilirubin of 9.4) and pancreatitis.
Patient underwent ERCP with spincterectomy and extraction of multiple stones on [**8-3**].
Abdominal pain improved and patient placed on clear diet which he tolerated well.
On [**8-9**], patient was taken back to the operating room for laproscopic cholecystectomy.
Postoperative course with numberous complications including acute on chronic renal failure, acute anemia, acute respiratory distress and rising WBC count (all outlined below).
Of note, on his initial abdominal CT a pancreatic cyst/mass was noted at the junction of the head and the body thus prompting a repeat abdominal CT with pancreatic protocol.
His repeat CT scan noted that the cyst was an incidenental finding and should be followed in 6 months with a repeat scan or MRI.
Labile HTN: Throughout hospital course, patient had labile HTN with systolic BP rising to as high as 180s- 200s, prompting multiple changes in BP management.
Postoperatively, patient was on verapamil only and had markedly elevated blood pressure to 170-180s on [**8-12**].
At this point, patient developed acute respiratory distress most likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema and was transferred to medical ICU.
Acute Respiratory Distress: On [**8-12**], patient was transferred from general surgery floor to MICU for worsening respiratory distress.
Patient was tachypnic to 40s with prominent wheeze and a new O2 requirement of 6L NC.
CXR showed increased interstitial pattern consistent with early pulmonary edema.
While patient has an extensive smoking history, he has no known history of COPD and labs were not consistent with chronic CO2 retention.
PE was considered to be unlikely given quick resolution of symptoms with treatment, and prior negative LENIs.
Nebulizer treatments were continued for symptomatic relief.
Dyspnea was thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of poorly controlled HTN and all antibiotics were stopped.
On [**8-15**], the patient did have an episode of dyspnea on the floor.
His CXR also showed increased fluid, and he was given IV lasix.
Leukocytosis: Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient had WBC of 24.5 with a neutrophil predominance of 92% secondary to cholecystitis and  gallstone pancreatitis.
After laproscopic cholecystectomy on [**8-9**], WBC count again rose to the 20s although patient remained afebrile and without focal symptoms of infection.
Leukocytosis was felt to be an acute response to recent stress.
When patient transferred to MICU on [**8-12**] for respiratory distress, there was initial concern for PNA given prolonged hospital course and recent intubation.
He remained afebrile with WBC 9.6 at discharge.
Patient became agitated multiple nights, pulling at IV and foley (causing foley trauma with [**Known firstname **] hematuria), requiring halidol for behavioral control.
Other sources of delerium  including toxic- metabolic syndrome (med effects, electrolyte imbalance, myxedema, etc), recent surgery, ICU psychosis.
Infection as etiology was also considered esp in setting of leukocytosis and patient had multiple blood cultures, urine cultures, CXR, etc.
Diastolic CHF: Patient with history of diastolic CHF that contributed to complications of postoperative course, chiefly acute respiratory distress from pulmonary edema.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled several times during postoperative course, and always remained negative, indicating no acute coronary syndrome.
Echo was performed on [**8-13**], showing function LVOT with a small gradient, slightly increased mitral regurgitation, and increased pulmonary artery systolic pressures.
7. chronic kidney disease: Creatinine has been stably elevated during admission, with baseline ~2.0, and consistent proteinuria on urinalysis.
Creatinine did increase to 2.4 on [**8-7**] likely from CT scan with acute dye load, but returned quickly to baseline with hydration.
After his foley catheter was removed, the patient did have some elevated post-void residuals.
Hypothyroidism: While on the floor, the patient was showing some psychomotor slowing.
History of gout: Allopurinol was held given recent acute rise in creatinine above baseline elevation.
Will plan to restart if creatinine remains stable, or resume as outpatient.
Medications on Admission: Allopurinol 100mg daily .Cosopt [**Hospital1 **] .HCTZ 25mg daily .Lisinopril 40mg daily .Verapamil SR 240mg daily .Xalatan 0.005% .Synthroid 12.5mcg daily   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: gallstone pancreatitis   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the Emergency Department for any of the following:  *You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.

*Your pain in not improving within 8-12 hours or is not gone within 24 hours.
Call or return immediately if your pain is getting worse or changes location or moving to your chest or back.
*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
*Any change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you.
Incision Care:  *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
