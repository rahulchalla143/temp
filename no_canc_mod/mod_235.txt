Pt complained of increased SOB after dialysis and was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring of respiratory status.
CXR was consistent with CHF and ECG showed signs of mild ST depression in I, aVL and poor R wave progression.
Pt ruled in for NSTEMI with CK peak of 207 and trop peak of 2.22 while in the MICU.

There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
At least moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Drop in echocardiolographic ejection fraction in the setting of elevated cardiac troponin levels.
Elevated right-sided filling pressure.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant system with three vessel coronary disease.
The LMCA had a 40% ostial stenosis with damping.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right-sided filling pressures (PCWP mean 28 mmHg), borderline pulmonary hypertension (PA mean 40 mmHg) 3.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial LAD with a 2.5 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent, which was post-dilated to 3.0 mm."
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 67yo female with CAD s/p MI, DMII with ESRD presents with acute onset SOB after dialysis who ruled in for NSTEMI with CK peak of 207 and troponin peak of 2.22.
SOB: The patient received a portable Echo in the MICU which showed new changes with "moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls" and an EF of 30%.
The patient was brought to the cath lab on [**2196-10-7**] where the patient was shown to have three vessel coronary artery disease with elevated right-sided filling pressure.
On the floor, the patient was monitored on telemetry for 48 hours without incident.
The patient was without complaints and hemodynamically stable on discharge to the care of the son where she will live with the support of the daughter in law.
