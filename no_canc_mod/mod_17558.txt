This mother has a complicated medical history notable for a liver transplant in [**2173**] due to acute hepatitis B infection.
There was a recent biopsy suggestive of a component of autoimmune hepatitis.
The mother also has chronic hypertension and is maintained on nifedipine.
She also has chronic renal insufficiency.
Her obstetrical history is notable for a delivery at 27 weeks in [**2180**] with the pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia.
This pregnancy was complicated by development of hypertension, headaches and proteinuria initiating approximately 3 weeks prior to delivery.
At delivery the infant emerged depressed, limp, with poor tone and absent respiratory effort.
Initial heart rate was 60 to 80 beats per minute, increasing to over 100 with positive pressure ventilation.
Mild intercostal retractions.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, soft systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Small umbilical hernia.
She     initially weaned over the first 48 hors of life, but on     day of life number 3, was changed to the high frequency     ventilator due to worsening respiratory status.
Had a brief trial in nasal cannula oxygen day     15 to day 17 but was placed back on CPAP due to oxygen     saturation drifts and episodes of apnea and bradycardia.
She required 1.5 liters per minute     to attempts to wean from 1.5 to 1 liters were met with     increased oxygen desaturations and increased episodes of     apnea.
She was treated with caffeine     for apnea of premature.
She continues to have spontaneous     episodes of apnea and there is some speculation that she     may have some component of central apnea.
Her state screen     was positive for a DNA type consistent with cystic     fibrosis and she will need a sweat test as an     outpatient.
This baby required treatment for     profound hypotension from the time of birth with volume     expansion and dopamine.
She had     an echocardiogram performed on day of life number 2 that     showed mild mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid     regurgitation, no patent ductus arteriosus and a patent     foramen ovale.
She has a soft intermittent murmur noted     at the time of discharge.
Feeds have been well tolerated     except for presumed reflux that is being treated with     Reglan and Prilosec.
Due to her prematurity and condition     at birth, this baby was evaluated for sepsis upon     admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.
A     complete [**Year (4 digits) **] count was notable for a low absolute     neutrophil count.
She has     had 4 other episodes of suspicion for sepsis which were     treated with 48 hour courses of antibiotics.
All     cultures were no growth.
Serial lumbar punctures were     done for the evolving post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus and     all cultures were no growth.
She     was also treated for coagulopathy around the time of     birth with 4 platelet transfusions, 1 fresh frozen     plasma transfusion and 1 cryoprecipitate transfusion.
This baby required treatment for     unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
A head ultrasound was obtained on day of     life number 1 and showed an extensive intraventricular     hemorrhage with large clot and ventricular dilatation.
An     ultrasound obtained on day of life number 17 showed     increased ventricular size with post-hemorrhagic     hydrocephalus and an evolving porencephalic cyst.
Subsequent ultrasound     showed decreased ventricular size which remained stable     through weekly ultrasounds.
Her most recent ultrasound     on [**2181-10-31**] showed sparse white matter with     increased extra-axial fluid and a cyst in the left     germinal matrix, persistence but retraction of the     intraventricular clot.
This infant has had multiple eye exam     screening for retinopathy of prematurity.
She     has never had any stage II disease.
All results within normal limits except for     the noted elevated thyroid stimulating hormone and low     T4 levels.
Also, DNA suggestion of potential     cystic fibrosis carrier status.
Chronic lung disease; 4.
Hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home care-givers.
Outpatient sweat test to rule out cystic fibrosis.
Prematurity at 27 weeks gestation.
Respiratory distress syndrome secondary to surfactant     deficiency.
Chronic lung disease.
Suspicion for sepsis ruled out X4.
Apnea of prematurity.
Intraventricular hemorrhage with parenchymal extension.
Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus.
14.Suspicion for cystic fibrosis disease or carrier state.
