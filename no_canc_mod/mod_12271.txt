Admission Date:  [**2145-6-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2145-6-29**]   Service:  MICU GREEN  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of severe coronary artery disease, multiple MIs, type 2 diabetes, congestive heart failure with an EF of less than 25%, who presented to [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital on [**2145-6-23**] with a pale cool right lower extremity.
She was found to have elevated CKs at that time and by arteriography to have an occlusion of her right femoral artery.
However, the patient subsequently was anticoagulated and developed a GI bleed with a hematocrit drop and transient hypotension.
Additionally, she had lines placed and had a new cell hematoma from a IJ and a groin hematoma at the site of the arterial access.
Coronary artery disease, status post MI times two in [**2142**], three vessel disease, not a candidate for CABG or PTCA, based on a catheterization in [**2143**], left main 70%, left circumflex 95%, LAD 80%, RCA 100%.
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine apparently 1.2 to 1.3.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
She is demented and has intermittent episodes of delirium but is able to carry on a coherent conversation at times.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, II/VI systolic murmur at the apex.
Extremities:  The right lower extremity had some firmness in the right calf and Dopplerable pulses and a DP and TP.
Neurologic:  She was lethargic but intermittently arousable and moving all extremities symmetrically.
EKG showed no ST depressions in V4 through V6.
Chest x-ray showed a hematoma in the left superior mediastinum and a U/A from the outside hospital showed moderate leukocyte esterase and 50-100 white blood cells.
The patient had an echocardiogram which showed small pericardial effusion near the right atrium, no clot, and an ejection fraction, mildly dilated LA, moderately to severely depressed EF of 30%, akinesis at the inferior and posterior walls, hypokinesis of the inferior septum wall, no masses or thrombi.
Mild thickening of the aortic leaflets but no stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, 1+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] tamponade.
Ischemia:  The patient had the ischemic right leg, as previously indicated with CTAs elevated to a peak of 12,000.
She underwent a successful thrombectomy with restoration of flow, the etiology of the thrombus was thought to be an embolic event, likely from the heart, although it was not seen on echocardiography.
The patient was initially treated with heparin which was to be continued after she had the GI bleed and the hematocrit dropped to 24.
In terms of cardiac ischemia, the patient had multiple troponins greater than 50, deemed likely from ischemia from demand given her low hematocrit, severe underlying coronary artery disease.
She was not deemed a candidate for cardiac catheterization and again the heparin was deemed too risky given the GI bleeds and the falling hematocrit.
In terms of her pump function, the patient showed no signs of congestive heart failure during the hospital stay and she was several liters positive without any drop in her oxygen.
The patient had several episodes of hypotension in the PACU after thrombectomy.
This was likely due to GI bleed and she had no further episodes of hypotension or any events during the stay.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had heme-positive stools and hematocrit dropped.
The etiology of the heme-positive stools was unknown.
The patient's stay was also notable for very small p.o.
The patient was also given Boost supplementations for a low albumin.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a positive U/A at an outside hospital.
She was treated with six days of levofloxacin and had no fevers and her white count remained normal during the hospital stay.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes.
PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient has a history of depression and was continued on her Sertraline.
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient has a history of dementia, questionable delirium and has apparently been bed bound and delirious at home.
The patient is apparently on home hospice care for her coronary artery disease and dementia at home.
No further intervention was taken for her neurologic status.
Urinary tract infection.
Poor nutritional status.
