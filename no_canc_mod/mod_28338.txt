History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year-old male with a history of CAD with prior MI and stent placement in [**2100**] who presents with bradycardia, chest pressure and a 10 second pause on telemetry.
Was in his USOH until 10pm today when ~1-2 minutes after getting up to grab a glass of milk felt lightheaded, mild nausea, and a sensation of emesis and pre-syncope.
No bowel/bladder incontinence or tongue biting.
He denies any presyncopal palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath.
He notes that on the way he noted some mild lower chest discomfort, worse with deep inspiration.
He is currently CP free, with no SOB, palpitations, LH, dizziness, or presyncope sensations.
Coronary artery disease: - s/p IMI with stent placement (unclear [**Name2 (NI) 12425**]) - s/p abnormal stress test and cath with stend placement (unclear [**Name2 (NI) 12425**])  Cardiac Risk Factors: (+) Dyslipidemia, (+) Hypertension, (-) Diabetes Cardiac History: CABG: none Percutaneous coronary intervention - [**12/2099**] in setting of AMI and [**8-/2100**] in setting of abnormal stress test: unknown vessels (done at [**Hospital 1559**] Medical) Pacemaker/ICD: none  2.
Hypertension 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No carotid bruits bilaterally.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Mild TTP over left flank to palpation; no CVA tenderness bilaterally.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There are no pneumothoraces identified.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspic regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Rhythm (complete heart block): Presented after having had syncopal events, with HR in 20s noted on occasion and complete heart block (~7 seconds with no ventricular activity) on another.
Prior history of an inferior MI, but no prior arrythmia/syncope.
Review of telemetry appears to be complete heart block with atrial activity and no conducted ventricular beats.
Coronary artery disease: Presented with a history of prior MI (inferior), on aspirin, ACEI and beta-blocker.
A lipid panel was checked and showed a low LDL and HDL in addition to high triglycerides.
Pump: Echo obtained showed an EF of 40-45% and focal hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral wall.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
mild (1+) mitral regurgitation and moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation were seen.
Non-gap acidosis: Felt to be secondary to diarrhea (a chronic issue); resolved on HD #2.
Rechecked and remained mildly elevated.
Syncope secondary to complete heart block  Secondary: 1.
Coronary artery disease 2.
Hyperlipidemia 3.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and in normal sinus rhythm.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after having a syncopal episode (fainting).
This is thought to be from having a complete heart block.
Please be sure to call your PCP if you experience pain or swelling at the incision site, experience fever >100.4, have chest pains, problems breathing or feel lightheaded or dizzy.
Do not lift anything greater than 5 pounds, or push or pull anything with your left arm, for one month.
