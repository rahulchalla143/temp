Admission Date:  [**2158-3-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-3-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-9-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**] Chief Complaint: STEMI.
Intraaortic balloon pump Swan-Ganz catheter  History of Present Illness:   Mr [**Known lastname 45820**] is a 52-year-old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia, transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] with STEMI, [**Location (un) 7622**] to [**Hospital1 18**], cath.
Patient was at a neighbour's place, help to fell trees when he experienced sub-sternal chest pressure.
He sat down, the pain improved, then worsened again.
He developed ventricular fibrillation and was shocked out of this rhythm with re-establishment of sinus rhythm, also notable for 5-[**Street Address(2) **] depression and t-wave inversion in V2-4, ST depression of 1 mm in I and large t-waves in III.
He was briefly at [**Hospital3 **] where ST-segment depression seen on EMS was again noted.
Chest pain improved.
Given a question of torsades (unclear but seen on beginning four inches of EMS strip EKG) he was sent on [**Location (un) **] with magnesium, but this was not given in the ED.
On [**Location (un) 7622**], Mr. [**Known lastname 45820**] [**Last Name (Titles) 43254**] again, was given 100 mcg more of fentanyl with chest pain dropping from [**4-3**] to [**12-4**].
Throughout this period from home until arrival in the cath lab, he was hemodynamically stable with pressures slightly elevated from 130s to 150s.
Given that atrial fibrillation was thought to be new and was likely contributing to hypotension, the patient was further sedated with successful electrical cardioversion.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for (+) chest pain, without dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Family History: Father had MI at 60.
No family history of arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Crackles throughout, no wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Some hair loss at ankles and shiny skin on feet.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
BRIEF HISTORY: 52 year old man with hypertension presented with chest pain, nausea/vomiting and ventricular fibrillation to an outside hospital.
The V fib was successfully cardioverted, and an ECG was consistent with inferoposterior STEMI.
He was transferred emergently to the [**Hospital1 18**] cardiac catheterization lab for right and left heart cath.
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: inferoposterior STEMI cad chest pain ventricular fibrillation  PROCEDURE: Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry of the right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure catheter, advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing sheath.

A Prowater wire crossed the wire without difficulty.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, TIMI 3 flow, and no apparent dissection.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a complex trifurcating lesion in the mid vessel that was 80-90%.
There was an 80% stenosis in the mid LAD that involved the origin of a major diagonal branch.
The RCA had a long 50% stenosis in the mid vessel.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP 16mmHg, and mean PCWP 25mmHg.
There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 38mmHg on dopamine gtt.
Mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Successful cardioversion of atrial fibrillation.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with lateral akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No newly developed consolidation.
The patient will take Plavix and other CAD regimen for one month, allowing for endothelium to appear within stent, before elective CABG, given extensive CAD.
Coronary Artery Disease   The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and LCx disease and had a stent placed to the LCx.
Symptomatic ischemia and EKG changes were likely derived from the occluded LCx.
CAD is a new diagnosis for this patient.
Atrial Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades de Pointes   Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case (concern for new onset MR, possibly consistent with echo, and atrial stretch).
It appeared responsible for hypotension, but hypotension continued despite resolution of AF ??????
however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered pressure.
Over the night following catheterization, the patient had frequent bouts of ventricular ectopy with PVCs, VT, AIVR, and one 14 second episode of self-limited torsades de [**Last Name (un) **].
Due to low blood pressures, beta-blocker was initially avoided and patient was loaded with amiodarone and started on an amiodarone gtt.
Swan-Ganz catheter was removed to prevent triggering arrhythmias.
He had very few to no ectopy at discharge.
Leukocytosis   Likely stress demargination in ACS and resolved with time.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet Sublingual every 5 mintues for total of 3 [**Date Range 4319**]: if you still have chest pain after 3 [**Date Range 4319**], call 911.
Disp:*25 tablets* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ST elevation myocardial infarction Acute Systolic Dysfunction: EF 45% Hypertension Dyslipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had a large heart attack and a bare metal stent was placed in your left circumflex artery.
You had some heart arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation that required cardioversion (shock) to fix, and short runs of ventricular tachycardia.
All of this irregular rhythms were thought to be due to your heart attack and have now resolved.
Your echocardiogram showed some wall motion abnormalities and your heart function is not as strong as it was before but we think this will improve over time.
Start using nitroglycerin if you have similar chest pain.
If you still have chest pain after 3 [**Last Name (STitle) 4319**], call 911.
