Admission Date:  [**2129-10-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2129-10-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2055-5-22**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year old male with a history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, chronic renal insufficiency, history of atrial fibrillation who was recently admitted on [**2129-9-21**] for atrial fibrillation and mildly elevated troponins, and discharged on [**2129-9-26**] and went to [**Hospital3 12564**] Hospital.
He recently presented back to an outside hospital with room air, oxygen saturations of 80% and had chest x-ray consistent with pulmonary edema, intubated and received Lasix 40 times one and another 80 times two upon transfer to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further management.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post left below the knee amputation.
Chronic renal insufficiency, creatinine baseline about 2.5.
Left intertrochanteric fracture, status post open reduction and internal fixation on [**2129-9-17**].
History of coronary artery disease, P-MIBI in [**2127**] showed large inferior reversible defect.
Echocardiogram in [**2129-9-12**] showed left atrial mildly dilated left wall thickness, normal ejection fraction of 40 to 50%, secondary to severe hypokinesis, inferior free wall and moderate hypokinesis of posterior wall, mild to 1+ mitral regurgitation.
History of atrial fibrillation.
History of hepatitis C. Cirrhosis, mentioned in outside hospital, secondary to history of hepatitis C, followed by hepatologist in [**Location (un) 86**].
History of questionable hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops or rubs.
Respiratory:  Bilateral bibasilar crackles, otherwise no changes.
Abdomen:  Soft, bowel sounds present, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  Left below the knee amputation, no edema, cyanosis or clubbing.
Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm and no major changes noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 74 year old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and diabetes, status post open reduction and internal fixation for left trochanteric fracture, coronary artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency who presented with worsening shortness of breath times one day and was also noted to be febrile to 102 on admission.
Etiology of his shortness of breath was concerning given his congestive heart failure history and cardiac versus pulmonary secondary to pneumonia as such.
Pump, he was given Lasix for diuresis which was able to get extubated without any difficulty and he was weaned off oxygen, now down to 2 liters, started two days before discharge and starting to have increased wheezing.
He was started on nebulizers which seemed to help but also decreased urinary output most likely to fluid overload, so on the day before his discharge his Hydralazine was increased to 75 q.i.d.
Blood pressure - He is normal sinus rhythm, he has history of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
On the day before discharge he was on 2 liters of oxygen but continued to have extreme wheezing, bilaterally diffuse and he was started on scheduled nebulizers which helped the patient and will continue with the nebulizers when discharged to the rehabilitation center.
He was also started on nesiritide for afterload reduce and perfuse kidney further which decrease in volume overload will help his pulmonary status.
Infectious disease - He has been afebrile since admission.
He was started on Levaquin for presumed pneumonia and to continue a 14 day course.
Questionable if dementia secondary to a current metabolic disorder or his baseline or new baseline.
Neurology will follow closely and Neurology recommended it is most likely secondary to metabolic disorder, partially secondary to his baseline now.
Renal - In terms of his renal status he now has an acute renal failure secondary to his chronic renal insufficiency.
He was kept on a cardiac, renal and diabetic diet.
Prophylaxis - Prophylactically he was given proton pump inhibitor, bowel regimen and heparin subcutaneously.
The patient was instructed to follow weights daily and to call his medical doctor if his weight had increased more than 3 pounds and to adhere to a 2 gm sodium diet very strictly and also a fluid-restricted diet and to seek medical attention as needed if new symptoms or old symptoms return.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure, no major surgical invasive procedures done except intubation.
Renal - Renif, breakfast, lunch and dinner with fluid-restricted diet.
