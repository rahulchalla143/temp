Admission Date: [**2117-12-17**]        Discharge Date: [**2118-1-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2043-6-24**]        Sex:  M  Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74-year-old Spanish speaking man with a known history of CAD, never revascularized, recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] for chemical cardioversion due to atrial fibrillation and home sotalol, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] of the electrophysiology service.
On [**12-17**] he was at home with friends when he had an acute loss of consciousness with question of seizure activity.
The patient had an O2 saturation in the 80s when they arrived, with a heart rate in the 130s, atrial fibrillation at that time and blood pressure with a systolic of 200.
Once he arrived in the Emergency Room he had a neurological workup with a CT scan that was negative for an acute bleed, and an event that was felt to be not likely neurological in nature.
The patient had no MI at that time, his enzymes were negative, and he was being worked up for an electrophysiology study with a probable ablation plus or minus a pacemaker, however, it was felt that prior to that procedure he should have a cardiac catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for CAD, congestive heart failure, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine 1.5 to 1.7, and left lower extremity cellulitis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for AAA repair in [**2108**] with a redo in [**2109**] and a thoracic aortic aneurysm repair done in [**2108**].
In general lying flat in bed in no acute distress.
Respiratory showed bilateral crackles in the bases, left greater than right.
Neck is supple with no carotid bruits.
Extremities warm and well perfused with 1 plus edema and bilateral varicosities.
Stress test done on [**11-24**] showed moderate reversible inferior lateral defect and an echo done on [**12-28**] showed an EF of 50 percent with 3 plus MR and 2 plus TR.
Chest x-ray at the time of admission showed mild pulmonary edema.
Carotid ultrasound showed no significant stenosis on either side.
In summary, the patient had a CABG times four with a LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein graft to diagonal, saphenous vein graft to ramus, and saphenous vein graft to the RPL.
On postoperative day two the patient was noted to be mildly confused.
He was also noted to have periods of atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate to the 130s.
He was, however, still in the ICU because of confusion with some combativeness, and he was noted to have short bursts of SVT versus VT rhythm.
On the [**2117-12-18**] he was brought to the electrophysiology lab for ablation plus or minus pacemaker placement.
Ultimately, the patient did have a permanent pacemaker implanted.
On postoperative day five the patient's neurological status was noted to be less confused, however, at night he became increasingly combative and hypertensive.
On postoperative day six the patient's neurological status had greatly improved, with no further episodes of agitation or confusion.
Sternum is stable without any erythema or drainage.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with no edema.
Left leg incision with Steri Strips open to air, clean and dry.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery    bypass grafting times four with left internal mammary    artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein    graft to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the ramus,    and saphenous vein graft to the RPL.
Atrial fibrillation.
Diabetes mellitus Type 2.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
