Cirrhosis- diagnosed by bx in [**Country 4194**] in [**2190**], developed ascites and edema 5 months ago, likely due to NASH, Hep B and C negative ([**6-16**]), now with ascites and grade II varices (EGD [**7-17**]); s/p TIPS 2.

Again seen are atherosclerotic calcifications within the visualized vertebral arteries and along the falx and tentorium cerebelli.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Persistent large amount of ascites surrounding liver.
Decrease in TIPS velocities.
SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLARY) TRAUMA RIGHT  [**2192-11-22**] 3:51 PM FINDINGS: There is a fracture involving the surgical neck of the right proximal humerus.
There is marked varus angulation and internal rotation of the humeral head at the fracture site since the previous study.
The humeral shaft is displaced anteriorly in relation to the humeral head.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 68 yo F with cirrhosis [**3-15**] presumed NASH, s/p large volume paracentesis on [**11-13**] presents with hypotension, hypothermia and hypoglycemia.
Her mental status was still poor after FS normalized and was given flumazenil empirically (last dose AM of [**2192-11-19**]) as she had been given benzos one week prior for ?seizure in setting of hypoglycemia.
Initial concern was for HRS versus abd compartment syndrome.
# Hypoglycemia - Resolved.
Felt to be secondary to glyburide interacting with ciprofloxacin.
the decision was made to allow more permissive glucose control given the risks and benefits of tight control given recent episode of hypoglycemia and her poor longterm prognosis and inability to qulaify for ongoing VNA teaching.
# Cirrhosis.
- she was not placed on SBP ppx given possible hypoglycemia induced by cipro vs. bactrim and since she has no h/o of SBP that we could identify in her chart.
# Hyponatremia: pt.
Likely secondary to cirrhosis.
She had no signs of bleeding, hct stable during admission   Medications on Admission: - Lactulose [**Hospital1 **] - Simethicone 80 0.5 daily - Citalopram 20 mg po daily - Pantoprazole 40 mg daily - Metoclopramide 10 mg PO QIDACHS - Oxycodone 5 mg PO Q4-6H - Furosemide 20 mg po daily - Spironolactone 25 mg po daily - Glyburide 5 mg po daily - Bactrim DS 160-800 mg PO twice a day for 5 days.
