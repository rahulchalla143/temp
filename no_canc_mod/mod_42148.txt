He had been recovering well without complaints until he returned to clinic for follow-up today and it was discovered when his staples were removed that he had a wound infection.
His wound was opened in two places, one near the superior aspect of the wound (near his groin) and one around the mid-thigh.
He was unable to tolerate deep/thorough debridement in clinic so he is being admitted for pain medication, bedside debridement, and antibiotic therapy.
He currently denies pain, recent fevers/chills, difficulty walking, changes in sensation or motor strength of his bilateral lower extremities.

He initially passed this evaluation but was noticed to be gargling and having difficulty swallowing.
The patient had new onset atrial fibrillation on the floor which was rate controlled with IV lopressor.
The patient has residual neurologic findings likely due to anoxic brain injury during his arrest, this was evaluated on [**2195-9-8**] with a head CT, which was essentially negative.
