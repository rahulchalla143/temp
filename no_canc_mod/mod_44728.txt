The patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2142-2-19**] to [**2142-2-21**] after presented with epigastric abdominal pain, jaundice and weight loss.
She was found to have an bilirubinemia of 12.5, mild transaminitis and abdominal imaging showing 1.6-cm dilatation of her common bile duct with RUQ showing intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with a hypoechoic focus at the level of pancreatic head.
There was no pancreatic mass and the pancreatic duct appeared normal.
She awoke and had a single, large frankly bloody bowel movement with clot burden and passing of the biliary stent (that filled the bowel).
She drank some tea and then subsequently felt lightheaded and dizzy and syncoped without LOC or head injury and recalls the events surrounding her fall.
The patient presented to [**Hospital6 33**] with these complaints.
Of note, she has had a 27-lb weight loss over several months with worsening fatigue and associated decreased PO intake and nightsweats with chills.
Exam revealed one more episode of frank hematochezia with clot that filled the bedpan in the ED.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she appears stable and denies abdominal pain, nausea or emesis.
She has had no further bleeding since her episode in the ED.
She denies chest pain or trouble breathing.
She denies lightheadedness or dizziness.
ROS: Denies headaches or vision changes.
No cough or upper respiratory symptoms.
Denies chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness; no palpitations.
No nausea or vomiting, denies abdominal pain.
No dysuria or hematuria.
Denies myalgias or neurologic complaints.

No masses or internal hemorrhoids.
Active bleeding noted.
A pulsatile, actively bleeding blood vessel was noted at the sphincterotomy.
Moderate amount of blood was noted in the second part of duodenum Three epinephrine injections 1 cc each was applied for hemostasis successfully at the sphincterotomy [**Hospital1 **]-CAP electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully at the sphincterotomy Complete hemostasis was achieved A filling defect was noted at the lower CBD consistent with the previously noted stone.
There was post obstructive dilation of the CBD with the CBD measuring 15 mm.
A 5cm by 10mm double pig tail biliary stent was placed successfully  (hemostasis, hemostasis, stent placement) Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Transfuse pRBC and FFP as needed Q8hr hct checks NPO overnight until hct stabilizes and no evidence of active bleeding is noted.
No pleural or pericardial effusion is seen.
No focal liver lesions are detected.
Colonic diverticula do not demonstrate evidence for inflammation.
No free intraperitoneal air or ascites is detected.
In the superior portion of the head of the pancreas, there is a hypodense lesion which measures roughly 14 x 12 mm in the axial plane.
There is no pancreatic duct dilation.
A few small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are noted; the largest measures 9 mm in short axis dimension.
There is a 1-cm portocaval node.
This mass mildly indents the inferior aspect of the proximal main portal vein less than 1 cm from the confluence and it appears that the low density abnormality involves the portal vein wall for roughly 90 degress along its inferior aspect for less than 1 cm in length.
Visualized vasculature is otherwise uninvolved and within normal limits including the splenic vein, superior mesenteric vein, celiac trunk and branches, superior mesenteric artery, and visualized portion of the inferior mesenteric artery.
Extensive arterial atherosclerotic calcification is noted.
No concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are detected.
IMPRESSION: Roughly 14 mm hypodense lesion in the superior head of the pancreas with concern for involvement of a short portion of the inferior wall of the main portal vein.
No definite adenopathy or metastasis.

# BRIGHT RED BLOOD PER RECTUM, FALLING HEMATOCRIT - Patient presented with rectal bleeding with hematochezia in the setting of recent ERCP that involved biliary stenting and sphincterotomy.
She received IVF and 4 units of packed red cells and 2 units of FFP, and 4 mg of PO vitamin K. She was urgently taken to ERCP ([**2-22**]) and pt was noted to have an acute arterial bleed at the recent sphincterotomy site.
# RETAINED BILIARY DUCT STONE/BILE DUCT OBSTRUCTION # HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA/JAUNDICE/CHOLESTATIC HEPATITIS Patient presented on [**2142-2-19**] with obstructive jaundice, weight loss and abdominal pain complaints.
ERCP demonstrated 1-cm distal CBD stone which was unsuccessfully extracted and sphincterotomy with biliary stenting was performed on [**2143-2-20**].
Given failed stone removal, patient was encouraged to follow-up for extraction vs. lithotripsy.
She had no abdominal pain complaints; no fevers to suggest cholangitis.
# PANCREATIC HEAD MASS, WEIGHT LOSS - Despite her recent biliary stone obstruction with ERCP procedure, the patient also has also endorsed 27-lb weight loss over 3-weeks (on admission 69.3 kg).
No report of nightsweats, fevers or chills.
Has had no increased fatigue.
Denied fatty or voluminous stool output.
Recent RUQ U/S on [**2142-2-19**] demonstrated a 1.6-2 cm hypoechecoic focus in the region of the pancreatic head, without pancreatic ductal dilatation (which was confirmed on ERCP).
She underwent CTA Pancreas, which showed 14 mm hypodense lesion in the superior head of the pancreas with concern for involvement of a short portion of the inferior wall of the main portal vein.
These results were discussed with ERCP team, and patient will return in approximately 1 week for EUS with FNA biopsy of the mass for further evaluation.
# INAPPROPRIATELY ELEVATED INR - Pt was noted to have INR 2 at time of admission, likely due to decreased PO intake with recent weight loss.
Has also been on Ciprofloxacin for recent biliary instrumentation.
# HYPERTENSION - Presented with diagnosis of hypertension and home regimen of beta-blocker and ACEI.
# RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS - Patient reportedly has stable disease and has been on Percocet 5/325 mg PO 1-2 tabs PO Q4-6H PRN pain.
# REFLUX ESOPHAGITIS, GERD - Remote history without active symptoms.
Limited evaluation of the esophagus and stomach on ERCP ([**2142-2-21**]) was normal.
# DEPRESSION - Mood appears stable.
# Hx RECURRENT HSV INFECTION - No current evidence of active infection.

Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized with an acute bleed from your ERCP procedure.
The bleeding stopped, and your blood levels have stabilized.
During this hospitalization, imaging showed a mass in your pancreas.
While it remains unclear what this mass is, it is extremely important that this is further evaluated.
