# Upper GI bleed.
The patient presented with hemodynamically significant coffee-ground emesis and melena.
He was mildly tachycardic and mildly hypotensive (90's/50's) on presentation.
Emergent EGD revealed erosive ulcerations in the esophagus and erosive gastritis.
Likely this is secondary to chronic NSAID use.
The patient was maintained with an active T&S and 2 large bore peripheral IV's, though he had no more hemodynamically significant bleeding.
# Zencker's Diverticulum.
The patient's EGD revealed a question of a Zencker's Diverticulum.
The patient became extremely withdrawn and refused the study for unclear reason, though by his account because the study was unexpected.
# Schizophrenia.
The patient had an odd affect and intermittently would become withdrawn and sometimes combative.
