History of Present Illness: 28 y/o F w/ [**First Name3 (LF) **] syndrome (Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy, and Deafness) which is a progressive disease thought to be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction with aspects of demyelination, and as a result autonomic dysfunction w/ orthostatic hypotension, recurrent PNA and UTIs, and subacute on chronic worsening of respiratory status with associated fatigue and lethargy as well as OSA p/w 1 month of increasing fatigue, lethargy, and hypoxia.
At that time neurology was consulted to comment on her progressively worsening respiratory status as well as difficulty speaking and swallowing which they did not feel was [**3-14**] GBS, MG or MS.
This was thought to be [**3-14**] [**Month/Day (2) **]'s disorder as pts w/ this often develop severe polyneuropathy, and some may develop a progressive central hypoventilation syndrome.
She presents from home this time for worsening dyspnea w/ exertion and shortness of breath at rest sometimes desatting to the 90s while speaking, while on 4L NC.
On presentation to the ICU, pt reports fatigue due to poor sleep over the past few nights but her breathing has been the same as the last time she was in the ICU.
Positive chronic bladder difficulty with voiding, requiring intermittent straight caths.

There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
Low lung volumes.
Brief Hospital Course: 28 year old female with [**Month/Day/Year **]'s syndrome admitted for BiPAP initiation given worsening dyspnea and hypercarbia as an outpatient.
#Dyspnea and Hypercarbia: Thought to be a chronic restrictive process from neuromuscular dysfunction secondary to Wolframs syndrome.
A CXR revealed low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
Blood cultures were sent in the ED despite the low suspicion for infection and were pending at the time of discharge.
On the second day she developed symptoms of urgency and dysuria.
Consequently, started on empiric treatment for UTI with Cipro for 5 days.
She was continued on her home long acting and short acting insuling for glycemic control.
