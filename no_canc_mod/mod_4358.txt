He reports a mild cough over the last two days productive of clear sputum.
He was noted today at his [**Hospital 4382**] to have a fever (no temp recorded) and to be hypoxic and was therefore referred to the ED.
Per the patient's family members, he has also been more SOB with exertion over the past few days.
The patient himself denies any acute exacerbation of his SOB or any distress.
He reports + PND, once at night, but denies any orthopnea, chest pain, N, V, or lightheadedness.
He also denies any calf swelling, weight loss or f/c/ns, hemoptysis, myalgias or arthralgias.
CXR concerning for R perihilar infiltrate.
On the floor, the patient developed an acute worsening in his respiratory status around 8am, 5 hours after admission to the floor.
An EKG showed mild 1mm STD in lateral leads.
The Cath revealed a prox 70% LAD lesion, 100% OM2 lesion and a non-obstructing plaque in the RCA.

No significant left ICA stenosis (graded as less than 40%).
Hypoplastic or occluded right vertebral artery.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.9cm2).
Mild [1+] aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: Upon admission to the floor, the patient developed an acute worsening in his respiratory status and was transferred to the MICU.
He was transferred to the CCU for management of his hypoxia in the setting of severe aortic stenosis.
Respiratory therapy was consulted, and the patient's acute hypoxia improved with small doses of lasix, and continuous nebulized treatments with albuterol and ipratropium.
A CXR was consistent RLL PNA and mild pulmonary edema.
Despite clinically improving, he continued to intermittently spike fevers on this regimen, afte which vancomycin was added.
His CXR showed near-complete resolution of his right lower lobe consolidation.
This trended down to his baseline with continued diuresis, indicating that this was a problem with forward flow inthe setting of aortic stenosis.
Menthol-Cetylpyridinium 3 mg Lozenge Sig: One (1) Lozenge Mucous membrane PRN (as needed) as needed for cough.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) actuation Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
[**Location (un) 5481**])  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Pulmonary edema .
Secondary diagnoses: Severe aortic stenosis Hypertension   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you were short of breath, and we diagnosed pneunomia and pulmonary edema (fluid in your lungs).
The cardiac surgeons would like to wait to perform surgery until your pneumonia resolves.
