On discharge: Patient's lungs were clear to auscultation bilateraly, and she reported symptomatic improvement of her cough and shortness of breath.
CXR: Findings consistent with worsening pulmonary edema on a background of chronic lung disease.
Bilateral small effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
Labs on discharge: WBC-7.5 RBC-3.91* Hgb-11.3* Hct-33.9* MCV-87 MCH-29.0 MCHC-33.4 RDW-13.8 Plt Ct-360 Glucose-110* UreaN-54* Creat-2.6* Na-142 K-3.7 Cl-99 HCO3-29 AnGap-18 Calcium-9.0 Phos-6.0* Mg-2.2  Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo female with history of COPD, RCC s/p resection, chronic adrenal insufficiency presents with dyspnea admitted to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.
#  Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial from COPD flare, CAP (RLL infiltrate, cough, fever), and volume overload from possible new CHF.
She was diuresed with IV lasix, and her symptoms improved.
Patient was treated for COPD flare with prednisone 60 mg daily and standing nebs.
## New onset CHF: Patient presented with volume overload and responded well to diuresis as detailed above.
No echo was performed because patient reported a recent echo with PCP.
She was also discharged with lasix to prevent volume overload.
#  Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr on admission was 2.6 which was elevated from her baseline around 2.
This was most likely secondary to poor PO intake from recent illness as her Cr improved with PO hydration.
At no point during this hospital course did patient have s/s adrenal insufficiency.
Her lisinopril continued to be held secondary to renal failure (see above).
#) Anemia: Normocytic anemia most likely due to renal failure and decreased epo.
Patient was discharged home in stable condition with symptomatic improvement.
