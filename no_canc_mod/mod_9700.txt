His pain started about 2 days ago and was vaguely located in the lower abdomen.
It worsened overnight until it became unbearable at 6am today, and he called an ambulance to bring him to the ED.
The pain is mostly in the LLQ and is sharp.
He states the pain is somewhat similar to when he had perforated diverticulitis 10 years ago, but is less severe now.

An abdominal CT was performed which showed irregularly distended loop of distal bowel in the pelvis with questionable pneumatosis and with numerous foci of adjacent extraluminal gas which tracks into a right-sided anterior pelvic wall hernia.
Mild surrounding inflammation and only trace pelvic free fluid.
As these findings were suggestive of possibly chronic inflammation leading to eventual bowel rupture, and concern for rupture near the anastomosis of the previous Hartmanns repair, a surgical consult with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was obtained.
He was taken the same day to the OR for Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of  adhesions, small bowel resection and rectal resection with end ileostomy and removal of a large amount of fecal peritonitis.
Patient is noted to have a non-functioning left upper arm AV graft which appears to be recently placed, however non-functional.
The patient remained hypotensive and on HD 3 was still requiring pressors and was given 2 units pRBC's.
On [**8-14**] the patient was taken back to the OR as he was still having pressor requirements and elevated WBC.
Patients status improved following this second surgery, no additional pressor requirement and CVVH was transitioned to intermittent HD.
The ostomy looked healthy, gas and stool noted in bag and mucous fistula with output.
Hemodialysis has been continued on an intermittent basis (Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday) The initial incision area was opened due to drainage.
It has been packed with NS wet to dry dressings and has improved in appearance, the base of the shallow wound has pink granulating tissue.
He has been tolerating the tube feeds without diarrhea or nausea/vomiting.
He also had a low grade fever to 100.1 for several days in a row during that time.
Urine culture was no growth, blood cultures are negative to date but not finalized.. A repeat abdominal CT was done on [**8-22**], the rectal anastomosis appeared intact with no focal fluid collection or evidence of developing abscess.
There were areas of fluid but no organized collection.
HD medications Please evaluate for IV Iron and Epogen dosing per HD protocol   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 25750**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Rectal perforation s/p end ileostomy and mucous fistula creation Failed kidney transplant now on hemodialysis Malnutrition Abdominal incision drainage, now open with dressings [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Please contact [**Name2 (NI) 42268**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] for surgical concerns regarding the end ileostomy or mucous fistula.
