KUB: There is a nonspecific non-obstructed bowel gas pattern with no evidence for free air, pneumatosis or ascites.
Within the stool filled right colon there is some scattered dense material of uncertain etiology.
Note is made that this is a limited ultrasound due to the patient's body habitus and her current condition.
Brief Hospital Course: # ETOH withdrawal: Patient with multiple admissions for ETOH withdrawal in the past.
Patient with history of DT's/seizures in the past, and has required large amounts of valium in the past as well.
# Abdominal pain/nausea/vomiting: Likely largely a component of heavy ETOH use/withdrawal.
In light of diverticulis in past, as well as colorectal surgery in [**12-4**] (?perf), somewhat worrisome for other intrabdominal pathology.
However, physical exam is reassuring, and no fever/white count.
As per patient, she is stooling often, so no concern for obstruction.
Abdominal pain may be related to possible infectious colitis in light of diarrhea.
No clear ascites on exam, but would also consider SBP.
Ultrasound showed no ascites.
# Chest pain/SOB/cough: Patient does not currently endorse chest pain or SOB.
Possibly has some component of COPD in light of >20 year hx smoking.
CXR was normal, patient is afebrile with normal sat's.
EKG showed no changes and one set of cardiac enzymes was normal.
# Hepatitis C: Patient followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Rechecked TSH and T4 which were mildly abnormal.
#loose stool: pt had mildly loose stool, c-diff negative.
Likely hypertensive now b/c of withdrawal.
# Access: peripherals .
