Patient has a history of coronary artery disease with a MI and CABG at [**Hospital6 1129**] in [**2111**] with reverse SVG to LAD and circ.
He reports that since [**Month (only) **] he has noticed exertional chest tightness.
The patient also has a history of atrial flutter, status post successful cardioversion in [**2134-7-5**] and [**2135-8-5**].
He had positive diffuse ischemic EKG changes inferior and anterolaterally, these resolved by 10 minutes into recovery.
Imaging revealed a mild reversible lateral defect.

No jugular venous distention.
Lower extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
The LAD was diffusely diseased and mildly calcified.
The vessel had a long 80% mid vessel stenosis and a 70% distal stenosis of the site of prior anastomosis.
The left circ gave off a totally occluded OM-1 branch, with left-to-left collaterals and antegrade flow through a stenotic SVG graft.
RCA had mild diffuse disease.
There was extensive graft disease.
The SVG to OM-1 had an 80% complex stenosis in the proximal part and a 60% stenosis in the mid graft.
However, during the post procedure period, the patient was noted to be hypotensive and had a right atrial pressure of 8.
He underwent a CT scan, which was negative for a retroperitoneal bleed.
