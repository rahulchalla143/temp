Over 7-10 days, pt has been ill w/ nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
He has had intermittent emesis, that she believes is non-bloody, non-biliary.
He has had worsening abdominal distension as well, w/ very poor po intake.
He was also complaining of abdominal pain.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2195-3-24**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2195-3-27**]):    NO GROWTH.
Otherwise, no evidence of acute intracranial process.
Please note that MRI is more sensitive in detecting small intracranial lesions.
Doppler assessment of the main portal vein and their branches shows patency and hepatopetal flow.
Distended gallbladder with sludge without gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid.
Cholecystitis cannot be entirely excluded based on this study, if there is high clinical concern.
If high clinical concern for cholecystitis, could further evaluate with a HIDA scan.
CHEST XR [**2195-3-20**]: Small bilateral effusions with associated atelectasis.
Mild pulmonary edema  PELVIS (AP ONLY)	Study Date of [**2195-3-23**] 10:38 PM FINDINGS: There is an apparent urinary catheter in the urethra and bladder.
No bone lesion or fracture is seen.
- LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)	Study Date of [**2195-3-25**] 1:57 PM ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: Again noted is a heterogeneous nodular shrunken liver consistent with a known history of cirrhosis.
The other peripheral lesion within segment VI, abutting the hepatorenal space is also seen and hypoechoic in comparison to the surrounding parenchyma measuring 2.1 x 2.6 x 3.7 cm.
One additional echogenic nodule within segment VII/VIII is noted with no clear correlate on the MRI, measuring 7 x 11 x 14 mm.
The other lesions within segment V on the MRI are not clearly seen.
Moderate amount of ascites remains.
The lesion locations would make the procedure technically challenging and high risk given the proximity to surrounding vessels, gallbladder and kidney.
A moderate amount of ascites persists and a paracentesis would have to be done prior to the procedure to minimize any risk of capsular bleeding.
1 cm hyperechoic nodule, likely within segment VII or VIII without clear MRI correlate.
Four lesions displaying mild arterial enhancement and washout meet imaging criteria for HCC within segment V/VIII (one lesion), segment VI (two lesions), and segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] (one lesion).
Two lesions within segment II display only washout but without increased arterial enhancement.
Both are hyperdense on non-contrast CT. Additional small segment VIII lesion also only seen on most delayed images without arterial enhancement.
These may represent dysplastic nodules or hypovascular HCC's.
Known cirrhotic-appearing liver with sequelae of portal hypertension including abdominal/esophageal varices and splenomegaly as well as mild-to-moderate amount of ascites.
Edema within the large bowel presumably related to congestive enteropathy.
Biliary sludge and gallstones as seen on prior MRI.
Small pancreatic head cyst is of doubtful significance for this patient and can be watched on future exams.
Small left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 year old male with PMH significant for HIV (on HARRT, last CD4 629), ESLD, HCV cirrhosis w/ possible left lobe liver cancer, who was being admitted to the ICU w/ AMS  # Cirrhosis: The patient has known Hepatitis C, both by history as well as by viral load in hospital, as well as a reported heavy history of EToH use.
On admission, given reported episodes of fevers at home as well as abdominal pain, there was serious concern for SBP, and the patient was started on empiric antibiotics with ceftrixaone.
RUQ U/S showed a cirrhotic liver and ascities, but without evidence of cholecystitis or PVT.
Additionally, there was no evidence of GI bleed.
Subsequent diagnostic tap did not reveal any evidence of SBP, however, as noted above, this was in the setting of having already received antibiotics.
The patient underwent an MRCP secondary to concerns from patient's PCP about [**Name Initial (PRE) **] possible liver lesions.
MRCP discovered five liver lesions of various sizes, detailed in the results section of this report.
Two of these lesions were amenable to biopsy, but given the patient's history, multiple lesions, and potential complications of biopsy, the patient in consultation with physicians here elected not to performed the biopsy, as the results were felt to be almost certain to reveal malignancy (perhaps HCC versus cholangiocarcinoma) that would not be amenable to treatment; the patient indicated he did not want to know if this were the case.
Palliative care was consulted, and provided counseling regarding resources for palliative care.
A repeat triphasic CT confirmed that the pattern of filling of the lesions in the liver was consistent with HCC.
AMS was felt to be secondary to decompensated liver failure as well as a component of SBP.
Some of the patient's alteration in mental status was also presumed to medication effect, and initially the patient's home dose of methadone was decreased; however, this was up-titrated back to his home dose on discharge.
On discharge, the patient was noted to be AAOx3, follwoing commands, and conversant, and without any asterixis (he had had very prominent asterixis on admission).
# Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine appeared to normalize over the course of his admission with albumin and IV fluid.
# HypoNa: The patient was noted to be hyponatremic on admission, likely secondary to dehydration, which resolved with hydration.
This hypoglycemia was presumed secondary to acute infection with SBP; the patient remained normoglycemic throughout the remainder of his admission.
An AM cortisol was sent off to rule out adrenal insuffiency as a cause of hypoglycemia, but AM cortisol was within normal limits.
# Chest Pain: Not currently bothersome to patient.
However, he does describe a long history of intermittent chest pressure with may require outpatient follow-up.
Disp:*1 quantity sufficient* Refills:*2* 5. rifaximin 550 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day: Please take this medication for hepatic encephalopathy prophylaxis.

You were admitted to the hospital because you had been having some abdominal pain and had some alteration in your mental status.
After performing some images, we believes that you had an infection in the fluid which had accumulated in your abdomen, and treated you with an appropriate course of antibotics.
