She was admitted on [**2174-7-22**] for CHF exacerbation and discharged yesterday.
She was initally treated with Lasix, went into worsening renal failure, and started on hemodialysis.
Her course was also complicated by upper GI bleed, of which an EGD showed multiple AVMs.
She did have increased productive cough with mostly clear, occasionally blood-tinged phlegm.
She then became acutely short of breath while lying down.
On review of symptoms, her husband denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery.
She continues to complain of leg pain for which she was taking neurotin and vicodin.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, palpitations, syncope, or presyncope.
She has never had ankle edema in the past.

Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo woman with h/o CAD s/p cypher DES to LCX [**2174-5-13**], severe aortic stenosis with valvular area of 0.5 cm2 despite recent aortic valvuloplasty on [**2174-5-11**], frequent hospitalizations for CHF exacerbation (last d/c [**2174-8-5**]), upper GI bleed from AVMs, and ESRD recently restarted on HD who returned w/SOB, dialyzed, and discharged back to extended care facility.
# CHF Exacerbation:  Patient initially presented with volume overload on CXR and acute shortness of breath, was placed on facemask, then later weaned to nasal cannula.
The patient was emergently dialyzed, and subsequently her shortness of breath resolved.
# Coronary artery disease: DES to LCx in [**2174-5-11**], other coronaries w/o obstructive disease.
Patient had CP the night before admission and ECG showed J Point elevation.
Patient was chest pain free subsequently, EKG's were done which showed some minor elevations, but none concerning enough in lieu of her existing LBBB.
Patient was continued on her beta blocker, CE's were followed and remained within the range of 0.11 which is her chronic level and not concerning given the lack of an acute rise, and her existing chronic kidney disease.
Plavix and ASA were held given her recent upper GI bleed.
# Aortic Stenosis:  Worsened after valvuloplasty in [**4-21**].
No realistic percutaneous option as patient has 4 exclusion criteria for most feasible trial.
# Anxiety:  Patient has had considerable anxiety on this admission and during her stay at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
The patient was amenable to and was given a prescription for citalopram.
# ID:  Pt presented with leukocytosis, though it later resolved along with the rest of her CBC values, suggesting an inaccurate measurement.
Pt had been afebrile and most recent WBC has decreased to WNL.
U/A was positive but contaminated and pt had long history of positive U/As with negative UCx, recently completed 5 day course of cipro.
Pt recently ended course of Vancomycin for strep veridins bacteremia.
# Upper GI Bleed: Hct suspiciously high.
# Acute on chronic RF on Dialysis: Pt was given emergent dialysis the day of admission, was also given EPO that she was scheduled to receive.
Her shortness of breath resolved with subsequent scheduled dialyses.
# Neovascular glaucoma:  Patient developed severe eye pain on [**8-10**] while at dialysis.
On physical exam, patient's right eye was injected, her pupil was dilated and non-reactive, and she experienced pain in right eye when shining pen light into left eye.
Ophthalmology was consulted, and she was found to have neovascular glaucoma, an uncommon complication of retinal artery occlusion.
Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 5-500 mg Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain relief.
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute on Chronic Congestive Heart Failure Severe Aortic Stenosis Acute on Chronic Renal Failure Secondary: [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Tear Osteoarthritis Central Retinal Artery Occlusion Macular Degeneration   Discharge Condition: Stable, ambulating, eating and drinking without complaint.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you became acutely short of breath.
It was later believed that this episode was similar to other episodes of shortness of breath that you have experienced.
Those experiences were due to your heart being unable to beat strongly enough through your narrowed valve and your body having an excess of fluid, which backed up into your lungs.
If you continue to experience any acute shortness of breath, extreme chest pain, or severe light-headedness, please contact your primary care provider at once.
