The patient spiked a low grade fever to 100.6 with an increased white blood cell count to 18.5 and 23.0.
He had ascites tapped on [**2156-6-30**], with 2300 white blood cells and he was treated for peritonitis with two grams Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin.
Then on [**2156-7-11**], the patient developed severe right lower quadrant pain and an ultrasound was done which showed a hernia which was obstructed.
