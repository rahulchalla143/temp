There was some discrepancy between CTA and carotid dupplex regarding severity of stenosis but both studies referred to it as "high grade".
Pt denies any current dizziness, lightheadedness, change in vision, nausea, chest pain, shortness of breath, neck pain, abdominal pain, lower extremity numbness tingling or pain.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history bleeding at the time of surgery, hemoptysis, or red stools.
He denies black stools prior to that and states he has never had an EGD and has no history of GI bleeding (pt is also on oral iron).
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, - Hypertension 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - CVA [**11/2136**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] with mild residual left sided weakness and STM deficits - Chronic gait disturbance pre CVA, now worse ?
related to diabetic neuropathy versus alcohol peripheral neuropathy.
- Alcohol related peripheral neuropathy - Prior alcohol abuse with abnormal liver function tests -> had been off statins as a result - Current tobacco use - Depression - flat affect.
Not currently on meds - PVD - Type 2 Diabetes - managed with diet and oral agents - Chronic left ICA occlusion - Hypertrigylceridemia - Chronic skin ulcer - Phalanx fracture - Esophagitis - on Bx.

He has never been married and does not have any children.
He uses a walker for his chronic gait disturbance.
He does have some short term memory deficits.

ABDOMEN: Soft, mildly distended.
No HSM or tenderness.
Small surrounding bleeding from placement.
Cath site in L groint with small surrounding bleeding from palcement but no palpable hematoma and no femoral bruit.
No pain to palp SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Due to fact that R carotid stent was placed near the carotid body, there was concern that pt might have labile BP post-op and he was admitted to CCU for close monitoring and possible nitro or dobutamine drips.
Pt not reporting any symptoms and with good peripheral pulses and good post-angioseal groin exam.
# Hct drop: Pt with vague report of one dark stool day prior to admission while on ASA/Plavix.
Pt also on oral iron and with no Hx of GI bleed, no bright red blood, and no past EGD so black stool most likely [**2-8**] to iron supplements.
# Tobacco Use: Pt still smoking a few cigarettes each day at home, but with no symptoms or signs of nicotine withdrawal so no nicotine patch initiated as pt did not think he neeeded this.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Bilateral Carotid Artery Stenosis  Secondary: -Diabetes Mellitus -Peripheral Vascular Disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were monitored in the cardiac intensive care unit after the procedure for close monitoring and you had no complications.
It is very important that you continue take all medications as prescribed, particularly your aspirin and Plavix to prevent re-stenosis of the carotid artery.
