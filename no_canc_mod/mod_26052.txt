RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver demonstrates a 1.8 x 1.6 x 1.5 cm well circumscribed echogenic focus of the posterior right hepatic lobe compatible with a hemangioma.
There is no pericholecystic fluid.
There is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no ascites.
Contracted gallbladder with small stones and sludge.
No intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, with the common duct measuring 3-4 mm.
1.8 cm well circumscribed echogenic focus of the posterior right hepatic lobe is consistent with an hemangioma.
Left ventricular function.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic root.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.
Based on [**2133**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Based on [**2133**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2143-4-19**] 6:00 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: interval changes in lung volumes, infiltrate  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 66 year old man new transfer from OSH with pancreatitis, Elevated Peak Pressures, abd distention REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: interval changes in lung volumes, infiltrate AP CHEST, 6:07 A.M., [**2143-4-19**].
Left lower lobe collapse has not improved.
Lung volumes are low normal.
Small bilateral pleural effusions unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2143-4-22**] 9:49 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: Intracranial process causing sedation and coma  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 66 year old man with pancreatitis, Off all sedation but not responding neurologically REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Intracranial process causing sedation and coma CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: 66-year-old male with history of pancreatitis.
FINDINGS: There are very severe periventricular hypodensities.
These are more severe in the bilateral frontal lobes where there is loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter differentiation at some point.
There is also encephalomalacia and atrophy involving predominantly the right temporal lobe.
There is a lacunar infarct within the left thalamus.
The above findings are most likely secondary to chronic ischemic changes and chronic infarcts.
There is no evidence of herniation.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures.
No evidence of mass effect.
There is mild opacification of the bilateral maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinuses, and sphenoid sinuses.
There is severe septal deviation to the right side.
There is mild opacification of the external auditory canal bilaterally (left greater than right), correlate with physical examination.
There is mild opacification of the bilateral mastoid air cells.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
Chronic encephalomalacic changes likely representing chronic infarcts and chronic ischemia.
Mild opacification of the paranasal sinus, and mastoid air cells as was described above.
REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]   FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Brief polymorphic bursts of moderate to, at times, moderately high voltage mixed frequency slower theta were seen bifrontally, without clear laterality at times in a somewhat bursting character.
BACKGROUND: Well-formed and moderately well-sustained moderate voltage 10 Hz activity was seen biposteriorly present without significant asymmetry.
CARDIAC MONITOR: No arrhythmias noted.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG due to some bifrontal slow bursts.
Whether this represents increased cortical hyperreactivity related to subcortical or deeper midline structures increased irritability is uncertain.
No definitive spike discharges were seen.
No persistent slowing suggestive of a destructive or structural process could be seen.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 66 year old pancreatitis w/ new Dobhoff placement.
New Dobbhoff tube placement.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 11:21 a.m.:  New feeding tube, with wire stylet in place passes through the distal stomach and out of view.
Moderate left pleural effusion has increased.
Left lower lobe atelectasis is stable.
Atelectasis at the medial aspect of the right lung is worsening.
Mediastinal venous engorgement and upper lobe vascular dilatation have worsened indicating cardiac decompensation or volume overload although heart size remains normal.
No pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2143-4-29**] 4:42 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: ETT placement  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 66 year old pancreatitis w/ new Dobhoff placement.
There is no Dobbhoff tube inserted demonstrated on the current film.
The heart size is markedly decreased as well as there is prominent improvement of bilateral pulmonary edema with decreased bilateral, mostly on the left, pleural effusion.
Marked improvement with almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema and decrease in left pleural effusion.
Pancreatitis: Amylase and lipase were very elevated on admission to [**Location (un) **] (AST and ALT mildly elevated).
US and CT were suspicious for gallstones in cystic duct with dilation of CBD.
Persistent fevers are concerning for necrotic pancreas, and most recent CT had findings suspicious for phlegmon.
?PNA: CXR concerning for pna at left base, with klebsiella in sputum - continue meropenem/ vanco - repeat sputum culture - repeat CXR (?tappable effusion) .
Respiratory failure: hypercarbic, ?in setting of sepsis - will ck ABG, wean vent as tolerated - treat PNA, may need to tap effusion - fentanyl and versed for sedation - [**4-25**] trach'ed .
Ileus: will repeat KUB, NGT to suction if necessary, NPO with TPN .
NSVT: will continue amio gtt, is currently hemodynamically stable, will shock if unstable rhythm - t/c cards input if ectopy persists - replete lytes as needed .
