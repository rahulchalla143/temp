The pain radiates from her back to her L axilla or starts in her L axilla and radiates to her L shoulder blade.
The pain has been going on for days, but on day of presentation, the pain was not relieved with 3 nitro.
She describes the pain as very different than the pain that brought her in recently with an MI.
In ED, her intial vitals were HR 60's BP 194/83 and EKG showed Q in III and aVF and inverted T's in II, III, aVF and V4-V6 with no ST changes.
Coronary artery disease.
Pacemaker (Pacesetter A-V pacer) placement for sick sinus syndrome (installed for bradycardia) 3.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.4 to 1.7.
Anemia secondary to renal disease.
Pale HEENT: Some scleral pallor, NCAT, OP clear, Neck supple, No bruit, No JVD visible, No LAD CV: RRR, nml S1/S2, no extra heart sounds, II/VI SEM at USB with some radiation to axilla (holosystolic).
Pacer is in place over L shoulder and is mildly TTP.
No dullness to percussion.
No evidence of intrathoracic aortic dissection.
Dense atherosclerotic changes, including coronary artery calcifications, with multiple areas of ulcerated plaque.
Patchy opacity within the superior aspect of left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.
Multiple 3 mm noncalcified pulmonary nodules bilaterally, increased in number since prior exam dated [**2150-3-4**].
Several calcified pulmonary nodules scattered bilaterally.
CXR: IMPRESSION:  Unchanged appearance of the chest with mild cardiomegaly.
No overt congestive failure or pneumonia.
EKG: Atrial paced at 60 with Q waves in III and aVF and TWI in inferior leads and V4-V6, no ST changes.
Presented with atypical CP in setting of anemia and hypertension.
She was admitted to the cardiology service after a CT that was negative for dissection and a non-contrast abd CT that revealed no intraperitoneal process.
The patient complained of nausea and had some vomiting in the hospital.
She also complained of a number of different types of chest pain over her first 24 hours of hospitalization.
Repeated EKG's showed no changes c/w ischemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: #Cardiac: a) Ischemia: The patient had a history of thrombus to RCA with TO of RCA and 5 hepacoat stents.
2 weeks prior to this admission, she was taken to the cath lab for STEMI and had 5 Cypher stents to same area of RCA for restenosis.
She continuee to have inverted T's inf and lat, and q's inf, but no ST changes.
Her pain was not consistent with typical CP (reproduced with palpation, not assoc with exercise).
Because she had CP in the ED, she was started on a nitro drip to make her pain free.
During the first 2 days, the patient complained of mild TTP over her L chest wall, but no spontaneous chest pain.
The waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] nature of this chest pain and its lack of associated symptoms and its chronicity (from her last hospitalization until now) with hours of pain that can be reproduced is c/w atypical CP.
b) pump: The patient has a known HTN history with known diastolic CHF.
The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was held at her last hospitalization for rising creatinine and low BP as stated above.
Pt had one episode of flash pulm edema in setting of high BP in the morning.
On day of discharge she had an episode of some lightheadedness with SBP of 76.
She was not taking enough fluids and was given a small bolus of 250cc.
c) rhythm- The patient has a h/o a/v pacemaker placement in [**2144**] for sinus brady.
The patient is atrial paced, and therefore it was felt to be safe to titrate up her BB to increase BP control without great concern for HR.
Pt had history of nosebleeds in coumadin however after contacting Dr. [**Name (NI) **], pt's outpt cardiologist, she was started on coumadin.
# Renal: The patient has a h/o CRI due to hypertensive nephropathy.
Her [**Doctor First Name 48**] was thought likely secondary to aggresive diuresis and further diuresis should be held until repeat electrolytes show improvement in creatinine.
# Heme: The patient's anemia was previously thought to be [**1-22**] CKD and anemia of chronic disease.
CT abd showed no RP bleed.
No evidence of hematoma in groin was observed on exam.
Anemia previously thought to be [**1-22**] CKD.
Ferritin low, TIBC low, Transferrin low - likely mixed chronic dz, chronic kidney dz, and iron deficiency.
The patient could have had a small GI source to her bleed.
She was started on [**Hospital1 **] PPI in case of an upper GI bleed.
She may also need repeated blood transfusions to maintain her HCT given her history of low HCT and 3VD.
# Podagra: Pt had an episode of toe pain, consistent with classic gout.
Likely due to aggressive diuresis.
- Hold ASA until acute gouty attack has resolved.
# Nausea: Pt has chronic hx of nausea with upper GI negative in [**2153**] per pt's daughter.
Will start reglan and cont as OP - this may decrease her feeling of incomplete swallowing and address her nausea.
# Prophy - the pt was maintained on sq heparin at this hospitalization .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - Acute Rehab  Discharge Diagnosis: Atypical chest pain Nausea CAD CHF Flash pulmonary edema gout Coronary artery disease.
A fib Hypertension.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic Kidney disease Anemia secondary to renal disease and blood loss and chronic illness.
If patient complaints of any further chest pain associated with shortness of [**Name8 (MD) 1440**] please have the patient evaluated again by a physician at [**Hospital 100**] rehab or return to the emergency room.
