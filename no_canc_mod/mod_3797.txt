She presented tonight to the emergency room with 1 day of fever, dysuria, and urinary urgency.
She was in her usual state of health until yesterday when she started having chills and fevers all day.
Her daughter gave her a UTI test kit, and she came out positive so she called her doctor, who recommended she take cipro.
She denined any sick contacts, and endorsed recent change in meds to carvedilol and captopril dose adjustments only.
Per patient she c/o of some low back pain, but endorsed increase in urinary frequency.
ROS negative for CP/SOB, headache, photophobia, neck stiffness, or diarrhea (last BM yesterday, normal).
She denied new joint pain or rashes.
Labs were notable for hct of 31 (at baseline) with white count of 3.2 (slightly lower than baseline), 92.9% polys with no bands.
CXR showed no infiltrate.
Renal transplant service was contact[**Name (NI) **]; they recommended aggressive IVF and renal transplant ultrasound; this showed thick-walled bladder "in keeping with cystitis".
She was admitted to the ICU given persistent tachycardia and concern of sepsis.
Of note, patient was admitted from [**Date range (1) 20550**]/[**2160**] with fevers and chills; during this admission she was found to have E.coli bacteremia from urinary source.
Also of note during that admission, patient had labile BPs presumed from autonomic instability from her diabetes.
She was asymptomatic during these episodes and was treated with carvedilol for HTN and midodrone for low BP.

The lateral view shows increased radiodensity projecting over the lower thoracic spine that, correlated with asymmetric basal density on the frontal view, suggests left lower lobe pneumonia.
There is no pulmonary edema.
Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, without cardiomegaly.
A radiopaque object projecting over the posterior mediastinum on the lateral view is external to the patient, as no correlate is seen on frontal view.
IMPRESSION: Suggest oblique views to investigate possible left lower pneumonia.
Fullness of the ureter and renal pelvis likely reflects post-surgical status.
No frank hydronephrosis.
No renal abscess or perinephric fluid collections identified.
Patent main renal artery and main renal vein, with stable RIs compared to [**2157**].

Pt started having changed urinary symptoms recently (increased frequency) along with fevers and PCP empirically [**Name9 (PRE) 20551**] ciprofloxacin.
Pt took only one dose of cipro 500mg but fevers worsened so presented to ED.
# Fevers and leukopenia: Likely infectious in etiology, with most likely source being urinary (given borderline positive UA, cystitis on ultrasound, and patient's symptom of urinary urgency).
CXR initially raised concern for a possible LLL infiltrate; oblique films were requested for better definition and showed no evidence of PNA.
She remained normotensive and her tachycardia resolved and she received a dose of steroids in the ED over concerns for adrenal insufficiency.
She became afebrile and abx were changed to IV cipro and then PO cipro when urine culture came back negative.
It was believed that pt probably had a urinary tract infection sensitive to cipro which is why urine culture was negative as pt had taken one dose of cipro prior to presenting to ED.
Pt also stayed afebrile indicating that Abx likely treating the infection that was present.
Pt had some difficulties with night sweats but had no fever recurrence.
# Type I diabetes: Pt became hyperglycemia the morning of admission with glucose of 491.
Pt continued to have issues with elevated blood sugars while in the hospital, likely a combination of the infection and the initial stress steroids she had received.
Under [**Last Name (un) **] guidance ISS and basal insulin were slowly uptitrated although pt continued to have difficult to control blood sugars into the 300s to the day of discharge.
# Autonomic Dysfunction/Hypertension/Hypotension: Patient's BP has been stable in the ED and was initially stable on the floor.
Later in admission pt had issues with her baseline orthostatic hypotension with some blood pressures falling to 70s/40s when she stood up.
BPs would be significantly higher while lying or sitting.
# Tachycardia: Thought likely secondary to infectious process and fevers, possibly worsened by hypovolemia.
She was afebrile from midnight on during the day of admission.
