The mother had a history of cervical shortening and was treated with a cerclage.
She had spontaneous rupture of membranes at 26 weeks gestation and was treated with betamethasone at that time.
He was intubated in the delivery room secondary to poor respiratory effort.
Skin: Pink, no rashes, no lesions.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.
Due to some increased work of    breathing, a chest x-ray was obtained and he was noted to    have a right pneumothorax.
He was in room air for 4 days, but then due    to increasing episodes of apnea and bradycardia, was again    placed on continuous positive airway pressure.
His last episode of spontaneous apnea and    bradycardia occurred on [**2200-5-8**].
He has not had any other    murmurs noted during admission.
Infectious disease: Due to the prolonged rupture of    membranes and unknown group B Strep status at the time of    delivery, [**Known lastname **] was evaluated for sepsis at the time of    admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.
A blood    culture obtained prior to starting intravenous antibiotics    was no growth at 48 hours, and the antibiotics were    discontinued.
There were no other sepsis concerns during    admission.
Gastrointestinal: [**Known lastname **] required treatment for unconjugated    hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
The    second ultrasound showed a single small cyst thought to be in    the left periventricular white matter, and the most    recent head ultrasound on [**2200-5-15**] showed a similar lesion    now thought to be in the subependymal area in the caudate-    thalamic groove, most likely reflecting an evolving germinal    matrix hemorrhage.
Neither ultrsound showed significant IVH,    hydrocephalus, or PVL.
The findings are not thought to have    any long-term significance.
Ophthalmology: Eyes were examined    periodically, without signs of retinopathy.
[**Known lastname **] was    observed in his car seat for 90 minutes without any    episodes of bradycardia or oxygen desaturation.
With chronic lung disease.
Before this    age and for the first 24 months of the child's life,    immunization against influenza is recommended for household    contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Prematurity at 27-6/7 weeks gestation.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Suspicion for sepsis ruled out.
Apnea of prematurity.
