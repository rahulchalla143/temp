The infant was taken to the Neonatal Intensive Care  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed inspiratory crackles and contractures at the hip and knee, probably secondary to breech presentation.
ASSESSMENT:  Preterm male infant with respiratory distress syndrome and contractures.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  (By system)  Respiratory - The infant was initially placed on CPAP but was subsequently intubated secondary to increasing respiratory distress.
[**Known lastname 43114**] last episode of bradycardia which required stimulation and blow-by oxygen was on [**7-13**].
Those have disappeared with increasing respiratory maturation and feeding coordination.
[**Known lastname **] has developed a II/VI systolic ejection murmur since [**7-3**].
My impression was that this murmur is related to [**Known lastname 43114**] anemia and should be followed up clinically.
Infectious disease - [**Known lastname **] underwent a 48 hour rule out with ampicillin and gentamicin due to premature labor.
Subsequently [**Known lastname **] has had an expected drop in his hematocrit.
Contractures/Orthopedics - [**Known lastname **] had an extensive workup for his knee contractures.
His initial hip ultrasound showed mild right hip instability with hypermobility of the right hip joint appropriate for his prematurity.
Postoperative reflexes are equal bilaterally.
His heart examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm and a II/VI systolic ejection murmur most audible at the left upper sternal border.
[**Known lastname **] is to feed ad lib with breastmilk enriched with Enfamil powder or breastfeed.
Mild respiratory distress syndrome, resolved 3.
Positional knee and hip contractures, resolved 4.
Anemia of prematurity 5.
Hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity, resolved                                 [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 36094**], M.D.
