She denies any hematuria, change in urine output, dysuria or other urinary symptoms.
She had a non contrast CT scan [**6-17**] reviewed by our ED radiologist confirming impression which reads: "moderate left pelvocalyceal and ureteral dilation with perirenal stranding and fascial thickening.
No demonstrable ureteral calculus, limited visualization of protion of distal L ureter/UVJ.
Findings could be [**1-7**] recently passed or tiny occult calculus.
Also dilation of right renal pelvis and minimal perirenal stranding.
2.6 cm indeterminate lesion lateral aspect of right kidney."
Of note she was recently admitted at [**Hospital3 2783**] from [**2108-6-9**] - [**2108-6-14**] where she presented with hematuria and back pain.
She was followed by renal, urology and hematology and had several radiologic studies.
CT abdomen did not show any stones but did show hemorrhage in intrarenal collecting system.
She had CT urogram [**2108-6-10**] which showed "moderate hydro on right, mild hydro on L, blood in both intrarenal collecting systems, R>L, focal filling defect in proximal left interrenal collecting systmes, proximal ureter renal pelvis region measuring 9mm.
Renal U/S [**2108-6-13**] showed "the right kidney does not have hydronephrosis, echogenic material in right renal pelvis".
Past Medical History: Waldonstrom's macroglobulinemia (diagnosed [**12-12**]) episodic erosive gastritis Bilateral severe osteoarthritis of the hips spinal stenosis s/p L hip total arthroplasty in [**4-12**] Chronic anemia (iron deficiency by report with HCT drops to low 20's)   Social History: Lives at home with her husband, no tobacco for 20-30 years prior to that smoked about 1PPD for about 35 years.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS:TM 99.6 HR 115 (94-129), BP 109/50 (90/46 - 144/63)  RR 14-24 CVP 11([**8-18**])  I=8L  O = 250 HEENT: NC AT, PERRL, dry mucosa, JVP elevated at angle of jaw CV: RRR, s1 s2, no appreciable murmur Lungs: harsh crackles to [**12-7**] way bilaterally, no wheezes Abd: soft, NT, ND, BS +, no flank tenderness on exam Ext: warm, no pedal edema, DP's full bilaterally Skin: no rashes or lesions noted   Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: Na 140 K 3.9 Cl 107 HCO 19 BUN 24 Creat 1.2 Gluc 127 lactate 3.5 CK 50 MB - Trop 0.26 WBC 13.5 HCT 33.2 PLT 337 UA: trace leuk, lg blood, nitr neg, 500 protein, 0-2 WBC, few bacteria, 0-2epis  Micro: [**2108-6-17**] Blood Cultures: 4/4 bottles GNR [**2108-6-17**] Urine Cultures: no growth  Imaging: [**2108-6-17**] CXR: There is a new right IJ central venous catheter with distal lead tip in the proximal SVC.
There is no pneumothoraces.
[**2108-6-17**] Renal U/S - (dictation) mild to moderate hydronephrosis of left kidney, echogenic material in several papillae and renal pelvis, right kidney with no hydronephrosis, echogenic material in renal pelvis and several calyces, collapsed bladder with foley catheter in place.
DDX included papillary necrosis, hemorrhagic products and non-calcified stone.
[**2108-6-19**] MRI Abdomen: Limited study, but no evidence of hydronephrosis or renal obstruction.
Evidence of hemosiderosis with secondary iron deposition in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.
[**2108-6-20**] Noncontrast CT Head: (preliminary) Normal unenhanced study   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Mrs.[**Known lastname **] is a 77 yo F with PMH Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent UTI admitted with urosepsis on two pressors.
Most likely source is pyelonephritis given echogenic material in pelvices bilaterally on ultrasound.
On admission to ICU patient was oliguric bordering on anuric despite adequate CVP of [**9-16**] after getting 8L IVF and maintaining a MAP of 65 on levophed/vasopressin.
Pt also had dramatic increase in WBC count from 13 on admission to 75.3, raising suspicion that intrarenal pus accumulation secondary to pylonephritis is causing leukocytosis and oliguria via obstruction.
Goal CVP was maintained with IVF boluses of LR or sodium bicarb.
Pt underwent chest x-ray showing no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary source of infection.
MRI showed no hydronephrosis, abscess or obstruction.
However, there is some concern of abnormal structure causing obstruction per review by attending nephrologist and radiologist.
Patient was afebrile for over 48 hours.
Initial renal ultrasound reportedly concerning for papillary necrosis with most likely causes in this case being pyelonephritis, analgesics nephropathy (given longterm daily percocet use) or hypotension in the setting of sepsis.
#Altered mental status: Pt appeared disoreinted and somnolent with no focal deficits after MRI of abdomen.
Noncontrast CT was obtained showing no acute pathology.
Presentation consistent with delirium most likely induced by MRI sedation.
#Coagulopathy - elevated PT/PTT with INR at 1.6 from normal baseline likely secondary to sepsis.
Pt was evaluated for DIC secondary to sepsis.
No evidence of DIC was found.
Heme/Onc classified elevated INR and decreased platelets as a leukemoid reaction that would require no further evaluation at this time.
#Demand myocardial ischemia - with isolated bump in troponin on admission with peak of 0.26, CK and MB flat, likely due to severe hypotension in setting of sepsis.
She has no chest pain or EKG changes concerning for ACS.
Patient had mild sinus tachycardia (rate at 100) at time of discharge.
Medications on Admission: percocet 1 tab q6 hours for right hip pain for the past year   Discharge Medications: 1.
