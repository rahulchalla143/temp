There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis.
Moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild functional mitral stenosis from annular calcification.
Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with mid LAD disease.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
