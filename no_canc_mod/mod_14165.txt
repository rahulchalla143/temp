Chest CT ([**5-15**]):  Minimal hickening at the distal esophagus as it crosses the diaphragm.
No definite peri-esophageal fluid collection is seen; no significant fluid collection is seen within the esophagus.
A tiny left apical pneumothorax is stable in appearance.
A small left-sided pleural effusion and atelectasis within the left lower lobe are unchanged.
No new opacities are seen within the lungs.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was transferred from [**Hospital 26380**] Hospital with a gastrgraffin swallow and CT suggesting an esophageal rupture.
The operation itself was without complication or finding necessitate a change in preop Dx; however, during intra-op EGD, an esophageal flap was identified.
Of note, upon his transfer to the floor, the J and G tubes were reversed, such that he was getting TFs in the G and the J was to gravity; the situation was recognized and corrected with no apparent sequelae (the NGT and was removing all feeds from stomach).
On POD#8, the chest tubes were put to air seal, all PO meds were changed to the J-tube and he was freely ambulating and tolerating TFs at goal; also on this day, his intra-operative cultures came back + for Pseudomonas, and he was transitioned from Levo to cipro.
