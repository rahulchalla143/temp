Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy x2 central line placement tracheostomy G-J tube placement PRBC transfusion echocardiogram   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 106212**] is a 67 year-old gentleman with a history of HIV (last CD4 273, VL<50), as well as a history of DM type 2, CAD status post CABG and RCA stent, PVD, CRI, GERD, CHF, TIA and history of large cell lymphoma s/p chemotherapy in [**2189**], who now presents with worsening SOB and low-grade temperature.
Work-up revealed no change in brain MRI, CSF with HIV viral load improved from prior but still high.
He was last seen in clinic on [**2200-12-30**], at which time crixivan was increased and Nevirapine was added for increased CSF penetration.
According to his wife, Mr. [**Known lastname 106212**] has had mild shortness of breath for a number of weeks, with acute worsening this AM.
No history of cough, rhinorrea, or sore throat.
+ orthopnea with stable use of 3 pillows over the past week, no peripheral edema.
By the patient account, he had some left arm pain yesterday, which was relieved with NTG X 1.
This AM, he had some dull aching left-sided chest pain, but did not take NTG.
Per the wife, he frequently complains of chest pain at home, without recent acceleration of symptoms.
+ nausea over the past week, no vomiting.
No GI or GU complaints.
He developed a low-grade fever 100.8 at home this AM, and they were advised by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (ID) to present to the ED for furter evaluation.
History of large cell lymphoma (liver and periaortic Lymph nodes) s/p 6 rounds of chemotherapy in [**2189**] 5.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Hypertension 8.
CRI with history of hyperkalemia.
History of TIA [**4-/2199**] with left hemiplegia that resolved.
12. h/o resp failure requiring intubation [**7-7**] (x7 days) with "double PNA" and resp failure in [**State 33977**] in [**5-7**] 13.
Probable HIV encephalopathy  Social History: He lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 1562**].
Family History: Sister died of CAD and CVA Brother has h/o CAD Mother has h/o CAD  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITALS: T 101.2, HR 95, BP 140s/80s, RR 22, Sat 100% on NRB GEN: Emaciated man, hard of hearing, in NAD.
No respiratory distress.
NECK: JVP elevated around 6 cm ASA, no carotid bruit.
No murmur or rub.
Abdomen soft, mild tenderness to palpation, chronic per patient.
Cryptococcal antigen pending.
Elevated J point V2-3 (not new), <1mm ST depression I, II, aVL, V5-6, not new.
SINGLE VIEW CHEST, AP: There has been interval development of bilateral patchy alveolar opacities and increased interstitial opacities.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of diffuse, bilateral interstitial alveolar opacities.
These findings are consistent with left ventricular heart failure and/or multifocal pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Complex patient with HIV, CAD s/p CABG and PTCA, diastolic CHF, DM type 2, presenting with worsening SOB, low-grade temperature and nausea.
Respiratory failure: multifactorial with CAP +/- aspiration PNA and diastolic CHF contributing to presentation.
-- Pt was intubated on [**2200-2-3**] and extubated on [**2200-2-7**] then reintubated on [**2200-2-8**] due to respiratory distress.
CXR at that time demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates with thick consolidation of RUL consistent with either aspiration or worsening lobar PNA.
CXR done 2 days later showed significant clearing of infiltrates with persistent RUL consolidation, so it was felt pt had aspiration pneumonitis.
complicating the issue, he also had signs of volume overload and initially responded to diuresis.
pulmonary hemorrhage basically excluded by CT chest on [**2200-2-6**] NOT revealing pulmonary hemorrhage and anti-GBM and ANCA were negative.
He was also treated with 10 day course of vancomycin and zosyn for presumed nosocomial/vent-assoc PNA given diffuse b/l infiltrates found during hosp course after intubation.
-- Multiple sputum Cx's and BAL x 2 never yielded a pathogen [PCP (-) x 2, influenza (-)x2, [**Date Range **] (-), AFB (-), viral cultures (-)x2].
Bronchoscopy x 2 revealed minimal secretions.
-- LENIs were done x2 and no DVT found; bedside TTE on [**2200-2-8**] showed no evidence of RV failure in setting of acute decompensation -- A PA catheter was placed on [**2-12**] to better evaluate volume status given ?
diastolic dysfnx.
The patient was felt to be volume overloaded and attempts were made at diuresis, initially with nesiritide but unsuccessful and low dose lasix was administered on an as needed basis with good effect.
-- Tracheostomy performed at bedside on [**2-13**] due to failure to wean.
-- He was weaned down to PSV 10/5 and was using Passy Muir valve by time of discharge with periods of trach collar without difficulty.
-- He continued to have thick tan secretions but no abx indicated as pt afebrile.
Cultures remained negative and pt did have intermitent low grade temps spikes attributed to intermitent aspiration.
Renal Failure: likely ATN as pt was hypotensive for >20mins on admission and muddy brown casts.
however, labs were also c/w pre-renal etiology.
-- as he had +urine eos and crystals, his HAART (indinavir) was held x3 days, but no significant change occured and his ARF was not felt to be secondary to med side effects -- creatine improved and patient was able to have good post-ATN diuresis with assistance of lasix.
The etiology was likely septic +/- cardiogenic as described above.
this presentation was consistent with blood loss anemia, however, no source was discovered.
CT Chest w/o evidence of alveolar hemorrhage.
he was later found to have guaiac positive stools after he had continuous diarrhea and a rectal tube was inserted -- hemolysis labs(-) x 3.  retic 3.4% and 1.7%.
iron studies with low iron and TIBC, but elevtaed ferritin after transfusiuons- like anemia secondary to iron deficiency and chronic disease and HAART medications.
-- Mr [**Known lastname 106212**] has prevously had EGD and C-scope in [**2198**] and [**2194**] which showed gastritis but otherwise WNL.
Intubated after trial of BiPAP secondary to hypercarbia.
- Unlikely PCP given good compliance with bactrim, no recent steroids, CD4>250, negative PCP x 2 from BAL - likely has bacterial involvement (pneumococcal, staph, klebsiella, legionella) +/- volume overload - BAL x2 done neg for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], Cx.
legionella negative - last temp spike [**2200-2-24**], but thought secondary to aspirations as cultures remained negative and CXR improved.
CAD: CAD s/p CABG s/p stent [**10-6**] - no active signs of ischemia and EKG unchanged - Ruled out for MI with 3 neg CE's twice - increased trop likely secondary to ARF - FLP checked and LDL 60 - continued on asprin and [**Year (2 digits) 4532**] * 8.
Diarrhea: significant loose stools requiring placement of rectal tube.
It was the source of his non-AG acidosis.
DMII- insulin drip initially and transitioned to sliding scale insulin with [**Hospital1 **] NPH with reasonable glucose control.
FEN: there is concern for gastroparesis given that he became very distended each time TFs were given through NG tube.
-- eval by speech and swallow at bedside inconclusive as aspirated on thin liquids, but able to tolerate thich custard without difficulty.
-- reglan has been used in past with success and should be attempted if problems develop -- continue lansoprazole for reflux * 11.
