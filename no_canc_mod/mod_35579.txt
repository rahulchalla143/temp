left heart catheterization, coronary angiography   History of Present Illness: This 44 year old white male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and  recent stroke was referred for cardiac catheterization due to low EF of 20-30%.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**4-28**] with left CVA where they discovered an old anterior wall MI with a low EF.
He has no cardiac symptoms, but reports occasional parasthesias in arms and legs.

A patent foramen ovale is present with right to left flow demonstarted with agitated saline comtrast and Valsalva/release.. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the apex distal anterior, inferior, lateral and septal walls and mid anterior, anteroseptal and inferoseptal walls.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
No color flow Doppler is visualized through the interatrial septum.
No agitated saline contrast is visualized across the septum and rest or with Valsalva/release.
The LMCA was long with mild luminal irregularities.
The proximal LAD had focal calcification and was totally occluded after a high 1st diagonal branch and 1st septal branch.
The mid-distal LAD filled vial left-to-left collaterals.
The 1st diagonal branch had mild luminal irregularities.
The LCx had proximal-mid vessel tapering that culminated in a 60% stenosis before OM2.
The OM2 had mild origin  stenosis.
The RCA had diffuse disease with a 70% proximal stenosis, a 50% mid stenosis, and a 80% distal stenosis with subsequent total occlusion.
There was minimal filling iof the distal RCA, RPDA, and RPL.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 14 mmHg and LVEDP of 18 mmHg.
There was no evidence of significant right-to-left or left-to-right shunting based on oxygen saturation.
There is a persistent, though apparent decreasing opacification at the left base, consistent with effusion and atelectasis.
Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the right base medially.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel.
He was followed by serial chest films which revealed small left lower lobe effusion with atelectasis.
The foley was removed and he voided without difficulty.
His pain was well controlled with Dilaudid and motrin.
