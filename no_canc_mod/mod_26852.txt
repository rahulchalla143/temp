Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 67022**] Admission Date: [**2181-5-23**] Discharge Date: [**2181-5-27**] Date of Birth:  [**2181-5-22**] Sex:  F Service:  NB  IDENTIFICATION:  Baby Girl [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] is a 5 day old term infant being discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] NICU with a history of neonatal seizures.
Due to late fetal decelerations and a transverse lie, mother was taken for c-section.
Rupture of membranes occurred at the time of delivery, and there was no maternal fever noted.
She was brought to the NICU, where another seizure was noted, with lip smacking and generalized tonic-clonic activity.
Chest symmetrical.
No grunting, flaring, or retractions.
Generalized low tone, most likely due to phenobarb, otherwise nonfocal exam.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  RESPIRATORY STATUS: Shortly after admission, the infant did require low-flow nasal cannula oxygen due to mild desaturations, thought to be due to mild hypoventilation following the seizures and phenobarbital therapy.
This improved by 24 hours of life, and she has since remained stable in room air with comfortable respiratory status.
She has had no apnea or bradycardia.
There are no cardiovascular issues.
Of note, blood chemistries including electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous, and blood glucose were measured as part of the seizure evaluation, and these were all normal.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Initial liver function tests were measured as part of the seizure evaluation, and were mildly elevated with values of:  ALT 419, AST 390, alkaline phosphatase 120, bilirubin 4.1/0.2.
Coagulation studies were sent on [**5-23**] due to minor bleeding at the time of initial venipuncture; these were normal.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: She was started on ampicillin and gentamicin and acyclovir at the time of admission for concerns of sepsis risk factors and etiology of seizure activity.
A surface culture for HSV was also sent on [**5-25**], and this is no growth to date by the time of discharge.
She had no further seizure activity noted following the initial two episodes.
This included serum chemistries (normal), serum ammonia (normal, initial 70, repeat 45), serum lactate (mildly elevated at 4.4, likely insignificant), blood and CSF bacterial cultures (negative), CSF HSV PCR (negative), and surface HSV cultures (no growth at time of discharge).
Serum amino acids were sent, returning with minor abnormalities in glutamic acid (58, normal 62-620), glutamine (976, normal 376-709), citruline (6, normal 10-45), and leucine (43, 48-160).
Other evaluations included an EEG on [**5-23**], which showed no seizure activity and a normal background, with mildly prominent sharp waves from left side.
Although this could be indicative of early ischemic damage, it was not in the usual area of hypoxic-ischemic damage, nor was it in a vascular distribution.
