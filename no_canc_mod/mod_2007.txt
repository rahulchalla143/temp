ACUTE CARE # Staph bacteremia: The patient was found to have coag negative Staph bacteremia, as well as urinary tract infection.
He had recently been hospitalized (discharged just the day prior to admission) so possible that the source of bacteria is iatrogenic.
A TTE showed no signs of vegetation.
On the floor, the patient was seen by the infectious disease team who recommended completing a course of antibiotics for pneumonia (as discussed below) in the hospital and then switching to oral [**Date Range 11958**] on discharge to complete 4 week total [**Last Name (un) 10128**] of antibiotics for his bacteremia.
The patient was transitioned to oral [**Last Name (un) 11958**] on [**2180-9-3**] without further event and will continue [**Date Range **] for three weeks total (END DATE [**2180-9-24**]).
# Pneumonia: The patient was found to have left lower lobe infiltrate in the setting of fever and hypotension concerning for pneumonia, possibly secondary to aspiration.
Due to the patient's very poor dentition, he did meet criteria for treatment with antibiotics, and was thus treated with Flagyl.

# Bradycardia: Pt had a few brief episodes of bradycardia to high 30s/low 40s while sleeping, other vital signs normal.

- Our speech and swallow specialists felt that there was some increased risk of aspiration and recommended thin liquids, and moist, ground solids.
