The patient was evaluated and had some unusual findings with his eyes.
The pupils did react in the dark (right greater than left), and the patient did have some decreased tone in his left extremity and increased tone on his right side with upgoing toes on the left.
The Neurology team was consulted (as noted above), and the patient was taken emergently to the magnetic resonance imaging for a STAT magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography for plans to possible intervene if the patient was having a stroke.
The patient's magnetic resonance imaging was read as having no areas of restricted diffusion consistent with an infarction, but there was mild microvascular changes in the cerebral white matter which were unchanged from his [**2097**] magnetic resonance imaging.
The magnetic resonance angiography of the head had no evidence of significant stenosis with some slight motion artifact.
Otherwise, the patient had an electroencephalogram the following evening which was consistent with mild abnormality in the waking and sleeping states due to bursts of generalized slowing.
This was a very nonspecific finding but implied dysfunction in the midline structures.
Otherwise, there were no areas of prominent focal slowing, and there was no epileptiform features.
Again, and abnormal cardiac rhythm was noted.
The patient had a further neurologic workup including a tensilon test which was stopped secondary to bradycardia; however, an acetylcholine antibody receptor was sent off and was still pending at the time of this dictation.
The patient continued to have an irregularly irregular rhythm.
The patient was started on Lovenox treatment dosing until his Coumadin resulted in a therapeutic INR.
The leading diagnosis for the event was brief transient ischemic attack which had resolved by the time the patient was in the scanner.
The following day, the patient did have some increasing gas; however, after tube feeds were held and given some simethicone this resolved.
The patient did have a little bit of diarrhea with his tube feeds which was likely secondary to daily lactulose.
This can be restarted on an as needed basis for constipation.
The patient's blood pressure remained elevated at times.
The patient was unable to take nifedipine secondary to an inability to crush the tablet for administration through his gastrojejunostomy tube.
Also, the patient had a note of left upper extremity swelling medial to his elbow which was noted on [**12-10**].
The patient was scheduled for an ultrasound this extremity to rule out deep venous thrombosis; the results of which were still pending at the time of this dictation.
Otherwise, the patient had no pain and no erythema at this site, but did have some soft tissue swelling at this area.
The patient was able to sit upright without difficulties.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Transient ischemic attack.
Atrial fibrillation.
