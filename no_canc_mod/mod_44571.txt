The morning of [**3-31**] he was found unresponsive at home by his father, per EMS report at that time his blood sugar was 180 and he was given narcan with no response.
He was then taken to [**State 44256**], in the ER there he was intubated for airway protection and initially started on propofol, he was presumed to have severe hepatic encephalopathy, with an ammonia level of 560.
A head CT head done on admission was negative for any acute process, his labs were notable for a Cr of 1.5, his chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia, urine tox screen was positive for marijuana only.
He had an ultrasound of his abdomen with dopplers that was a significantly limited study that showed patent vessels, cirrhotic liver, but without identification of the main portal vein and hepatic veins, along with moderate ascites.
A KUB showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern, multiple chest x-rays without any evidence of pneumonia, just stable airspace disease at the left base.
He remained anemic and thrombocytopenic without any evidence of active bleeding.
A CT of his head and c-spine did not show any acute process.
After recieving lactulose, rifaximin and albumin his mental status had mildly improved on transfer so that he was opening his eyes and moving extremities.
Currently, the etiology of his obtundation is thought to be hepatic encephalopathy and has had prior episodes of decompensation with noncompliance with his lactulose, which his family does admit happens fairly often.

[**Name (NI) **] is single and has no kids.

#) Altered Mental Status: Patient was found down at home, no evidence of ingestion as a cause, no obvious ingestion, no evidence of active infection initially.
He was started on aggressive treatment of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin.
Head CT on admission at the OSH was negative, no evidence of GIB or SBP.
Patient's mental status improved on treatment for hepatic encephaloapthy.
TTE was negative for endocarditis and surveillance bld cxs were all NGTD.
Perhaps could have been from intubation as patient did not have any oral procedures recently.
Afebrile during admission.
#) HCV/Etoh Cirrhosis: There was no evidence of decompensation during this admissin.
Patient also had a couple of paracentesis for worsening ascites.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 110187**],  You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] because of confusion due to hepatic encephalopathy.
Due to this you were initially intubated and requiried a breathing machine but after treatment you quickly improved and were extubated.
During your admission we found that you had bacteria growing in your blood and started you on an antibiotic called cefazolin.
MEDICATION CHANGES: START: Rifaxamin 550 mg twice a day START: Cefazolin 2 g every 8 hours via provided pump until [**4-16**]  No other changes were made to your medications.
