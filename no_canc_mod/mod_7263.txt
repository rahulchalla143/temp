HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old woman with congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 20% to 25%), chronic atrial fibrillation, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, severe peripheral vascular disease (with several right lower extremity bypass surgeries) who was recently admitted to the Vascular Service at the [**Hospital1 69**] for worsening right lower extremity ischemia that was treated conservatively with antibiotics (Zosyn), dressing changes, and pain management.
Cardiology Service followed the patient and adjusted medications for volume overload and blood pressure management.
At the rehabilitation facility ([**Location (un) **]), on the day of admission, the patient complained of shortness of breath with an oxygen saturation of 75% on room air which increased to 90% with 2 liters nasal cannula.
There was also a question of low blood pressures, and the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital where oxygen saturations were noted to be 79% on room air, which improved to 93% with 2 liters; however, the respiratory rate was 34.
A chest x-ray performed at the outside facility showed questionable right upper lobe consolidation and congestive heart failure.
The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Room with continued shortness of breath and an oxygen saturation of 86% to 100% on 4 liters which improved to 98%.
The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate into the 110s and 120s and a blood pressure of 100/60 which dropped to 84/56.
In the Emergency Department, the patient became more alert with an elevation of her blood pressure as the patient was able to speak in full sentences as opposed to one-word answers, and a noted right eyelid drop had resolved at this time.
The patient's heart rate was noted to become elevated into the 150s in the Emergency Department; and, therefore, intravenous Cardizem 5 mg was given times two with a decrease in heart rate to the 120s to 130s.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient complained of thirst and discomfort with swallowing.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (with neuropathy).
Mitral valve regurgitation.
Peripheral vascular disease; status post right lower extremity bypass times four with the latest in [**2139-11-17**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Echocardiogram in [**2140-1-15**] showed left atrial dilatation with moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, an ejection fraction of 20% to 25%, with global hypokinesis, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, 1+ aortic regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The oropharynx with petechiae on posterior oropharynx and some exudate on the tongue and buccal mucosa.
The neck was supple with right internal jugular in place.
Cardiovascular examination revealed irregularly irregular and tachycardic.
The chest revealed decreased breath sounds at the right base with crackles halfway up bilaterally.
Lower extremity edema of 1+ up to the knees bilaterally and dry gangrene over the right foot and lower extremity.
Urinalysis revealed 0 to 2 red blood cells, 0 white blood cells, no bacteria or yeast.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed right effusion with mild congestive heart failure, middle right upper lobe consolidation with questionable left retrocardiac consolidation.
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 118, left axis deviation, with a left bundle-branch block, ST elevations of 1 mm in leads V2, ST depressions of 1 mm in V5 through V6 (which were slightly more pronounced than prior electrocardiograms).
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient's initial hypotension was thought to be secondary to sepsis with an element of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
The patient was also started on broad spectrum antibiotics given the possible diagnosis of sepsis secondary to pneumonia and a right gangrenous leg.
Once the patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit (on [**2140-11-19**]), it was unclear what the patient's intravascular volume status was given evidence of rales on pulmonary examination and elevated jugular venous pressure; however, a fractional secretion of sodium was found to be less than 1%, and the patient was complaining of thirst.
However, there was minimal responsiveness to these normal saline intravenous fluid boluses.
The catheter readings did show a cardiac index of 0.8 to 1.1, and a central venous pressure of 12 to 16, and elevated pulmonary artery pressures of 50/20, and a systemic vascular resistance of 2424 to 3677.
However, on [**11-27**], diuresis had to be held since the patient's systolic blood pressure became borderline hypotensive at 96.
In terms of the patient's atrial fibrillation, the patient did experience episodes of rapid ventricular response into the 140s and 150s.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was noted to have a multilobar pneumonia on chest x-ray as well as a right gangrenous leg.
The patient remained afebrile, and her white blood cell count remained stable.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient was noted to have a right large pleural effusion on chest x-ray which was stable from a prior chest x-ray in [**2140-10-16**].
The patient, as well as the patient's family, expressed that no invasive diagnostic procedures be performed.
A chest computed tomography was done which revealed a large right pleural effusion, and moderate left pleural effusion, with a small pericardial effusion, and less than 3-mm nodules in the lung parenchyma.
There was evidence of likely hydrostatic edema, but lymphangitic carcinomatosis could not be excluded.
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE:  The patient was noted to have a right dry gangrenous leg and foot.
The right amputation of the lower leg was cancelled for now, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will continue to follow the patient to determine if it should be rescheduled.
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY SWELLING:  The patient was noted to have asymmetric right upper extremity swelling on [**2140-11-27**].
A right upper extremity ultrasound was performed in order to rule out a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis; the results of which were pending at the time of this dictation.
