Admission Date:  [**2146-4-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-4-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-12-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12174**] Chief Complaint: Variceal bleed stabilized at OSH, TIPS occluded and transferred for TIPS revision  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement  TIPS revision   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 52412**] is a 50yo man with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS in [**1-31**], TIPS redo by IR in [**6-1**] at OSH and again [**1-1**] here.
EGD showed gastric bleeding most likely secondary to gastric varices.
On ROS, he c/o diarrhea.
Past Medical History: - HepC w/ cirrhosis - complicated by variceal bleeds s/p banding.
- TIPS placement [**1-31**] with redo [**6-1**], another balloon dilation [**1-1**] - hepatic encephalopathy - carpel tunnel syndrome - h/o recurrent cellulitis - obesity - mild COPD by PFTs - diverticulosis - chronic low back pain [**2-26**] disk protrusion - depression - h/o substance abuse   Social History: Lives with his sister.
Family History: No history of liver problems.
Physical Exam: 99.2 130/71 80 16 96/3L HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, MMM, no LAD Neck: supple, mo thyromegaly Heart: RRR, no M/R/G, nl S1 S2 Lungs: CTAB Abd: soft, obese, NT/ND, no HSM, BS +, no ascites Extr: 2+ pitting edema b/l, right arm with swelling in hand, forearm and arm TTP, no erythema or warmth Neuro: AAO x 3. no asterixis.
no focal neuro deficit   Pertinent Results: [**4-17**] TIPS revision  IMPRESSION: 1.
Moderate new intimal hyperplasia and stenosis at the hepatic venous end of the TIPS, clearly flow limiting, with a post balloon angioplasty persitent portosystemic gradient of 14 mmHg.
Given the persistently elevated gradient and the presence of large varices as well as the moderate but clearly flow-limting proximal stenosis, an additional 10 mm Wallstent was deployed, with subsequent balloon angioplasty of the stent and good angiographic results.
Plan: The bleeding risk should be eliminated at the current time.
Careful ultrasonogrphic imaging is recommended, the TIPS is at risk of failure given the presence of multiple stents [**4-18**] u/s  IMPRESSION: 1.
This represents a new baseline with markedly increased TIPS velocity.
[**4-19**] u/s  IMPRESSION: Limited examination due to body habitus.
Patent TIPS with velocities ranging from 132-140 cm/sec d/c labs  [**2146-4-23**] 04:10AM BLOOD WBC-3.2* RBC-2.82* Hgb-8.3* Hct-24.9* MCV-89 MCH-29.4 MCHC-33.2 RDW-15.9* Plt Ct-39*  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 50yo man with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS p/w GIB to OSH.
Found to have TIPS occluded.
# Variceal bleed due to TIPS occlusion  As per OSH d/c summary, most likely from variceal bleed.
HCT stable for several days, patient discharged with stable hematocrit and no signs of further bleeding.
# HCV Cirrhosis  HCV cirrhosis.
recent note from Dr [**Name (NI) 32282**] talks about starting rx w/ pegylated inteferon and ribavirin.
Refractory ascites s/p TIPS with multiple revisions and at high risk for further occlussion given multiple stents placed.
Continued lasix and aldactone to manage ascites and peripheral edema.
S/p band ligation of varices, h/o recurrent variceal bleeding, restarted nadolol.
Disp:*3 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Variceal bleed  Secondary: Hep C Cirrhosis COPD Hepatic encephalopathy   Discharge Condition: Stable.
ambulating well, cleared by PT   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a variceal bleed requiring TIPS revision for narrowing of the stent.
You need to complete 1 more day of antibiotics and you were started on nadolol 20mg daily to help prevent any further episodes of variceal bleeding.
If you have any bloody vomit, blood in stool, fainting, shortness of breath, abdominal pain or any worrisome symptoms present to the ER immediately for evaluation.
