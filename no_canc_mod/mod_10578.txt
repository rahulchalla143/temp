Patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post recent admission to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for pneumonia complicated by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation on a prednisone taper.
She was witnessed to have three generalized tonic-clonic seizures lasting approximately 20 minutes.
Head CT revealed diffuse white matter disease with evidence of edema, but no bleed.
Lumbar puncture was slightly bloody, although decreased white count from tubes one through four.
Patient had been treated for a urinary tract infection with Bactrim and was noted to have a zoster rash on her back, which was noted at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital.
CT scan was reviewed with Radiology and felt not to be consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Possible multifocal atrial tachycardia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Congestive heart failure.
ALLERGIES:  Patient has no known drug allergies.
No doll's eyes.
Oropharynx showed ETT in place.
Her heart was irregularly irregular with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Electrocardiogram shows sinus arrhythmia with ST elevations in V1 and V2 and nonspecific ST-T wave changes.
Head CT demonstrated white matter disease, left cerebral edema with compression of the lateral ventricle, no gross shift, question of air bubbles.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**Hospital **] hospital course can best be summarized day to day as her main problems were her neurologic problems and pulmonary problems and these were overlapping issues.
The patient's work-up at [**Hospital1 **] included an MRI of her head which showed diffuse cerebral edema.
MRA and MRV were normal and electroencephalogram showed frontal spike on the left with a diffusely slow background.
Follow-up MRIs did not demonstrate progression and in fact showed resolution of her cerebral edema.
It is felt to be positive for her aseptic meningitis or asymptomatic shedding from a sacral nerve root.
Facial sensation was difficult to assess, motion was noted to be decreased in her lower face on the right side.
Head turning and shoulder shrug were difficult to assess.
Sensory examination showed that the patient was capable of localizing painful stimuli.
She had no tremors.
Repeat MRI showed some regression of the T2 hyperintensity white matter changes, especially in the centrum semiovale and a possible increase in cerebral blood flow.
On [**3-17**], she was suctioned aggressively for several episodes of desaturation.
On [**3-18**], the patient had no significant shortness of breath.
A rash was noted for the first time.
It is felt to be consistent with Dilantin Infatabs rash.
The Infatabs were changed back to the regular formulation and the rash slowly, but incompletely resolved.
On [**3-19**], the patient was noted to have several desaturations which responded to aggressive suctioning.
The patient on the morning of [**3-25**] was noted to have decreased oxygen saturations.
She was left in no apparent distress at that time on oxygen by shovel mask.
The patient developed decreased oxygen saturations at 5:30 a.m. on [**3-26**].
She had no heart sounds, no breath sounds, no spontaneous movements, no response to pain, no radial or femoral pulses.
Patient did not have any seizures during this hospitalization.
