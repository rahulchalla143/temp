Pertinent Results:    URINE CULTURE (Final [**2149-12-11**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
CT Torso: TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without oral or intravenous contrast due to the patient's acute renal failure.
NON-CONTRAST CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There is a 20-mm low-density lesion within segment VIII/VII of the liver (3:16), which is nonspecific and cannot be further evaluated on this non-contrast CT. Sludge layers within the gallbladder.
The adrenal glands, spleen, and intra-abdominal small and large bowel loops are normal.
There are 3 prominent mesenteric lymph nodes, measuring up to 16 mm in short axis.
There is a tiny high- density focus within the lower pole of the right kidney which may represent milk of calcium or a prominent papilla.
There are no definite renal calculi and no calculi seen along the courses of the ureters bilaterally.
Exam for renal abscess is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
However, there are no secondary signs, such as contour abnormality or perinephric stranding.
There is a 16 mm simple cyst arising from the lower pole of the left kidney with sparse calcifications.
There is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
Very mild anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 is noted.
There is also a hemangioma replacing the L1 vertebral body.
No evidence of renal or ureteral calculi and no hydronephrosis.
Evaluation of the renal abscesses is limited due to lack of IV contrast, however, there are no secondary signs of renal abscess.
No intra-abdominal abscess.
18 mm hypoattenuating lesion within the liver is difficult to characterize in this non-contrast CT.
Diagnostic considerations include a cyst or small abscess, for which ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent basis.
Gallbladder sludge, without CT evidence of cholecystitis.
Left renal cystic lesion with sparse calcification - a 6 month follow-up ultrasound is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo F with a history of mild dementia, recent diagnosis of herpes zoster V1 distribution, and HTN who presented with delerium.
# Altered mental status: Pt had been recently been evaluated at [**Hospital1 2025**] for a facial rash that was reportedly diagnosed as herpes zoster and started on course of valtrex 5 days prior to admission.
She was in acute renal failure up to Creatinine of 4.5 from baseline of 0.8.
Head CT without acute pathology, CT abd/pelvis without hydronephrosis, intra-abdominal abscesses, signs of pyelo but exam limited as no IV contrast given.
While in the ICU, the pt was continued on cipro to cover for UTI and IV acyclovir to cover for potential HSV/VZV meningitis.
Her mental status gradually improved with resolution of her ARF and treatment of her UTI as per below.
She was instructed to maintain hydration while taking her valtrex so as not to have recurrent renal failure.
# Sepsis due to E Coli UTI/Urinary tract infection: Grew pansensitive E Coli.
# Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 0.6 - 0.8 with most recent Cr in [**9-24**] 0.8.
Cr peaked at 4.3, likely due to septicemia vs. medication effect from acyclovir.
Her benzapril will be held until follow up with her PCP and completion of her valtrex course.
No hyperemia of eye noted and pt denies any blurry vision or eye pain.
Pt had already been seen by optho at [**Hospital1 2025**] and had no visual complaints while here.
# L renal cyst: 6 month f/u u/s recommended .
# Liver lesion: 18 mm hypoattenuating lesion within the liver is difficult to characterize on non-contrast CT.
Diagnostic considerations include a cyst or small abscess, for which ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent basis .
# Dementia: Reportedly mild at baseline.
As of discharge son felt pt was back to 75% of her baseline.
# HTN: Continued norvasc.
Benzapril was held in the setting of acute renal failure, likely from acyclovir.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type II, uncontrolled, no complications: New diagnosis.
Pt has had elevated levels of glucose.
She carries no diagnosis of diabetes.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Urinary tract infection E Coli septicemia Acute renal failure Herpes Zoster Delerium Diabetes Mellitus Type II   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a urinary tract infection and confusion.
You were treated with IV antivirals for the herpes zoster on your face, as well as antibiotics for your urinary tract infection.
You also had kidney failure felt to be due to medications you were on.
This medication can cause nausea and diarrhea, but often gets better over time.
You also will need an ultrasound of your liver to further delineate a small lesion noted on the liver on CT scan.
Call your doctor or return to the ER for worsening confusion, pain with urination, dehydration, visual changes or pain, facial pain, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms.
