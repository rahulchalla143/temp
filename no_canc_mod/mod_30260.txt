There are low lung volumes.
Bibasilar opacities left greater than right are consistent with atelectasis.
There is mild vascular congestion.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is partially due to the projection and low lung volumes.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.
This could be due to an enlarged thyroid.
There are persistent low lung volume.
Mild interstitial edema has minimally improved.
Right mid lung opacity has resolved consistent with resolved atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Bibasilar atelectases with trace pleural effusions bilaterally.
Centrilobular emphysema.
[**10-17**] CXR PA-L: IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
: New mild prevertebral soft tissue swelling, likely postsurgical.
No acute fracture.
Her post-operative course was complicated by a new O2 requirement (low 90s on 4L NC on call-out) due to decompensated dCHF in the setting of COPD, low grade post-op fever to 100.5, delerium, typical CP ruled out for MI, and sinus tachycardia likely due to pain, ruled for PE.
# Cervical spine decompression and fusion: See [**2110-10-13**] operative report for details.
Use of allograft for instrumentation, as well as autograft.5.
Placement of [**Location (un) 8766**] head holder for axial spinal stabilization.
# Post-operative hypoxia due decompensated dCHF: Patient admitted with known diastolyic dysfunction according to previous ECHO from 9/[**2108**].
Post-operatively she became hypervolemic due to IVF and was transferred in respiratory distress on NRB to the MICU for close monitoring and diuresis; CXR at that time was equivocal for possible infiltrate and the patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible CA-PNA.
In the ICU, the patient complained of typical chest pain; EKG showed no ischemic changes and serial cardiac enzymes were flat; ECHO was unchanged from previous study.
# Post-operative fever: On the floor the patient was taken off of antibiotics in the absence of any clinical sequellae of PNA - no cough, fever, or leukocytosis; her fever was attributed to post-operative atelectacis and she defervesced off of antibiotics.
# Post-operative sinus tachycardia concerning for PE: The patient remained persistently tachycardic the first day on the floor in the setting of hypoxia, requiring 4L NC to maintain sats in the low 90s, satting low 80s on RA.
Given her moderate modified [**Location (un) 20872**] pre-test proability, she was ruled out for PE with a negative CTPA.
# Diabetes mellitus: Controlled on HISS and restarted on home oral hypoglycemics prior to discharge EXCEPT for metformin, which was held in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **].
# Post-operative pain: Pain was controlled on the floor with 1g acetaminophen QID, oxycontin, and oxycodone.
# Post-operative delerium: In the ICU patient was noted to be oriented x 1 or x 2 and thought to be delerious.
# OSA: In process of being worked up, pt currently on 2L O2 at home at night but not on PPV.
# Correctopic Pupil OD (Right Eye): Ophthalmology consulted and noted the abnormality was due to an anterior chamber intraocular lens implanted after cataract extraction.
# Bipolar Disorder: Maintained on pre-admission meds without changes; buproprion 150mg daily, and lamotrigine 200mg daily.
# CODE: DNR but ok to intubate per discussion with patient and daughter .
