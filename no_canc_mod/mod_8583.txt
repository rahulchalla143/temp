Admission Date:  [**2136-9-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2136-9-7**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80 year-old white male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, myocardial infarction times three with recent stent placement, congestive heart failure (with a recent admission), ICD placed (complicated by ventricular tachycardia), end stage renal disease secondary to FSGS on hemodialysis three times a week, prostate cancer, hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia who was initially transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from an outside hospital with pleuritic chest pain that was not relieved with nitroglycerin, but was relieved with Toradol.
The patient had a recent admissions for congestive heart failure the first being secondary to ICD firing and stent restenosis status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and hemodialysis and the second being for flash pulmonary edema on [**8-21**] and cardiac catheterization was negative for new lesion at that time.
The patient complained of mild nausea.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction times three, status post stent times two.
Ventricular tachycardia status post ICD placement.
End stage renal disease secondary to FSGS and hemodialysis three times a week.
Left AV fistula on [**9-/2133**].
History of superficial thrombophlebitis in [**2135-2-21**].
Deep venous thrombosis status post thrombectomy in [**2092**] in the left lower extremities.
The patient was in no acute distress.
Bibasilar crackles.
Left AV fistula, left arm AV fistula with bruit.
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45%, mild pulmonary hypertension.
Chest x-ray showed stable cardiac enlargement, upper zone redistribution without overt pulmonary edema, persistent left lower lobe opacity (pneumonia versus atelectasis).
CTA showed bibasilar atelectasis, resolution of bilateral pleural effusions and diffuse ground glass opacities, residual thickening reflex, residual mild pulmonary edema, no PE.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 80 year-old male with coronary artery disease status post stent placement with ICD and end stage renal disease on hemodialysis who is transferred from outside hospital with pleuritic chest pain.
He has cardiac enzymes negative times three for an myocardial infarction.
CTA was negative for PE and echocardiogram showed ejection fraction of 45%, mildly depressed left ventricular function, mildly thickened aortic valve and mitral valve, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, no effusion.
A repeat echocardiogram was done to rule out new effusion.
A physiologic effusion was noted.
Etiology of chest pain unclear.
Possible gastrointestinal etiology.
Hypotension:  In the Emergency Department the patient became hypotensive to a systolic blood pressures of 83 and he was started on a Dopamine drip and a right IJ was placed and intravenous fluids were given.
Cause of hypotension is unclear.
Chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia.
Urinary tract infection:  The patient with a history of staph epididymis urinary tract infection in the past.
During this hospitalization his urine was positive for staph epididymis.
Loose stools:  The patient had multiple episodes of loose stools and C-difficile culture was sent and it was negative.
Transient hypotension requiring Dopamine drip.
Urinary tract infection with coag negative staph.
Coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction times three with stents placed.
Congestive heart failure ICD placed.
History of ventricular tachycardia.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
History of urinary tract infection with coag negative staph.
