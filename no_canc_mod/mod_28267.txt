Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 64953**] Admission Date: [**2147-11-14**] Discharge Date: [**2147-11-14**] Date of Birth:  [**2147-11-14**] Sex:  F Service:  NB   IDENTIFICATION:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 5661**] is a newborn 37-5/7 week infant with a large omphalocele who is being transferred to the [**Hospital3 1810**].
Maternal history was notable for a prior early pregnancy loss and treatment with aspirin this pregnancy.
This pregnancy was complicated by diagnosis of a giant omphalocele on first trimester ultrasound.
There was no labor or fever and membranes were intact at time of delivery.
General: A vigorous infant in moderate respiratory distress, somewhat improved after brief facial CPAP.
Abdomen soft with a large omphalocele at the umbilicus with an intact sac.
Omphalocele appears to contain mostly liver with some portion of intestines in the lower half.
The base of the omphalocele is somewhat smaller than most of the mass itself.
A three vessel umbilical cord comes off the inferior aspect of the omphalocele.
IMPRESSION:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 5661**] is a 37-5/7 week newborn infant with a large omphalocele prenatally diagnosed.
No other anomalies known by prenatal imaging or evident on current physical examination.
Moderate respiratory distress is noted and this is likely transitional related to retained fetal lung fluid although some element of HMD or compression from the abdominal mass may also be contributing.
Omphalocele was supported with additional blankets to avoid twisting or turning.
