As per notes, it appears no specific seizure activity was witnessed, but it was thought by EMS that the patient was post-ictal.
Wife died [**12-12**], patient has [**Last Name (un) 6550**] saddened and extremely anxious.
Tobacco - remote EtOH - unknown Drug use - denied by family  Family History: CAD, HTN, DM  Physical Exam: On admission:  VS; BP 111/63 P 78 RR 16 100% on vent, afebrile General: intubated, sedated.
Obese, mildly disheveled middle-aged male.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, atraumatic.
Neck: c-collar in place Pulmonary: Lungs CTA anteriorly Cardiac: RRR, distant S1,S2, no murmurs Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Cranial Nervies; Pupils 2mm and minimally reactive.
[**4-5**] CSF - Bacterial cultures negative.
Rounded lesion in the superior right orbit, inseparable from the ophthalmic vasculature on the right, likely representing an aneurysm  MRI/A/V brain [**4-3**]:  IMPRESSION:  1.
Small right superior parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage, which could be post-traumatic in the setting of the associated right parietal subgaleal hematoma.
Mild chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
No evidence of central intracranial aneurysms.
Please note that the location of the patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage is not included on the MRA of the head.
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
Bulbous lesion in the right orbit, intimately associated with the superior ophthalmic vein, which most likely represents a venous aneurysm.
A cystic schwannoma or a hemangioma would be much less likely.
Further evaluation could be obtained by either a CT venogram or a dedicated MRI of the orbits.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No definite regional wall motion abnormality seen.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
No evidence of vertebral body bone marrow edema, ligamentous edema, paraspinal soft tissue edema, or other acute traumatic injuries.
Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament from C3 through C6, indenting the spinal cord and causing moderate spinal canal stenosis, worst at C5 and C6.
No evidence of associated cord signal abnormality.
Moderate-to-severe neural foraminal narrowing at C3-4.
Moderate neural foraminal narrowing at C6-7.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism, noting the limitation of superimposed opacities obscuring lower lobe subsegmental vessels somewhat.
Multifocal opacities in the lungs with pleural effusions.
The appearance is suspected to represent a combination or pneumonic consolidations (particularly in the right upper lobe) and extensive atelectasis.
Follow-up chest CT is recommended to show resolution in several months if clinically appropriate given the mass-like apppearance of a consolidative opacity in the right upper lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: 62-year-old male with history of HTN, DM, HLD, found down in Stop and Shop this afternoon after unwitnessed event, presumed to be post-ictal upon arrival by EMS.
He presented to outside hospital with GCS 10 and found to have a right parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
MRI/A/V of head was obtained and showed no VST, AVM as causes of SAH, but did reveal a R subgaleal hematoma.
No infarction or vessel abnormalities in vessels of COW and neck.
BP was maintained to goal of < 160, however, due to significant patient agitation at times would reach nearly 180 systolic.
Patient was extubated on HD2, however remained extremely agitated and required use of Haldol, ativan, zyprexa and Precedex to prevent self harm.
Due to agitation, he underwent periodic episodes of hypertension and tachycardia.
LP was performed to assess for etiology of agitation and was negative.
Etiology of agitation was felt to be due to ICU delerium.
His neurologic exam on day of discharge was significant for normal mental status, normal cranial nerve exam, muscle strength full throughout, and slight pronator drift on the right.
On HD2, patient was noted to have worsening hypoxemia and require NRB in setting of elevated BPs during agitation (SBPs to 190s).
He developed flash pulmonary edema clincially and was noted to have troponin/CK but not MB elevations (see above).
EKG showed RV strain and ECHO showed no WMA w/ EF 60% and RV borderline function.
Lasix was used for diuresis, however, due to persistent agitation and hypoxemia, he required reintubation on [**4-5**], sedated w/ propofol requiring general anesthesia levels.
CTA was performed to r/o PE and was negative, revealing however pulmonary edema and b/l effusions.
There was no evidence of PNA and patient remained afebrile.
No fevers developed.
Blood culture on [**2113-4-7**] grew gram positive rods.
He remained afebrile without leukocytosis throughout.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Admission Diagnosis: Subarachnoid hemorrhage Secondary Diagoses: -HTN -diabetes -HLD -CAD -Anxiety   Discharge Condition: His neurologic exam on day of discharge was significant for normal mental status, normal cranial nerve exam, muscle strength full throughout, and slight pronator drift on the right.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with a fall and a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.
It was unclear why you had fallen, however you were ruled out for infection, seizures and other etiologies.
While hospitalized you had remarkable episodes of agitation leading to elevated blood pressures and cardiac stress leading to enzyme leakage but no heart attack.
Should you develop any symptoms as listed below or concerning to you, please call your doctor or go to the emergncy room.
