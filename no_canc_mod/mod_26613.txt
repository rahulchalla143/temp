Initially hypotensive in the ED, afebrile, thought sepsis of unclear source started on dopamine and vasopressin also given linezolid and zosyn.
Patient also with positive troponin thought to be NSTEMI in setting of demand ischemia.
Patient also taekn off linezolid after no source identified.
Anemia Post operative Atrial fibrillation h/o GI bleed hperlipidemia GERD  Social History: retired stock broker, widowed, smoking history unknon, etoh unknown.
HEENT: PERRL, no scleral icterus noted, MMM Neck: supple Pulmonary: Lungs CTAB Cardiac: RRR, nl.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color  Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to  moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis  and hypokinesis of the infero-septum and infero-lateral walls.
No masses or  thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly  thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**12-21**]+) aortic  regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial  effusion.
Due to the presence of the endotracheal tube and inflated bulb, it is impossible to evaluate for subglottic stenosis or or larynx.
There is a band-like structure noted along the posterior aspect of the distal trachea beyond the tip of the endotracheal tube (series 401B, image 30), which could be due to a web.
Evidence of bilateral lung disease, incompletely evaluated on the present CT scan.
Evidence of degenerative changes involving the cervical and thoracic vertebral bodies in the form of osteophytes and facet joint degeneration.
Status post CABG.Degenerative changes are also noted in bilateral sternoclavicular joints and distal ends of the clavicles.
As the patient is intubated with inflated bulb of the ETT, it is impossible to assess for subglottic or laryngeal stenosis.
Recommend direct visualization for assessment.
Degenerative changes noted involving the cervical and thoracic spine, bilateral sternoclavicular joints.
(The case was discussed with the chest radiology team by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], regarding the possibility of better assessment on CT chest per tracheal stenosis protocol.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 with history of recent CABG, MV repair admitted to outside hospital for hypotension after being found down, concerning for sepsis.
Patient was transferred to us for tracheal stenosis management.
# Respiratory failure/tracheal stenosis Patient was intubated on arrival.
He developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was promptly re-intubated.
