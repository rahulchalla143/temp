HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 44432**] is a 70-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hospital the night of [**2183-1-24**] complaining of generalized fatigue, acute shortness of breath, and recent increased peripheral edema.
There she was found to be in congestive heart failure and a blood sugar to be 600.
Electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed ST depressions in I and aVL, and ST elevations in V1 and V2.
Over the last evening prior to the catheterization, the patient developed significant epistaxis requiring discontinuation of her 2B3A inhibitor and Heparin.
Subsequently, she became hypotensive in the Cardiac Catheterization Waiting Room, and developed new ST elevations.
She was taken to cardiac catheterization, where she was found to have severe three vessel disease.
She was also found to have a cold left foot and found to have thrombus of her left iliac artery which was thrombectomized.
During the procedure, the patient developed cardiogenic shock and bradycardic at that point, and intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted, and she was started on dopamine drip.
Upon arrival to the CCU, she was found to have a cold, white right foot, and was taken back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory to rule out ischemia.
At that point, balloon pump was switched from her right to her left side, and she was found to have diffuse disease in her right lower extremity.
LUNGS:  Diffuse rhonchi bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles.
There is 1+ pitting edema on the left, and trace on the right.
LABORATORY DATA AND STUDIES:  Patient had first cardiac catheterization:  Three vessel disease, left anterior descending artery with a 70% proximal lesion, 60% mid vessel lesion, 80% distal lesion, first diag was 60% lesion, left circumflex was occluded and filled with collaterals to left anterior descending artery.
There is a large thrombus in the left common iliac vein, and it was thrombectomized and a stent placed to the external common iliac arteries, but the left internal iliac was jailed, and not stented.
She had diffuse disease in her left superficial femoral artery and markedly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
She was found to have a right common femoral artery with mild disease, a superficial femoral artery on the right with severe disease, and total occlusion at the adductor canal and anterior tibialis a anteriors the sole artery to her foot which did not fill.
On her left side, she had a superficial femoral artery severe disease that was diffuse.
Her urinalysis showed large blood, trace protein, traced ketones, and 6 red blood cells.
She had a chest x-ray on the 8th, which showed mild congestive heart failure.
She had an echocardiogram which showed a mildly dilated left atrium, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, an ejection fraction of roughly 25%, and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Her electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 120, normal axis, and left bundle pattern upon arrival.
Cardiovascular:  The patient arrived at the CCU in cardiogenic shock with an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
Initially of interest, the patient was started on dopamine to which she had a correspondence in regards to a low SVR and she was switched to Neo-Synephrine which had a better response in maintaining her blood pressure more adequately.
It is noted that she had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and had a stent to her right coronary artery.
She has three vessel disease, but it did not appear amenable to further percutaneous or surgical revasculariztaion.
Peripheral vascular disease:  The patient has extensive peripheral vascular disease in both extremities.
She had acute thrombosis of the left common iliac artery which per Vascular is due to a local reaction from the vessel wall and not embolism of the heart.
She subsequently developed drop in her platelets which was initially thought to be due to Heparin induced thrombocytopenia, HIT antibodies which were negative, and after Hematology was consulted, and they suggested it is not heparin induced thrombocytopenia but rather platelet destruction from the intra-aortic balloon pump.
However, in the interim, she was changed over to Argatroban which she tolerated well for anticoagulation.
When the balloon pump was discontinued, the patient was restarted on Heparin drip for her peripheral vascular disease in the attempt and plan to transition her to Coumadin for anticoagulation for the peripheral vascular disease.
