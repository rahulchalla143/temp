This vessel likely represents vessel in an ulcer base, and less likely a duodenal varix.
(injection, thermal therapy)  Abd U/S [**8-22**]: Hepatic cirrhosis with secondary findings of portal hypertension including splenomegaly, ascites, and patent umbilical vein.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 year-old man with PMHx of etoh cirrhosis transferred to MICU after developing GIB and noted to have acute anemia, leukocytosis and elevated INR.
# GIB: Patient presented with abdominal distention and BRB on toilet paper.
He was found to be hypotensive and with a Hct of 17 from 30 on admission.
He was transfered to the MICU where he was intubated for airway protection and underwent EGD and was found to have a visible vessel that was thought to be either a variceal or a vessel within a duodenal ulcer.
He was hypotensive during periods of acute bleeding and required IVFs to maintain his blood pressure.
On the floor patient had about 4 episodes of small amount of BRBPR that resolved on [**8-26**].
Flex Sigmoidoscopy showed internal hemorrhoids and rectal ulcer, not actively bleeding, but with brown stool above.
BRBPR improved over the next 2 days without intervention with intermittant BRBPR with BM's.
# Acute kidney injury: Patient's renal function worsened acutely as a result of his massive UGIB.
This was thought to be due to both ATN, in the setting of hypoperfusion of the kidneys, and a possible component of HRS.
# Leukocytosis: Patient had an elevated WBC on admission of 16, that was thought to be due to his ESLD initially.
After his massive UGIB his WBC increased even more to a  high of 23.
He was started empirically on Zosyn for SBP in the setting of this leukocytosis.
# EtOH Hepatitis/Cirrhosis: Patient has hx of alcoholic cirrhosis with grade 1 varices, last drink 1 month prior to presentation.
His presentation was consistent EtOH hepatitis with Tbili 37 and INR 1.9.
He was initially treated with prednisone but only received one dose as he developed an UGIB on the night of admission.
As a result of his ESLD he developed large tense ascites and underwent IR guided medium volume paracentesis where they took out 3.5L.
Flex sigmoidoscopy revealed internal hemorrhoids and rectal ulcers with brown stool above, so this was sufficient to account for the bleeding.
Mr. [**Known lastname 24049**] was to have outpatient lab work and follow-up in the Liver Center for determination of steroid taper after the one-month course.
Ursodiol 300 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for itching.
Alcholic Hepatitis 2.
Duodenal Ulcer vs. Duodenal Varices with Upper GI bleed 3.
Respiratory Failure 5.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to blood in your stool and worsening abdominal distension.
Your bleeding became severe while you were in the hospital and you were transferred to the intesive care unit (ICU).
While in the ICU, they looked in your stomach and intestine and found a bleeding vessel in the first part of your intestine.
You required blood products due to your massive blood loss.
Additionally, medicines were given to get excess fluid out of your body.
This should improve over time, however if you continue to drink, you will likely experience repeat bleeding episodes that you may die from.
If you drink again, there is a high likelihood that you would die.
If you dont, there is a high chance that you will become very confused.
Changes in Medication: CHANGE Ursodiol 300 mg by mouth to three times daily (was twice daily) CHANGE Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth to twice daily (was once daily) START Lactulose 30 mL by mouth twice a day START Spirinolactone 50 mg by mouth daily START Furosomide 30 mg by mouth daily START Prednisone 40 mg by mouth daily for 21 days START Calcium Carbonate 500 mg by mouth twice a day for 21 days START Vitamin D 800 units by mouth once a day  If you start to have increasing blood in your stool, vomitting (with or without blood), uncontrollable bleeding from any site, abdominal pain, nausea, confusion, shortness of breath, chest pain, decreased urine output, worsening yellow of your skin or any other symptom that concerns you, please contact your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Hospital1 18**] Liver Center, call 911 or go immediately to the nearest emergency room for treatment.
