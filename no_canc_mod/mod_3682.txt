Stable left middle mediastinal contour irregularity, likely related to a trotous aorta and unchanged since [**2115**].
HEAD CT: IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
CXR [**5-11**] IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Partial obscuration of both hemidiaphragms may be related to effusions and body habitus, but early basilar pneumonia is not excluded.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Asymmetric dilatation of descending thoracic aorta.
Differential diagnosis includes a large penetrating ulcer, changes from prior focal aortic dissection or a post-traumatic pseudoaneurysm.
There is no evidence of acute aortic dissection.
Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
No pleural effusion.
Severe emphysema with superimposed areas of ground-glass opacity which could represent congestive heart failure.
No pleural effusion.

MR HEAD: IMPRESSION: No acute infarct or enhancing abnormalities.
[**Month/Year (2) **]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers (however images suboptimal; cannot exclude).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.

FOOT X_RAY: RIGHT FOOT: There is no fracture or dislocation.
There is diffuse demineralization.
There is no osseous erosion or joint space narrowing, but there is mild spurring at the tarsometatarsal joints dorsally.
There are clawtoe deformities and lateral deviation at the tarsometatarsal joints.

LEFT FOOT: There is no fracture or dislocation.
There is no osseous erosion or joint space narrowing.

There is prominent ankle soft tissue swelling.
LP: [**2118-5-12**] 05:13PM CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) TotProt-44 Glucose-99 [**2118-5-12**] 05:13PM CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) WBC-2 RBC-2* Polys-0 Lymphs-76 Monos-24 Negative HSV PCR   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the floor for further of hypoxia, fevers, and altered mental status.
She was treated for Pneumonia and for CHF.
No significant hypo- or hyperglycemia.
Additionally patient continued to have continued hypoxia and ABG on [**5-12**] was 7.41/42/58/28.
On [**5-12**] the pt was transferred to the MICU for intubation to treat her hypoxia and allow for deep sedation to obtain diagnostic tests.
LP was negative for infection, EEG was negative for seizure, MRI did not show stoke or mass, and CTA was negative for PE.
It did show ground glass opacities on uncertain etiology.
Further work-up included an [**Month/Day (2) 113**] which was negative for pulmonary hypertension or shunt.
Ultimately, it was felt by pulm and rheumatology consults that her hypoxia was not due to an acute pulmonary or rheumatologic issue.
There is most likely a very large anxiety component on top of baseline restrictive lung disease + COPD.
# Chest Pain: With regard to her CP, she had 3 sets of negative CEs and no EKG changes suggestive of ischemia.
She continued to have several episodes of chest pain and SOB per day during the remainder of her hospital course; however, during each episode, it was ultimately attributed to anxiety attacks.
Thus, her chest pain episodes were felt to be secondary to her severe anxiety and were dramatically relieved with ativan.
# Anxiety: Patient was seen and evaluated by psychiatry for her hx of psychotic depression and extreme anxiety.
On discharge, she was taking Lexapro 20 mg QD and Ativan 1-2 mg every 4 hours as needed for anxiety.
# Mental Status: CT of the head was negative for bleed or stroke and EEG did not show evidence of seizure.
A medical cause for her fevers and hypoxia was investegated.
It was thought that her hypoxia could be inducing her aggitation, but also it was possible that her aggitation was inducing her hypoxia and her oxygen need was lower when agitation was treated.
# FEVERS: The patient had low-grade temperatures initially thought to be either PNA, UTI.
Rheumatology was consulted to investigate possible contriubtion of RA to her low grade fevers and lung disease seen on CT. RA was not felt to be involved.
By discharge, she had been afebrile for >72 hours.
She had one blood culture which grew coag neg staph felt to be contaminant.
At the time of discharge, she was symptoms free and afebrilke  Medications on Admission: Aspirin 325 mg qd Lexapro 20 mg qd Trazodone 150 mg q.h.s.
Ativan 1 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: 1-2 Tablets PO every four (4) hours as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypoxia of uncertain etiology - likely underlying lung disease exacerbated by aggitated delerium and psychiatric decompensation; now improved .
-CAD NSTMI [**2-17**] c Cath showing 90% LCx lesion treated with stent.

Discharge Condition: stable, chest pain free   Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications as prescribed.
If you develop spiking fevers, an increased oxygen demand, or increased confusion and aggitaion please contact your health are providers.
