CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2134-6-1**]):       POSITIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
INTERPRETATION:  SUGGESTIVE OF PRIMARY INFECTION.
Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >[**2121**] mg/dl may cause       interference with CMV IgM results.
There is no evidence of masses, hydronephrosis, abscess, or stones.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of renal abscess.
Cholelithiasis or biliary sludge within the gallbladder.
Further evaluation for cholecystitis is limited without intravenous contrast.
If clinical concern for cholecystitis exists, a followup right upper quadrant ultrasound could be considered.
Right adnexal hypodense lesion incompletely characterized on unenhanced CT. 3.
Hepatic steatosis.
The presence of minimal fluid overload cannot be excluded.
However, there is no overt pulmonary edema.
No pleural effusions.
No evidence for stones or sludge.
No evidence for cholecystitis.
Increased echogenicity of the liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Please note that other forms of liver disease including significant fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this study.
Two hemorrhagic cysts on the right ovary.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 year old woman with a history of T2DM and hypothyroidism admitted with fever, fatigue and myalgias, course complicated by hypotension, found to have acute CMV infection.
# Acute cytomegalovirus infection: Her initial presentation with a fever, fatigue, diarrhea and diffuse myalgias was initially thought to be consistent with mononucleosis or a similar viral illness.
At admission, monospot was negative and CMV IgM was positive with a negative IgG which is consistent with acute CMV infection.
A renal US and CT abd/pelvis (without contrast because of prior adverse reaction to IV contrast) did not show any evidence of renal or preinephric abscess or other causes to explain her fevers.
This US was unremarkable and did not show cholecyctitis or CBD dilation.
She continued to have fevers up to 101.9F during this admission.
She has been instructed that CMV infection can take weeks to resolve and that she will likely continue to have these symptoms along with fevers during this time.
We considered sending a HIV test, but this was deferred to her PCP given that her CMV infection is a better explaiantion for her symptoms and she has no high risk behaviors for HIV infection.
#Hypotension: In the setting of high fevers and poor PO intake, she was briefly hypotensive to the high 70 to low 80s systolic on her first night of admission.
She was asymptomatic and CXR was unremarkable.
Likely cause was atelectasis and she was given an incentive spirometer on the floor.
#Transaminitis: LFTs mildly elevated this admission to the 40-50s, which is consistent with her acute CMV infection.
RUQ US was unremarkable with no cholecystitis, stones or CBD dilation.
#UTI: She had pansensitive E. coli at an outpatient visit prior to admission, no perinephric abscess or hydro on renal US or on CT abd/pelvis.
She had no urinary symptoms and urine culture was negative at admission.
She was not on medications for her diabetes at admission and blood sugar remained well controlled.
#Hypothyroidism: Continued on home dose of levothyroxine 100mcg daily  #Code status this admission: Full (confirmed)  #Transitional issues: -Should have an HIV test as an outpatient given her recent acute CMV infection -Will need repeat LFTs in [**4-2**] weeks to assess for resolution of her transaminitis -Has been instructed to continue to consume plenty of fluids (including juice and sport drinks) while she is having diarrhea and high fevers.
-Has been advised that she may continue to have fatigue, myalgias and high fevers for a few weeks while her CMV infection resolves  Medications on Admission: Medications: (home) -Ciprofloxacin 500 mg Oral q12h for 7 days (D1=[**2134-5-27**], stopped [**2134-5-29**]) -Cefpodoxime 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (started [**2134-5-29**], still taking) -Sertraline 50 mg Oral daily -Gabapentin 300 mg Oral Capsule 1 capsule nightly -Ibuprofen 200 mg Oral Tablet 3 tablets with food twice a day as needed for pain -Pravastatin 20 mg Oral Tablet Take 1 tablet every evening for cholesterol -Levothyroxine 100 mcg Oral Tablet take 1 tablet by mouth a day  -MELATONIN ORAL 1 to 3 mg daily -GINSENG ORAL take daily - available over the counter -BLOOD SUGAR DIAGNOSTIC TEST STRIPS (ONE TOUCH ULTRA TEST STRIPS) InVt Strp use as directed twice daily -LANCETS (ONE TOUCH ULTRASOFT LANCETS) Misc Misc USE AS DIRECTED to test blood sugar twice daily -CINNAMON ORAL pt reports she takes 1 capsule every pm -MULTIVITAMIN CAPSULE PO (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 po qd -CALCIUM CARBONATE TABLET 650MG PO as .
