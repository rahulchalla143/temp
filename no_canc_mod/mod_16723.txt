MATERNAL HISTORY:  Mother is a 36 year old gravida II, para 0-II woman with past medical history notable for uterine fibroids and infertility.
In utero insemination pregnancy with diamniotic dichorionic twin gestation.
Pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus initially controlled with diet but requiring insulin for the week prior to delivery.
On Magnesium Sulfate, but noted to have bulging membranes with presenting foot and progressed to cesarean section for breech/breech presentation under spinal anesthesia.
Membranes ruptured at delivery yielding clear amniotic fluid, no maternal fever or fetal tachycardia intrapartum.
NEONATAL COURSE:  The infant emerges weak cry and developed apnea and bradycardia, responsive to bulb suctioning of copious secretions, tactile stimulation, dry and brief positive pressure, bag and mask ventilation.
Subsequently pink with moderate retractions and brief oxygen.
Chest - moderate retractions with spontaneous breaths, good excursion with IMV but requiring significant inspiratory pressure of 25 to 30 centimeters of water.
Scattered coarse crackles.
The abdomen is soft, nondistended, no organomegaly, no masses.
His baseline respiratory rate is 40s to 60s and he has an occasional episode of apnea and bradycardia.
Cardiovascular - The baby had an initial presumed patent ductus arteriosus and was started on first course of Indomethacin which was completed on day of life three.
On [**2137-10-21**], his echocardiogram showed a moderate patent ductus arteriosus with left to right flow.
He completed his second course of Indomethacin and had a repeat echocardiogram on [**2137-10-23**], which showed a small patent ductus arteriosus.
He persists with a soft murmur with stable heart rate of 140s to 170s and blood pressure of 71/40 with a mean of 51.
He had a central PICC line placed on [**2137-10-21**], which was removed on [**2137-11-2**], without incident.
He then had his caloric density increased.
Infectious disease - The baby initially had blood culture and complete blood count sent with a white count of 12.7, 21 polys, 0 bands, 73 lymphocytes and platelet count of 291,000.
He has had no further issues with infection.
c.  With chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family or other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Status post respiratory distress syndrome.
Status post rule out sepsis with antibiotics.
