She had an unwitnessed fall and was found at the bottom of the stairs.
She was confused after the fall and has been unable to provide a clear story around the time of the fall.
She was admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital where there was concern for a C4 fracture as well as STEMI with elevated troponins.
A CT Torso did not show any acute injuries.
CT Cspine did not show a definite fracture and her c-spine was cleared by ortho.
Cardiology was consulted in the ED who recommended admission to CCU and discontinuing Heparin gtt as suspicion for STEMI was low.
On discussion with her son, she does not have documented dementia but has not left her house in over a year because she gets lost and confused, has people come to her house to cut her hair and her nails, but is apparently up and about without issues while within her home.

Again, she has not left her home in over a year and has people who come by to help her obtain food, cut her hair and nails, and help with tasks around the home.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Small ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe which is nonspecific but may represent contusion in setting of trauma vs infection.
If clinically relevant given patient age, recommend follow-up to resolution to exclude underlying lesion.
Markedly distended bladder.
CXR Portable [**12-22**]: FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION: No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.
There may be mild edema.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
There is moderate cardiomegaly.
No displaced fracture is identified.
No evidence of pneumonia.
ECHO [**12-24**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal septal and apical hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Discharge: CK: 279 creatinine 1.1 INR 1.0 Hgb and hematocrit: 10.8/33 RPR neg  Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]F with hx of HTN, HLD, COPD (diagnosed by our CT scan), and likely severe baseline dementia transferred from OSH for concern of ACS after being found down.
# Hyperactive Delerium and Severe Dementia: During this admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 60680**] had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status with agitation.
She was oftentimes found speaking to herself for hours on end with poor sleep and agitation.
Per report of the family, she was also noted to have poor baseline functioning without having left her house for years and not being able to perform ADL's c/w severe dementia.
It was felt that she was likely delirious from a new environment, UTI which was effectively treated, tethers, lack of sleep, and her baseline poor vision (due to macular degeneration).
She did not respond well to redirection or small doses PO zydis but responded somewhat to small doses of subQ haldol in the CCU, but responded slightly to 0.25 risperidone [**Hospital1 **].
# E. Coli UTI: She had a positive UA on admission and was started on IV ceftriaxone in the ED.
Urine cultures grew pan-sensitive e. coli which cleared on repeat culture and blood cultures were NGTD.
# Syncope Workup: Pt was found at the base of stairs although imaging including CT torso did not demonstrate any fractures making it unlikely that she fell down the stairs.
She had STE's in the anteroseptal leads on his EKG in the ED which were stable from EKG's in [**2154**].
She also had LVH on EKG so her ST changes were thought to likely represent repolarization abnormality.
She had elevated troponins but negative CKMB's which raised the possibility that we were catching the tail end of a myocardial event although this was unclear.
She had no events on tele, and a fairly unremarkable echo with LVEF of 45-50%.
It was felt that her fall was more likely mechanical related to her near complete blindness, UTI, and mild dehydration from her home lasix.
# Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Kidney Injury: Pt was admitted with CK elevation to 1863 and Cr of 1.1 (baseline unclear but we expect something in the 0.7-0.8 range given her old age and size) after being down for possibly 18 hours.
Repeat CK was 279 and at time of discharge Cr had decreased to baseline.
2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID PRN as needed for constipation.
6. risperidone 0.25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO qHS: PRN as needed for delerium.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 671**] [**Hospital 4094**] Hospital - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Urinary tract infection acute kidney injury rhabdomyolysis altered mental status   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to the hospital for a UTI and altered mental status.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because the outside hospital was concerned that you were having a heart attack.
In the cardiac intensive care unit, it was determined that you were actually not having a heart attack.
You were found to have an acute kidney injury and a condition called rhabdomyolysis.
We treated you with IV fluids and your kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis improved.
You remained confused and not completely oriented despite treating your infection and are being discharged to a facility to continue to work on your mental status.
Stop meloxicam 3. start risperidone 0.25 tablet one tablet twice daily 4. start risperidone 0.25 tablet qHS PRN for delerium  Please follow-up with your PCP after discharge from your rehab.
