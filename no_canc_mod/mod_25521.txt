of tonic-clonic seizures (in context of history of head injury and skull fracture 25 years ago) on Lamotrigine, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and anxiety who is transferred from the MICU to the general medicine floor after an acute change in mental status at work and gait instability.
Patient states he has experienced progressive fatigue for the past 6 months.
He developed a headache and "sinus congestion" 2 days ago, and began taking OTC medication (sudafed) for nasal stuffiness.
Patient drove to work on day of admission without any trouble.
However, when he got to his office he was found to be increasingly confused and with slurred speech.
Thought that episode was likely due to intoxication from multiple medications, including lithium (in one of the herbal supplements he was taking).
An LP was done, which was not consistent with bacterial infection however, patient was continued on acyclovir.
Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain with urination, current fevers or chills.
Past Medical History: - Generalized seizure disorder on lamictal, no recent dose changes.
- Migraines that are temporally related to seizures and started recently after seizure disorder diagnosis made - Anxiety (?)
- takes clonazepam prn - HTN - HL - Gout - History of MVA with skull fracture while in his 20s.
He is married and has no children.
No tobacco, alcohol, or other illicits.

Prevertebral soft tissue appears within normal limits.
Extensive opacification of the right greater than left maxillary sinuses is noted.
Slight atelectatic appearance of the right maxillary sinus is better depicted on accompanying head CT, suggestive of chronic sinusitis.
There is no focal thyroid lesion.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
IMPRESSION: No cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
CT Head [**2197-3-30**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, edema, midline shift, or acute hydrocephalus.
There is no major vascular territorial infarction.
Prominent right frontal extra-axial space with mild mass effect on the right frontal lobe as well as right frontal osseous cortical thinning likely represents an arachnoid cyst.
Tiny hypodensity in the left basal ganglia is likely a dilated perivascular space.
There is extensive mucosal thickening within the right maxillary sinus with a slight atelectatic appearance to the bony sinus, suggestive of chronic sinusitis.
Mild mucosal thickening is also noted in the left maxillary sinus and ethmoidal air cells.
No acute intracranial pathology.
Right frontal arachnoid cyst.
Likely chronic paranasal sinus disease.
Nasogastric tube has side port in the distal esophagus and tip just beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
MRI/MRV/MRA Head [**2197-3-30**]: MRI OF THE BRAIN: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, intra-axial masses, mass effect or infarction.
There is circumferential mucosal thickening at right maxillary sinus with a central hypointense signal, likely representing inspissated secretions or fungus ball.
There is a mucus retention cyst at the anterior wall of the left maxillary sinus.
MRV OF THE HEAD: There is no evidence of deep or superficial cortical or dural sinus venous thrombosis.
The right transverse sinus is dominant, the left appears hypoplastic without evidence of thrombosis.
There is a small Pacchioni granulation in the left transverse sinus (1103:86).
MRA OF THE HEAD: There is no evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis, occlusion, dissection, aneurysm or vascular malformation of the intracranial vertebral arteries, basilar arteries, carotid arteries, circle of [**Location (un) 431**] or their major branches.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema or infarction.
There is no evidence of intracranial venous thrombosis.
Mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus with central hypointense signal, likely representing inspissated secretions from chronic sinusitis or less likely a fungus ball.
Chest X-ray [**2197-3-30**]: CHEST, AP: New orogastric tube has side port in the distal esophagus and tip just beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: OGT at GEJ; this may be advanced a few centimeters for optimal positioning.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 45-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of epilepsy (attributed to MVA in his 20s), anxiety, hypertension, gout, and hypercholesterolemia who is admitted with altered mental status and fall.
CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS:  Resolved gradually over course of hospitalization, but likely from gradual "build-up" of multiple prescribed and herbal medications.
These medications are undoubtedly contributing to confusion, slurred speech, and change in mental status.
However, other etiologies of mental status change must also be considered such as infection or seizure.
Patient did complain of sinus congestion for a few days prior to admission (even missed work on the day prior to admission) but CXR and u/a unremarkable, and LP not consistent with bacterial infection.
Another potential etiology of mental status change is seizure (given history) however, patient had a slowly declining mental status (over an hour or two) and no seziure activity was wittnesed and he was not post-ictal.
He was seen by neurology and an EEG was done, which showed general encephalopathic changes.
An MRI brain did not show evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or infarction.
# SEIZURE DISORDER:  Event unlikely seizure related, with no witnessed event, no post-ictal state, and negative EEG.
# HTN:  Will clarify home BP medications and touch base with patient's PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) 26998**] for now, but will treat high pressures as needed.
# ANXIETY/DEPRESSION: No evidence of overdose except +tox for methadone (which could be related to Ultram patient was taking at home).
During admssion, patient was not given any anxiolytics, and exhibited no over signs of anxiety.
He will likely need further treatment for anxiety and depression as an outpatient.
# SINUSITIS:  As seen on MRI.
Patient has chronic frontal headaches and post-nasal drip.
Hypercholesterolemia  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came to the hospital because you had a change in mental status and some confusion.
You were also found to have a sinus infection on MRI.
Return to the hospital if you develop fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, change in mental status/confusion, loss of consciousness, dizziness, palpitations, seizures, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any other concerning signs or symptoms.
