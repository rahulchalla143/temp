Moderately dilated LV cavity.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:      N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions PREBYPASS No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The ascending aorta is mild to moderately dilated (4.1cm).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The repaired aortic valve demonstrates significant (moderate) aortic insufficiency.
POSTBYPASS #2 (The patient is receiving epinephrine 0.02 ucg/kg/min (27 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] porcine supra) LV systolic function is mildly globally depressed in the setting of inotropes.
There is trace valvular AI which is normal in quantity and location for this type of prosthesis.
He did have several short bursts of atrial fibrillation for which he was started on Amiodarone and Coumadin.
