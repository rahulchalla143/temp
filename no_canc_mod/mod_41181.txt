She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managment of these bleeds.
On transfer here, she was also loaded with dilantin and started on Nicardipine drip for BP control.
Initially admitted to the neurosurgery service for management of intracranial hemorrhages, but transferred to neurology.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] stated that she has had a headache for the last 5 days, since Monday at noon.

The pain was localized to the right temple.

No known history of malignancy, thought did have a tubular adenoma on colonoscopy in [**2182**].
Currently, she does not have a headache.
She denies any difficulty with her vision on initial questioning, but does notice she cannot see well when she is unable to answer what color eyes examiner has, etc.
Of note, [**Name (NI) **] husband gives a somewhat different account of yesterday's events.
On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.
Denies difficulties producing or comprehending speech.
No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or chills.

Past Medical History: Hypertension (last BP measurement in clinic was in 130s, 2 years ago, not on any medications) Hyperlipidemia Varicose vein stripping Colonsopy with tubular adenoma in [**2182**] Lumbar surgery  Social History: Retired office manager.
Tobacco: Denies EtoH: rare, social  Family History: No history of lupus Father had thoracic aortic aneurysm [**2183**], afib Mother passed away at age 75, unsure from what Maternal grandmother had MI  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM on Admission: GCS  15 O: T:98.6  BP: 173/92 HR: 88   R 18 O2Sats 98%2L Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Toes upgoing bilaterally  Coordination: decreased finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin (limited by deminished vision and weakness)  DISCHARGE EXAM: VITALS: GEN: sitting up in a chair, pleasant and NAD EXT: pitting edema in all extremities, L>R NEURO: Mental Status: alert, awake, speech fluent.
CN: mild L nasolabial fold flattening, no dysarthria.
Parenchymal hemorrhage within the right cerebral hemisphere with surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect with leftward shift of normally midline structures (10 mm shift).
Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Hypodensity within the left parieto-occipital, left frontal and right frontal regions of unclear etiology.
Unclear if patient has some underlying disease or brain metastases that have hemorrhaged.
Right cerebral parenchymal hemorrhage and surrounding vasogenic edema, 11 mm leftward shift of normally midline structures (previously 10 mm at a comparable level), bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage 2.
Hypodense areas within the right parieto-occipital, right and left frontal regions.
ATTENDING NOTE: No change in mass effect or hemorrhage.
Stable appearance of right parietal and frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Hypodensities in the bilateral frontal and occipital lobes are noted likely representing edema.
Differential diagnosis includes PRES with hemorrhagic conversion; however, underlying mass is not completely excluded.
If there is concern for underlying metastasis MRI could be useful for further evaluation.
No abnormal vascular structures, arterial venous malformation or enhancing mass lesions are seen.
[**2185-10-8**] MRI/MRV: Multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhages in the right parietal and occipital lobes, with additional foci of vasogenic edema in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres and in the left cerebellum.
Findings could represent PRES with hemorrhage versus  venous infarcts, although the lack of visualization of the left transverse sinus could be related to a hypoplastic sinus rather than venous sinus thrombosis.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.
Would like to uptitrate lisinopril and wean off clonidine if possible [] Plan for renal biopsy, will likely need to be scheduled as outpatient ([**10-27**]) [] LUE PICC associated DVT, held off on systemic anticoagulation given recent intraparenchymal hemorrhages, but will need lovenox prophylaxis x2 weeks and may require follow up ultrasound in few weeks to re-evaluate.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is 57yo RHW with PMH of HLD and borderline HTN who presented to OSH after her husband found her lying on the floor in their living room window and and CT scan there demonstrated a large R parietal/occipital IPH and R parietal SAH with posterior white matter changes, consistent with PRES.
# Neuro: Patient with initial left sided weakness, L visual field deficit and hemineglect as well.
Patient also complained of headaches while in the ICU, which improved with blood pressure control.
She was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis, given that she was found down in house and it was unclear whether or not she had a seizure at home.
Patient did not have a clinical seizure in the hospital.
After she was transferred to the floor, she required IV hydralazine 1-2 times daily due to elevated blood pressures.
Lisinopril was added for better blood pressure control and also for her nephrotic syndrome (as below).
# CV: No history of cardiac problems, though her last PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] ~2 years ago document SBP of 130s.
Patient's hypertension was difficult to control and required multiple medications as above.
# Renal: No history of kidney problems in the past, patient with Cr of 1.8 on presentation and nephrotic syndrome with edema and proteinuria.
Patient did report that she had swelling in her legs and foamy urine for a few months, during this summer.
SPEP did not show any specific abnormalities and UPEP showed predominant albumin but negative for Bence-[**Doctor Last Name **] protein, and no monoclonal immunoglobulin.
Renal was planning for kidney biopsy but it was deferred because of her labile blood pressure.
# ID: Patient had initial leukocytosis, and infectious work up was done but negative.
She did have positive coag neg staph in blood culture, and received vancomycin for a few days, but as it was only 1 out of 2 bottles, and subsequent BCx negative to date, it was thought to be due to contamination.
Patient developed a PICC associated LUE DVT, no DVT seen in LLE.
Atorvastatin 40 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital for Continuing Medical Care - [**Location (un) 1121**] ([**Hospital3 1122**] Center)  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: PRES with IPH of the right occipital hemorrhage.
HTN   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had a condition called PRES or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome due to high blood pressure.
You had a bleed in the back of your brain causing you to lose vision.
