Admission Date:  [**2108-6-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2108-6-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2036-6-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, known coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2098**] and prior percutaneous coronary interventions) who presented for elective catheterization after experiencing increasing dyspnea and angina on exertion.
The patient had recurrence of exertional angina in [**2107-12-13**] and went for a catheterization on [**2108-1-11**].
His symptoms returned six weeks later, and the patient went for re-catheterization on [**2108-3-14**].
His symptoms improved slightly, but following catheterization the patient states he has experienced a progressive decrease in his exercise tolerance with frequent dyspnea and angina on exertion that resolves with rest.
The patient denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, edema, claudication, or lightheadedness.
He has longstanding hypertension and hyperlipidemia but denies a history of diabetes or a family history of coronary artery disease.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, the patient denies melena and bright red blood per rectum.
He says he has never been diagnosed with Crohn's disease.
The left circumflex with 100% intermediate in-stent restenosis with discontinuity at the distal end consistent with spontaneous stent fracture secondary to chronic flexion extension at the saphenous vein graft touchdown site.
The first obtuse marginal and second obtuse marginal had mild irregularities.
Intervention details revealed attempts were made to cross the entire length of the stent with 0.014 PT Graphics wire.
Ultimately, the wire was passed at the distal structure, and distal dye injection demonstrated small myocardial perforation with connection to myocardial vein draining into the coronary sinus.
At this point, the patient became severely hypotensive requiring initiation of pressors.
An emergent echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular systolic function with no evidence of a pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary artery saturation increased to 90% on dopamine, but there was no evidence for stepup during saturation run.
The patient's chest pain and hypotension gradually resolved, and the patient was discontinued on dopamine.
A repeat angiogram demonstrated no further dye extravasation and persistent occlusion of intermedius stent.
The patient was lying in bed with a hot blanket in no acute distress.
No jugular venous pressure or carotid bruits were present.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The patient had positive bowel sounds, nontender and nondistended.
The femoral line was not bleeding and had no bruit.
His echocardiogram at the time of catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 75% to 80%, left ventricular cavity under filled, left ventricular systolic function was hyperdynamic, no wall abnormalities, no aortic regurgitation, trivial mitral regurgitation, and no pericardial effusions.
Heparin was held secondary to possible myocardial bleed.
A repeat echocardiogram in the morning showed no signs of a pericardial effusion.
to treat his anginal symptoms.
Cycling of the creatine phosphokinases revealed a peak of 71 with no troponins.
The patient frequent premature atrial contractions, but no ectopy.
This was likely due to dilutional effects from the catheterization.
