Admission Date:  [**2191-6-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2191-6-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2124-5-25**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 3805**] Gree  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hemoptysis and altered mental status and hypoxemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 9035**] is a 67-year-old female with end stage multiple sclerosis at [**Known lastname 5348**] who is aphasic and minimally interactive.
She was brought to the Emergency Room by her daughter for an episode of hemoptysis this afternoon associated with three weeks of increasing lethargy and a cough productive of yellowish-clear sputum.
The day of admission, the patient developed a worsening cough productive of dark sputum.
Of note, the patient has a decreased intake through her G-tube over the past three days secondary to coughing and for fear of aspiration.
No abdominal pain.
In the field, the patient was apparently found to have oxygen saturation in the 80's on room air, otherwise, her vital signs were stable.
She intermittently had cough productive of dark brown and greenish sputum and when she had difficulty clearing the secretions and, with the secretions, her oxygen saturation would drop temporarily until she was able to be suctioned.
This is a chronic progressive form     of the disease and was diagnosed 14 years ago.
Seizure disorder first diagnosed a year ago, on Dilantin.
Frequent UTI's with MRSA and VRE in the past.
History of multiple aspiration pneumonias.
She has apparent Redman syndrome, although the patient has tolerated vancomycin in the past with slow infusion and premedication with Tylenol and Benadryl.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a niece with multiple sclerosis.
Her chest x-ray showed no acute CHF or infiltrates.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with no acute ischemic changes.
CTA to rule out PE was considered, but the patient was considered too unstable in the Emergency Room to have this done and the patient's daughter, the health care proxy, was reluctant to have exams and insisted they be done only if absolutely necessary.
Pulmonary:  The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure was deemed likely due to either a bronchitis with mucous secretions or an aspiration pneumonia superimposed on her neuromuscular dysfunction from her multiple sclerosis with poor pulmonary reserve.
She was treated with albuterol and Atrovent nebulized p.r.n..  To allow her to minimize secretions and to clear those secretions, she was treated with a scopolamine patch and with chest physical therapy.
The patient's Dilantin was held for a super therapeutic level and should be restarted when she has a level less than 20.
Infectious disease:  The patient had low grade fevers, along with the white cells in the urine.
She was treated with levofloxacin empirically, and all the sputum, [**Month/Year (2) **], and urine cultures were still pending on [**6-15**], and the source of her low grade fevers and white cells in the urine was uncertain.
The antibiotics will need to be adjusted for the culture data, given the patient's history of MRSA and VRE in the urine.
Gastrointestinal:  On arrival to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had one episode of coffee ground aspirate from her G-tube.
The patient had a normal EGD and colonoscopy, with the exception of some erythema in the gastric mucosa and some diverticula, roughly one year prior to presentation.
It was likely gastritis versus [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear from coughing or retching.
If the patient was treated conservatively for this GI bleed, she had no recurrence of the GI bleed nor aspirate of heme positive contact.
Code status:  Patient is Do Not Resuscitate, however, the patient should be intubated temporarily for acute respiratory compromise with the understanding that this would likely be just for the family to arrive to the hospital and see the patient and then make their final decision to withdraw care.
