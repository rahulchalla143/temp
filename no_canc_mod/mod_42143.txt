Admission Date:  [**2140-3-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2140-4-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2088-2-1**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Purple-Bariatric Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51 year old gentleman with Class 3 morbid obesity with a weight of 358 pounds and a body mass index of 53 who was referred to the Bariatric Surgery Program after failing several attempts at weight loss.
His medical morbidities included insulin dependent diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus with difficult to control hemoglobin A1c consistently above 8, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea.
There is also a history of recurrent pneumonias.
He had no prior gallbladder disease but has not had a cholecystectomy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, Type 2 insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with neuropathy, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea requiring CPAP, recurrent pneumonia, recurrent kidney stones, history of non-A, non-B hepatitis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or alcohol.
There were no intraoperative complications.
He was, however, noted to go into rapid atrial fibrillation shortly after the induction of anesthesia.
He was then extubated in the Operating Room and transferred to the Recovery Room in stable condition in sinus rhythm, however, he had bursts of rapid atrial fibrillation in the Recovery Room requiring multiple doses of intravenous beta blocker.
His electrolytes were checked and repleted and the patient at that time reported a history of some palpitations and "irregular heart beat," associated with his pneumonia.
He remained without urologic deficits and now with good control throughout his hospitalization.
Cardiovascular - As stated prior soon after induction of anesthesia for the first procedure, the patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation and over the next 24 hours was in and out of atrial fibrillation.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and he ruled out for myocardial infarction.
His rate over the course of the next few days was relatively well controlled and he was noted to go in and out of atrial fibrillation.
Per Cardiology recommendations he was started on a heparin drip on postoperative day #4 due to the fact that he was again in and out of atrial fibrillation.
This was continued at a therapeutic dose until it was stopped but not before Coumadin had been started for anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.
He had initially been hypertensive and was placed on Lopressor 150 b.i.d., however, his blood pressure was trending down and his Lopressor thus was decreased to 100 b.i.d.
Of note, he was able to be weaned off of his Diltiazem drip and was then maintained on the Lopressor, however, he again on postoperative day #15, he again had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response which responded to one dose of intravenous Lopressor.
He was initially stable, however, over the course of the day developed worsening respiratory distress and was weaned and intubated by blind nasotracheal intubation.
He was having fever spikes and a chest x-ray done showed a retrocardiac infiltrate consistent with a ventilator-associated pneumonia for which he was started on Levaquin.
He remained afebrile with a normal white blood cell count for the remainder of his hospital stay.
After transfer to the floor, he was encouraged to ambulate with incentive spirometry and chest physical therapy for pulmonary toilet.
Gastrointestinal - Given the evidence of anastomotic leak on the Methylene Blue swallow test, an upper gastrointestinal series was deferred.
After his sepsis resolved his tube feeds were weaned down and he was started on a Stage 1 diet which he tolerated well.
He had a repeat Methylene Blue test that was again negative for any leak or contrast extravasation.
He had a computerized tomography scan of his abdomen done because of fevers and this did not show any intra-abdominal abscess infiltrate and no collections.
He failed a voiding trial while in the Intensive Care Unit, so his Foley catheter was replaced and left in place.
He also had a decrease in his hematocrit to 27 at that time.
This ultrasound revealed a bilateral nonocclusive, nonobstructing calculi with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
These were advanced to goal without difficulty.
Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] initially was placed on the standard subcutaneous heparin, however, his multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation over the hospital course he was heparinized and Coumadin was started for goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.
He did received some blood transfusions for blood loss anemia of critical illness and otherwise remained stable from a hematologic standpoint.
This was continued for  a course, however, he started to spike fevers and was pancultured.
SUMMARY:  This is a 52 year old gentleman with morbid obesity, status post laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a prolonged and complicated hospital course significant for atrial fibrillation, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with insulin-resistance and acute renal failure.
Morbid obesity.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Acute renal failure.
Blood loss anemia, resolving.
