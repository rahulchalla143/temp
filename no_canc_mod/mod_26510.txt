[**Hospital 37544**] medical history was significant for IDDM, asthma, 1st pregnancy TBA, 2nd pregnancy fetal demise at 23-weeks gestation, history of tobacco.
This pregnancy was complicated by cervical incompetence.
Rupture of membranes occurred the morning of delivery with fluid reported to be greenish-yellow.
There was no maternal fever at time of ruptured membranes.
A decision to deliver infant by C-section was made due to breech position under general anesthesia.
The infant emerged floppy and no spontaneous respirations.
No grimace and no spontaneous respirations.
Though the tone and grimace remained depressed likely secondary to general anesthesia.
Abdomen: Soft, no bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
GU: Normal preterm female, patent anus, no sacral anomalies.
Tone: Reduced overall likely from anesthesia demonstrating slightly steady improvement over time.
On the skin, there was a right scapular laceration with full thickness approximately 3/4-1 inch in length with no active bleeding.
She remained intubated on low ventilator settings through til [**2186-11-25**] which is day of life 36 at which time, she extubated to CPAP and remained on nasal prong CPAP until [**2187-10-18**] which is day 59 when she presented with bloody stools.
She was noted to have apnea and lethargy.
She was reintubated because of the severity of her illness and her poor respiratory effort.
She is presently on nasal cannula at 50 cc per minute flow and 100% FIO2 not having any apnea or bradycardic spells at this time.
Clear and equal breath sounds with mild retractions.
Cardiovascular: On day 2 of life, she presented with clinical symptoms of a patent ductus arteriosus.
Symptoms included bounding pulses, a murmur, and metabolic acidosis.
A follow-up echocardiogram was done on [**2187-10-24**] which showed no PDA, a question of a small ASD or PFO at that time.
Murmur resolved just after the Indocin, and she has been free of a murmur up until [**2186-12-10**], day of life 51, at which time she presented with an intermittent murmur which has continued through to this time and is thought to be a benign PPS murmur.
Also initially at birth, she did require 1 normal saline bolus for hypotension which quickly resolved after the normal saline infusion.
Enteral feedings were initiated on day of life 6 with slow trophic feeds at that time.
Her calories were then increased to maximum caloric density of 30 calories per ounce of PE 30 with Promod which she achieved on [**2186-11-10**].
Her KUB was abnormal with large dilated loops.
She had a barium enema on [**2187-1-2**] which showed a colonic stricture at the splenic flexture likely related to medical NEC.
Prior to surgery, her coagulation studies were noted to be elevated on [**2187-1-8**] with PT 14.2, PTT 65.5, INR of 1.4.
She does not have any [**Month (only) **] from previous transfusion left in the [**Month (only) **] bank.
Infectious disease: Due to suspected sepsis at birth, a CBC and [**Month (only) **] culture were done on admission.
But due to presumed sepsis and chorioamnionitis at birth, she was treated for a total of 14 days, a decent sample due to a bloody tap.
A repeat [**Month (only) **] culture was drawn on day of life 8 which grew gram-positive cocci which was felt to be a contaminant, but her antibiotic therapy was changed from ampicillin to vancomycin at that time.
Abnormal KUB with bloody stool.
Born between 32 and 35 weeks gestation with 2 of  the following: Daycare during the RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or school-age siblings; or 3.
With chronic lung disease.
Before this age and for the 1st 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Respiratory distress syndrome, extremely low birth weight premature infant, sepsis suspect, medical NEC x2, back laceration from delivery, patent ductus arteriosus treated, hyperbilirubinemia resolved, chronic lung disease ongoing, presumed meningitis treated, distal transverse colon stricture, retinopathy of prematurity, anemia of prematurity, and coagulopathy.
