Admission Date:  [**2155-2-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2155-2-12**]   Service:  [**Location (un) **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old, Caucasian, female patient with history of early Alzheimer's dementia and diabetes mellitus type II, a remote history of breast cancer, but previously otherwise independent who was recently admitted to the Neurosurgical Service on [**2155-2-1**] status post a head trauma with right frontotemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral edema.
The patient was followed by the Neurosurgical Service and was loaded initially with Dilantin for concern of seizures as well as Decadron for cerebral edema demonstrated on a head CT.
The patient's neurologic status remained relatively stable since her accident, and she was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for rehabilitation on the day of admission.
Prior to discharge, today, the patient was noted to have a low-grade fever of 100 degrees for which she was started on levofloxacin for possible pneumonia as she failed a recent speech and swallow evaluation in-house and self-discontinued her nasogastric tube with possible aspiration.
Once she arrived at [**Hospital1 **], the patient was noted to have a fever of 102 or 103 and was sent to back to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 69**] for reevaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type II, Alzheimer's dementia, breast cancer status post mastectomy, atrial fibrillation.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Lung exam reveals shallow breaths bilaterally with crackles in the right upper lobe and right lower lobe.
Decreased breath sounds were noted in the left lower lobe.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender and nondistended.
Extremities revealed no evidence of edema.
Head CT revealed right frontotemporal swelling consistent with contusion, no evidence of blood, no new change compared with a previous CT done on [**2155-1-30**].
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 112.
No changes from her baseline.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  PROBLEM #1:  Fever:  The etiology of the patient's fever was considered likely aspiration pneumonia given her history of self-discontinuing her nasogastric tube during her previous hospital stay.
She was noted to be afebrile with good oxygen saturations in room air with no subjective complaints of shortness of breath or cough.
PROBLEM #2:  Neurologic:  The patient was admitted with a questionable history of altered mental status.
The etiology of the patient's mental status changes is likely multifactorial including her cerebral edema and intracranial hemorrhage, infection, hyponatremia on admission, as well as her underlying dementia.
Her hyponatremia resolved with intravenous hydration.
The patient was noted to be possibly more dysphagic and dysarthric during this hospital stay and was reevaluated by Neurosurgery who felt that these symptoms were unchanged from her previous hospitalization.
A repeat head CT was performed on [**2155-2-11**] which showed no change in her intracerebral hemorrhage.
Given that there were no changes noted on the repeat CT, no further workup is being initiated at this time.
PROBLEM #3:  Cardiovascular:  The patient was admitted with a history of atrial fibrillation and diffuse ST elevations noted on [**2155-2-6**].
A decision was made not to anticoagulate the patient given her recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The patient had stable tachycardia and was rate controlled with a beta blocker.
The patient had an echocardiogram performed on [**2155-2-7**] which was significant for an ejection fraction over 55 percent, borderline pulmonary artery hypertension, and no evidence of pericardial effusion.
Given the concern for myocardial infarction, with her ST elevations on electrocardiogram, the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with bicardiac enzymes.
Their study was significant for overt signs and symptoms of aspiration with all consistencies assessed.
The patient's cognitive deficits were considered likely contributors to her decreased bolus manipulation and swallow initiation.
The patient was also admitted with hyponatremia which resolved with intravenous fluids.
During the esophagogastroduodenoscopy, she was noted to have mild gastritis and erosions, and her H2 blocker was switched to a proton pump inhibitor.
Atrial fibrillation.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Diabetes mellitus type II.
