No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage in the bifrontal regions, also with subdural hemorrhage layering along the falx, the tentorium and along the right occipital region.
Non-displaced right occipital bone fractures with associated pneumocephalus.
Transverse/oblique right temporal bone fracture involving the mastoid air cells with opacification of the mastoid air cells, the middle ear, and external auditory canal.
Dedicated temporal bone CT is recommended for further evaluation and to evaluate for ossicular injury.
Findings raise the possibility of rheumatoid arthritis and clinical correlation recommended.
Evidence of old trauma.
Degenerative changes and old trauma makes evaluation for subtle nondisplaced acute fractures difficult.
Multiple foci of linear lucencies are identified as described above, which could represent old fractures.
In this patient with multiple other injuries, MRI would be recommended to evaluate for evidence of acute cervical injury.
Left occipital bone fracture with associated pneumocephalus.
Right temporal bone fracture with opacification of mastoid air cells in the middle ear and external auditory canal as seen on CT head.
Numerous bilateral rib fractures, minimally displaced, without evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary contusion.
Tiny right pleural right pleural effusion.
Transverse process fractures in the lumbar spine.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease without evidence of vascular injury.
Bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.
Extensive degenerative changes with moderate spinal stenosis at C3-4 level with extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord and increased signal within the cord, indicating myelomalacia or cord edema.
Extensive degenerative changes at the craniocervical junction with degenerative pannus indenting the thecal sac resulting in mild spinal stenosis.
Multilevel degenerative changes at other levels as described above.
No MRI evidence of ligamentous disruption.
Although evaluation for subtle fractures would be difficult on MRI, no obvious abnormalities are seen on recent CT.  LUMBAR SPINE:  TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial images of the lumbar spine were acquired.
FINDINGS: At T10-11, T11-12 and T12-L1, mild degenerative change is seen.
The L1 vertebra demonstrates moderate compression with mild retropulsion of the posterior superior portion.
There is no evidence of increased signal seen on the inversion recovery images indicative of chronic compression.
At L1-2, L2-3 and L3-4, degenerative disc disease identified with mild bulging.
At L3-4, there is a small protrusion within the inferior portion of right foramen with mild narrowing.
At L4-5, disc bulging and facet degenerative changes are identified resulting in mild spinal stenosis.
There is a disc protrusion in the right foramen deforming the exiting right L4 nerve root.
At L5-S1 level, severe facet degenerative changes have resulted in mild spondylolisthesis of L5 over S1.
A disc protrusion in the left foramen results in severe foraminal narrowing.
No evidence of acute fracture in the lumbar region.
Chronic compression fracture of L1 vertebra identified with mild retropulsion.
Disc protrusion in the right foramen at L4-5 and in the left foramen at L5-S1 level deforming the exiting right L4 and left L5 nerve roots respectively.
Mild spinal stenosis at L4-5 level.
Multilevel degenerative changes at other levels as above.
[**2125-1-17**] RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color, and pulse wave Doppler of the right upper extremity were performed to evaluate for deep venous thrombosis.
The right basilic vein contains occlusive thrombus along a several centimeter segment.
He was admitted to the Trauma Service and underwent CT imaging showing bilateral subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhages, right mastoid fracture, right lateral rib fractures, L1 transverse process fracture, L2 severe compression fracture of undetermined chronicity.
He also was noted to have a scalp laceration which was stapled.
ENT was consulted for right temporal bone fracture and recommended Cipro otic drops x 7 days and follow up as an outpatient with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**4-16**] weeks for audiogram.
Because of his injuries he did have pain control issues, the Acute Pain service was consulted for epidural catheter placement.
He is being treated for a pneumonia with 2 week course of Vancomycin and Zosyn.
A PEG was placed for nutritional support given that he failed his bedside swallow evaluation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Fall Traumatic brain injury Right rib fracture Pneumonia Malnutrition Right basilic vein thrombus  Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, pain adequately controlled.
Followup Instructions: Follow up in 4 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Trauma surgery.
