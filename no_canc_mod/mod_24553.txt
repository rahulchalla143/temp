Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a 60% stenosis proximally, and a 70% stenosis in the mid portion at the bifurcation of D3.
The RCA had a 95% proximal stenosis at the conus, and was occluded in the mid portion.
The distal RCA was a large vessel with posterior ventricular branches filling via extensive left-to-right collaterals from the LAD and LCX.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate to severe systemic arterial hypertension with central aortic pressures of 175/70mm Hg.
[**2133-10-14**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA with no stenosis.
[**2133-10-15**] Echo: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a centrally directed jet of mitral regurgitation that is at least mild to moderate but does border on moderate.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Cardiac catheterization revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease and she was referred for surgical intervention.
Vancomycin was given for perioperative antibiotics.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for hemodynamic monitoring.
