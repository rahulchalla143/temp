She had presented there with back pain on the R side x 2-3 days, which was not relieved by flexeril.
Pt is poor historian and unable to provide much detail other than she was having back pain.
MRI spine was performed and revealed abscess at L2-L3 level with phlegmon L4-L5-S1, no cord compression.
Blood cultures from [**2140-6-7**] from OSH grew gram negative rods, which were pan-sensitive and gram positve cocci.
Past Medical History: 1) Intravenous drug use:  cocaine, reported last use 1-2 weeks age 2) Hypertension 3) Hypothyroidism 4) Anxiety 5) Depression 6) h/o iron deficiency anemia 2 years ago, requiring transfusions adn weekly iron infusions x3mo 7) Status post R knee surgery for OA, torn meniscus, [**2136**] 8) Status post L ankle surgery with pin placement for fracture, [**2106**] 9) Status post cholecystectomy, [**2102**] 10) C-section, [**2102**]  Social History: Pt lives with her husband and is his caretaker as he is a double amputee.
Physical Exam: T99.4, BP 126/77, P84, R18, O2sat 95%, BS 163 Gen: NAD, obsese HEENt:  NC/AT, conjunctiva clear, MMM Chest: CTAB Cor: RRr, nl S1/S2, no murmur Abdomen: +BS, soft, mildly tender in LLQ, nontender Ext: trace pedal edema.
Ventrally located epidural process along the L2 and L3 vertebral bodies with mild associated mass effect, likely a combination of phelgmon and abscess.
Enhancing mass located intradurally along the posterior aspect at the L4, L5 and S1 levels with appearance suggestive of inflammatory - infectious change/phlegmon.
[**2140-6-10**] ECHO Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Post-operatively the patient was persistently agitated and required frequent doses of IV Ativan and Dilaudid.
She remained afebrile and other than mild tachycardia was hemodynamically stable.
Given concern for substance abuse withdrawal and poor mental status in setting of known bacteremia, the patient was transferred to the MICU.
It was felt that the source of her infection was likely related to IVDU.
There was a question of endocarditis as the source for seeding; however, there was no notable murmur on exam and a TTE failed to show any valvular abnormalities.
Anemia, microcytic: Pt had no sign of active bleed.
Iron studies appeared to be c/w anemia of chronic disease.
