[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: 3.4 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: 3.9 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm) Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.1 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 0.9 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)  Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 0.9 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.6 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 3.2 cm Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: 0.30 (nl >= 0.29) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 55% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Valve Level: *3.8 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm) Aorta - Ascending: *3.6 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.8 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.8 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 1.2 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 0.67 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 160 msec  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  Patient unable to cooperate with Valsalva manuever; therefore unable evaluate for inducible outflow tract gradient.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Mild (grade I) diastolic dysfunction.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild diastolic dysfunction.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild aortic dilation.
Inability to assess for inducible left ventricular outflow tract gradient given inability of patient to perform Valsalva manuever.
No cardiac etiology of syncope identified.
FINDINGS: Contusions in the paramedian inferior frontal lobes have minimally increased in size.
Subdural hematoma layering over the left frontal, parietal and temporal convexities as well as the left tentorium is relatively unchanged.
Mild increase in extra-axial space overlying right frontal and parietal convexities.
Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage is also stable.
The ventricles are unchanged in size and there is mild layering interventricular hemorrhage.
A non-displaced fracture of the right temporal bone is unchanged and the right mastoid air cells are moderately opacified.
Mild interval increase in paramedian bifrontal lower lobe contusion.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
Right bundle-branch block.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
stenosis CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  REASON: Syncope.
IMPRESSION: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
A syncope w/u was performed to include Echo and EKG as well as carotid duplex.
He had a swallow eval during his stay and their recommendations for a regular diet with thin liquids/ whole pills in puree, were followed.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: right temporal fracture left parietal and left frontal sub dural hematoma   Discharge Condition: neurologically stable   Discharge Instructions: HEAD INJURY  ??????
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation ??????
New onset of tremors or seizures ??????
Any confusion or change in mental status ??????
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities ??????
Pain or headache that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medication ??????
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage ??????
You should follow up with your primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 2 weeks of discharge - you had a 'syncope work up' while here and your PCP should review this results.
