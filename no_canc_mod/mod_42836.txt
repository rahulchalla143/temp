Brief Hospital Course: 58 yo male with history of recent C5 spinous process fracture, atrial fibrillation, PEs, and tricuspid valve endocarditis admitted for alcohol [**Month/Day (2) **], atrial fib with RVR and respiratory distress.
Respiratory Distress: Given the patient was afebrile, felt was likely aspiration pneumonitis, and patient was started on Levofloxacin/Flagyl on [**1-8**] for aspiration pneumonia.
He completed a 5 day course of levofloxacin for pneumonia empirically and improved.
Atrial Fibrillation: Most likely was in rapid ventricular response secondary to increased catecholamine surge from [**Month/Day (4) **].
Hepatitis:  He was noted to have a transaminitis on admission thought secondary to alcohol given AST to ALT ratio in addition to Hep C.  He had relatively preserved synthetic function and lft's improved to normal during his course..  5.
