History of Present Illness: This is a 49-year-old patient who sustained a gunshot injury to the right chest.
There, further investigations with x-rays revealed the bullet had traversed through the right hemithorax(chest tubed placed) across the heart and lodged itself into the left heart border and he was transferred emergently to the [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for further exploration and repair.
Past Medical History: +ETOH, DM, HTN, ?
Pertinent Results: TEE [**8-23**] Focused Study for Chest Closure and Ongoing Pressor Requirement: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is a muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) just below the prosthetic tricuspid valve with left to right flow.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
[**2187-8-31**] Chest and ABD CT Scan: 1.Small apical right pneumothorax.
2.Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis; however, infection cannot be excluded, especially at the left lung base.
3.Small fluid collection inferior to the cecum with high density material concerning for extravasation of oral contrast.
Associated focal wall thickening of the cecum which may be due to colitis: infections or inflammatory.
Wedge-shaped hypodense lesion within segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] of the liver, likely representing repaired liver laceration.
Small amount of perihepatic free fluid.
Open anterior abdominal wall wound with a small amount of fluid or stranding inferiorly in the anterior abdominal wall.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2187-8-28**]):       SERRATIA MARCESCENS.
Continued low lung volumes with bibasilar effusions and atelectasis.
No definite pulmonary edema.
Left apical pleural cap again is seen, representing a loculated, possibly extrapleural fluid collection related to the recent rib fracture.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted from an outside hospital and went emergently to the OR after sustaining gunshot wound to the chest.
He was bleeding from his chest tubes and required multiple blood products and returned to the OR for abd and chest washout, repair of diaphragmatic bleeder.
Returned from OR continued to be hypotensive, elevated transaminases, chest and abd open and wound vac in place.
He developed Rapid afib and received amiodarone with good effect.
Abdominal wound remained open and packed.
He spiked fevers and became bacteremic.
He grew Serratia from his blood and STENOTROPHOMONAS and ENTEROBACTER from sputum on [**8-28**].
He developed drainage upper aspect of abd wound and was brought back to the OR by ACS.
He returned a few days later for abd wound closure but the skin remained open.
He developed acute renal failure peak creatinine 2.5. and was therefore gently diuresed.
He was noted to have developed a pressure sore to the back of his head for which he was seen by wound nurse and place in foam mattress.
He has remained very weak and deconditioned.
He developed c-diff and was started on PO Vanco which he had completed.
He became hyponatremic which has been slowly improving and was placed on fluid and free water restriction and meds were adjusted.
He has remained afebrile and will continue on bactrim until [**9-14**].
All his wounds are healing well, his abdominal wound has several retention sutures and a vac in place to assist with wound healing.
