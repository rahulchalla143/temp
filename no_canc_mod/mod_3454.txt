: NSR at 95 bpm, NA, NI, early R wave progression, no acute ST or TW changes compared to prior [**2134-5-4**].
This could represent infectious or inflammatory colitis as noted on the prior examinations.
Nodular shrunken liver, splenomegaly and mild simple ascites consistent with sequalae of liver disease.
Small amount of perihepatic and perisplenic ascites.
Gallstones, without evidence of cholecystitis.
No augmentation of the left politeal [**2-10**] pain with squeezing.
NO DVT demonstrated.
CXR [**6-8**]: Prelim, no focal consolidations .
MRI LLE [**6-10**]: XXXXXX  Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 48-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis (non responsive to therapy) c/b jaundice, ascites, ?epatic encephalopathy and vaginal varices (no esophageal varices in [**2132**]), HTN, DM, chronic diarrhea, recent [**Hospital1 18**] admission for abd pain attributed to cdiff now presents with AMS, ARF, and lower extremity pain and swelling.
#Hepatitic encephalopathy: The patient presented with altered mental status, most c/w with hepatic encephalopathy given asterixis and somnolence.
Etiology also include cellulitis and colitis.
#Left lower leg swelling: Tender and red, c/w cellultis with nidus likely chronic ulcer on left tibial with purpulence.
Is diabetic and at risk for pseudomonas and hosptializaions make her at risk for other resistant organisms.
Treated cellitis with vancomycin (to cover staph) and cefepime (to cover GNRs from wound culture).
MRI negative for osteomyelitis, fascititis or abscess.
Likely source vaginal given h/o vaginal bleeding secondary to vaginal varices.
Per OB-GYN, vaginal bleeding can be monitored by the number of sanitary pads that need to be changed.
No known gastric varices.
On [**2134-6-10**], the patient's Hct 23 and mildly hypotensive overnight so she was transfused one unit pRBC.
In the afternoon, soaked through one pad with vaginal bleeding but also passed ~50-75cc clotted blood from vaginal vault so given another unit pRBC.
#ARF: Patient admitted multiple times with ARF though to be pre-renal responsive to colloids.
Likely hypovolemic/prerenal in setting of infection with ongoing diuretics.
The patient was also treated for hepatorenal syndrome with albumin challenge, midodrine and octreotide per above.
# Cdiff: Has history of Cdiff documented by PCR [**5-19**], s/p course of PO vanc(months ago), and recent month long course flagyl.
Admission CT scan shows worsening colitis.
Abdominal exam without tenderness.
Tolerated regular food & Tube feeds without pain or worsening diarrhea.
# H/o heroin abuse: On methadone maintance, continue for now .
# Depression/Anxiety: Continued lexapro.
Blood pressure, mental status, and renal failure improved and she was transferred to the floor under the hepatology service on [**2134-6-11**].
The transplant service continued to follow closely given her high MELD and possible infectious sources (lower extremity cellulitis & colitis) which would potentially preclude liver transplant at this time.
Opinions from the hepatologists and transplant surgeons were that she was high risk, but appropriate for transplant.
She received plasma pharesis on [**2134-6-14**] and was then taken to the OR for a planned liver transplant and splenectomy.
At this point she was also noted to have massive bleeding (>1.5 liters) through the NGT.
Once she had an appropriate blood pressure through the aid of a combination of vasopressor and blood products, the [**Doctor First Name **] clamp was replaced on the hepatic veins, partially occluding the IVC.
The diffuse bleeding was persistent and no predominant source could be identified.
Ultimately, the patient progressed to PEA and after more than 20 minutes of ACLS protocol, she was pronounced dead at [**2061**].
