Admission Date:  [**2129-8-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2129-8-28**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86 year old female with a history of peptic ulcer disease and CVA who presented to an outside hospital the day prior to death with hypotension of 40/palp, unresponsiveness.
She rapidly developed respiratory failure and hypotension was refractory to four pressor agents.
Over the subsequent six hours patient developed increasing hypoxemia, acidemia, was intubated for airway control and continued on aggressive IV fluids rehydration and multiple pressor agents.
She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further care for presumed septic shock.
Pupils were 5 mm and sluggishly reactive.
Heart sounds were mildly distant, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs appreciated.
Lungs had scattered expiratory wheezes, but no rales or rhonchi.
Abdomen was soft and nondistended with decreased bowel sounds.
There was 1+ pitting edema throughout.
UA was notable for trace leukocyte esterase, large blood, 21 to 50 red cells, no white cells, no nitrite, trace ketones.
She had CT of her head which showed no hemorrhage, but chronic microvascular change.
CT of the chest showed bilateral infiltrates and small effusion.
Chest x-ray was read as anterior consolidation, collapse of the left lower lobe, ill-defined perihilar opacities and possible right pleural effusion.
The latest EKG at 17:30 showed multifocal atrial tachycardia at 120, normal axis, normal QRS, normal QT, decreased voltage in limb leads, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in leads 2, 3 and aVF.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Over the course of hospitalization, the patient developed progressive acidemia with pH dropping to 6.8 with refractory hypoxemia despite aggressive oxygenation with PO2 of 30 and oxygen saturation of 60.
Patient's hypotension remained refractory to triple pressors.
Septic shock.
Myocardial infarction.
