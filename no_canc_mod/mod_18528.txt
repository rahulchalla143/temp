Admission Date:  [**2154-9-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-10-11**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Penicillins / Zocor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Transferred with STEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Intraaortic balloon pump placement Arterial line placement Swan-Ganz catheter placement  History of Present Illness: 84 year old male with PMH of CAD, hx MI ([**2134**]), DM, presented to OSH ED with N/V and SOB x a few days.
EKG showed ST elevations in V2 with Qs in II and aVF and hyperacute T waves in V3 with ST depression in V5-6.
He also had a transaminitis, a Cr of 1.8 and a U/A positive for Leuk Esterase and WBCs.
Here he underwent a cardiac catheterization where he was found to have a total occlusion of the mid LAD, subtotal occlusions of the LCx, and a diffusely calcified RCA.
A balloon was passed and inflated in the mid LAD but unable to pass 80% stenosis distally.
No stent placed secondary to ASA allergy.
Hemodynamics demonstrated increased filling pressures with decreased CO/CI.
The pt was started on dobutamine and IABP for cardiogenic shock.
Past Medical History: Prostate CA (brachytherapy) NIDDM CAD s/p MI ([**2134**])   Social History: Married, HCP nephew and [**Name2 (NI) 802**]  Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: 96, HR 99, BP 97/45, RR 31 100% O2 Gen: Pale, minimally responsive man in bed HEENT: Perrla, EOMI, MMM CV: RRR S1,S2 Holosystolic murmur, No R/G Lung: Rales Abd: Soft, NT, ND, BSNA Ext: No C/C/E Skin: No lesions Neuro: CN II-XII intact, A and O x 3  Pertinent Results: Echo [**2154-9-22**]: LV EF 20% severely dilated LV RV severely depressed fxn.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant patient revealed severe two vessel CAD.
The LMCA had calcifications and minor distal lesion.
The LCX had diffuse non flow limiting disease but the OM1 had subtotal occlusion and filled from collaterals from the distal LCX.
Hemodynamics revealed severe elevation of right and left filling pressures with PCWP of 29mmHG and mean RA of 15mmHG.
Insertion of IABP for hemodynamic support.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 84 year old male with PMH of CAD (S/P MI), DM admitted with STEMI [**2-13**] occluded mid LAD complicated by cardiogenic shock on IABP for BP support and PO amio for rapid atrial fibrillation, unable to be weaned off pressors and eventually made comfort measures only.
1) Cardiogenic shock - As per the HPI, the patient was initially put on IABP for pressure support post-catheterization but became hypotensive and was found to have severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.5cm).
He was unable to be weaned off these medications, and after a long course, decided to stop the IV pressors and become comfort measures only.
2) S/P STEMI - He had a difficult PTCA to mid LAD only, with cath complicated by difficulty passing wire.
3) New onset atrial fibrillation - This was treated with amiodarone.
4) Infection - He was treated with levofloxacin 250 daily for a UTI, then vancomycin, ceftaz, and flagyl for empiric coverage.
Cultures never grew any organisms, and the antibiotics were stopped when he was made CMO.
5) GI Bleed - He had guaiac positive stool on exam at his first cath on [**9-22**], but his Hct remained stable.
6) Acidosis - Near the end of his hospitalization, he was found to have both an anion and nonanion gap acidosis.
These were thought to be secondary to renal failure, with contribution from starvation ketoacidosis and possibly lactic acidosis.
7) DM - He was maintained on insulin SS for tight BS control until made CMO.
