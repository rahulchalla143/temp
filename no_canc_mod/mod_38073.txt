Right AV fistula in place.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]

Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-4-2**], the left ventricular cavity is slightly larger and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of endocarditis.
LIMITED ULTRASOUND EXAMINATION OF THE RIGHT FOREARM IN THE REGION OF THE AV FISTULA: Arteriovenous fistula is identified with appropriate aliasing on color flow images and appropriate Doppler flow.
No fluid collections were identified abutting or in the region around the fistula.
There is no soft tissue edema.
IMPRESSION: Appropriate flow within the AV fistula with no evidence of fluid collection or abscess.
Left inguinal hernia containing normal-appearing loops of small bowel.
Multiple bilateral renal cysts appear unchanged, with single exophytic left renal lower pole lesion, possibly representing a prior RF ablation site.
Stable cardiomegaly and diffuse atherosclerotic involvement of the abdominal aorta and its branches.
Cholelithiasis with gallbladder wall thickening, unchanged.
Anasarca with mild increase in intra-abdominal free fluid.
CT HEAD No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 65 year old man with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with EF 20%, diabetes, and end stage renal disease on hemodialysis who presents with mental status changes and fever, found with streptococcal septicemia due to Strep Viridans.
