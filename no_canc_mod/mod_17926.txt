Admission Date:  [**2187-12-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-1-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-3-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Erythromycin Base / Cephalosporins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**] Chief Complaint: Fall from standing  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2187-12-28**]: Flexible bronchoscopy [**2187-12-1**]: Open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair [**2187-12-17**]: Percutaneous tracheostomy placement   History of Present Illness: 69 year old woman with multiple medical problems now presenting on transfer from an OSH with a C-2 cervical fracture.
She suffered a fall from standing.
Immediately after the fall, she felt a pain in the back of her neck.
Initial trauma workup revealed widened mediastinum on chest x ray.
Follow-up CT of the torso was consistent with leaking infrarenal AAA.
In further questioning of the family, we found she also was complaining of abdominal pain increasing in intensity radiating to the back.
Past Medical History: -diabetes -COPD -anxiety -high blood pressure -s/p knee replacement -s/p abdominal hernias and surgery -h/o pneumonia -h/o recent leg cellulitis  Social History: -lives by self -walks with walker -no tobacco or alcohol use  Physical Exam: Admission exam 97.5  66  153/98  28  96%ra General: no acute distress Neck:  in hard collar, trachea midline Lungs:  decreased breath sounds at the bases CV: regular rate and rhythm; no murmur/rub Abdomen:  mildly tender to palpation diffusely, multiple reducible incisional hernias no rebound.
Multiple healed abdominal scars Ext: warm, no edema.
5.8 x 6.3 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring approximately 10 cm in length.
There is at least one focus of extraluminal contrast which is likely contained in the wall.
All branches of the abdominal aorta remain patent.
The inferior mesenteric artery originates from the inferior aspect of the aneurysm.
Mediastinal widening on previous chest x-ray was likely related to an overabundance of mediastinal fat and bilateral dependent atelectasis.
Left lower quadrant abdominal hernia as described above.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2187-12-1**] 1:04 PM IMPRESSION: Mildly displaced acute C2 fracture extending through both lateral masses and into the posteroinferior portion of the odontoid.
CT lacks soft tissue contrast resolution to exclude ligamentous injury or disk or hematoma compromising the canal.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2187-12-1**] 1:04 PM IMPRESSION: No fractures, no acute intracranial hemorrhage ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2187-12-1**] 7:40 PM IMPRESSION: Marked widening of the mediastinum concerning for mediastinal hematoma and possible aortic injury in the setting of trauma.
Small right pleural effusion and adjacent lung opacity.
In this patient that is post open repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, there is absent perfusion of the right kidney.
No evidence of pneumatosis, as clinically questioned.
Mild left colonic wall thickening and mildly dilated loops of small bowel, which are nonspecific findings, however, can be seen in the setting of bowel ischemia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectases ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT  [**2187-12-13**] 8:12 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease including severe hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this examination.
No biliary duct dilatation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2187-12-26**] 10:42 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
New, nonhemorrhagic pericardial effusion; no evidence of tamponade.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Atherosclerotic aortic arch ulcer; aortic contour unchanged since [**2187-12-2**].
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Evidence of chronic microvascular infarction.
New, partial opacification and possible fluid level within the left mastoid air cells.
This could represent mastoiditis in the appropriate clinical setting.
Symmetric LVH with preserved global systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.
Compared with the focused TEE study of [**2187-12-2**] (images reviewed), the LV systolic function has improved, and there is now a pericardial effusion, as described above.
Given the lack of deviation of the left main stem bronchus it is felt to likely represent an underlying consolidation with superimposed pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted after initial evaluation in trauma ED for emergent ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of vascular surgery.
Her course in the intensive care unit was remarkable for development of ischemic colitis following the operation that resolved with conservative management.
She remained ventilator dependent and the decision to perform a tracheostomy was made.
Tube feedings were intitiated via NGT (PEG deferred secondary to abdominal operations).
Infectious issues were a ventilator associated pneumonia with respiratory cultures revealing proteus from [**12-7**].
Later in her hospitalization urine cultures revealed yeast, proteus and klebsiella for which she was treated as well.
A mild leukocytosis developed the week of planned discharge with no evident source on work-up.
Her wounds were healing well without complications.
Cardiology evaluated the patient on [**2187-12-28**] for a small pericardial effusion seen on echocardiography.
The patient was asymptomatic from this and it was deemed that no further work-up was necessary unless hypotension developed.
Please follow intermittent CBC to monitor mild leukocytosis and stable anemia.
