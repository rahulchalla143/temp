Her partner called for help and the patient was pulled from the water and CPR was initiated by a civilian.. EMS came and was found to be in PEA arrest and was intubated in the field.
Past Medical History: Diabetes Type II - oral meds COPD - takes "inhaler" ASTHMA Arthritis - darvocet H/o prior pneumonia requiriing hospitalization .
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: On admission: T: 92.5  BP: 154/88  HR: 63   sating 100% VENT: 450/20  50%fiO2 PIP:29  PEEP:4  overbreathing @ 30/min GEN: sedated HEENT: NCAT CV: rrr s1, s2, no M/G/R RESP: CTA anteriorly ABD: soft NT/ND, no massses EXT: no edema NEURO: minimally responsive pupils, no corneal reflex, no response to painful stimuli, no response to voice  Pertinent Results: Notable labs: .
# CXR [**2185-10-11**] 7:06 PM IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Low lung volumes.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Please note an MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of acute ischemia.
Diffuse sinus disease with air-fluid levels within the right maxillary and right sphenoid sinus which may relate to water inhalation or acute sinusitis.
No definite acute fracture or malalignment identified.
Questionable hypoattenuating left thyroid lesion likely represents a benign nodule.
Echo [**2185-10-12**] Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is newly apparent absence of distinction between the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter throughout both cerebral hemispheres, consistent with widespread anoxic brain injury.
There is also relative hypodensity and effacement of sulci throughout both cerebral hemispheres, suggesting swelling.
In addition, there is new hypodensity of the lentiform nuclei bilaterally, consistent with recent infarcts.
The ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses are largely opacified and air-fluid levels and mucosal thickening are present among the maxillary sinuses.
Findings consistent with global ischemic brain injury.
Considerable opacification among the paranasal sinuses, which can be seen in intubation.
However, if the patient develops signs or symptoms of infection, the possibility of sinusitis could be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 58 y/o female s/p PEA and near drowning admitted to the MICU intubated and sedated.
Per story, appear syncopal event occured prior to her drowning episode, so can postuale that it was vaso-vagal, hypoglycmeia, or priamry arrhythmic event leading to drowining and hypoxia, leading to PEA.
No known underlying coronary disease.
-CK/Trop: anticipate elevation was [**1-28**] CPR, trended downwards - Echo was normal -serial neurologic exam showed little change -evidence for end organ perfusion problems from elevated lactate.
# Metabolic Acidosis: lactic acid from end organ ischemia.
# Neurologic Deficits: Weened proprofol without improvement of exam.
Neuro consulted and EEG showed that pt did have some seizure activity, which resolved with propofol.
-Head CT consistent with diffuse anoxic brain damage, and incompatable with consciousness.
- prognosis was presented to family, and after much discussion decided to make pt [**Name (NI) 3225**] in accordance to the patients wishes.
