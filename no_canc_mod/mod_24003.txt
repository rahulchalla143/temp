CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2167-5-11**] 4:39 AM  Final Report INDICATION: 45-year-old male with cerebellar bleed.
FINDINGS: There is a large irregular-shaped hyperdense collection in the posterior fossa.
Hyperdense products track along the tentorium and posterior portion of the brainstem.
In addition, there is slight increase in blood products within the bilateral occipital horns and third ventricle.
There is surrounding edema and effacement of the cerebellar folia and mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
No major vascular territory infarction.
Mild bilateral ethmoid mucosal thickening.
IMPRESSION: Overall, no change in large irregular-shaped posterior fossa hemorrhage compared to the prior study.
Slight increase in intraventricular blood products in the bilateral occipital horns, with slight increase in the diameter of the lateral ventricles compared to the prior study.
Mild unchanged tonsillar and ascending transtentorial herniation.
CTA should be consider to rule out underlying vascular lesion or mass.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2167-5-11**] 6:04 AM   FINDINGS:  CTA HEAD: There has been no significant interval change in the large irregular-shaped hyperdense collection within the posterior fossa when compared with the prior non-contrast CT examination performed earlier the same day, [**2167-5-11**] at 4:55 a.m. Hyperdense blood products are again seen layering along the tentorium and posterior portion of the brainstem.
There is intraparenchymal hemorrhage surrounding the ventriculostomy catheter with greatest dimension 4.3 cm AP x 2.5 cm transverse in the right frontal lobe and new mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
There is no significant shift of the normally midline structures.
There has been interval increase in intraventricular blood products within the right lateral ventricle.
Again seen is effacement of the perimesencephalic cisterns with probable mild right-sided uncal herniation.
There is no cerebellar tonsillar herniation.
There is no evidence of acute territorial infarction.
The vertebrobasilar system is diminutive but patent, which may be reflective of arterial vasospasm.
The posterior cerebral arteries are patent but diminutive, which also may be secondary to vasospasm.
There is no evidence of flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm greater than 2 mm, or arteriovenous malformation.
The common, internal, and external carotid arteries are normal in course and caliber without evidence of flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or dissection.
There are biapical atelectatic changes.
Cross-sectional analysis of the internal carotid arteries is as follows.
Stable appearance of the large irregularly shaped posterior fossa intraparenchymal hemorrhage when compared with the previous examination.
No evidence of aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation to suggest etiology of this hematoma.
Status post right frontal approach ventriculostomy shunt catheter placement with surrounding intraparenchymal hematoma and new mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
Interval increase in intraventricular blood products.
Recommend continued short term interval follow-up.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2167-5-12**] 4:10 AM   FINDINGS: The patient is status post suboccipital craniectomy and evacuation of a left cerebellar hematoma.
Pneumocephalus in the posterior fossa and subcutaneous emphysema are expected in the setting of recent surgery.
A linear hyperdensity in the surgical bed, consistent with blood products, is new since the prior study.
Residual blood is seen in the right cerebellar hemisphere and layering along the tentorium.
There is unchanged effacement of the cerebellar folia with compression of the fourth ventricle.
There has been an interval decrease in the size of the lateral and third ventricles.
Extensive hemorrhage in the right lateral ventricle is unchanged.
There is increased blood in the left lateral and third ventricles.
The right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema, at the site of a prior ventriculostomy catheter, has not significantly changed since the prior study, allowing for differences in technique and angulation.
There is mild degree of cerebral swelling, with effacement of the quadrigeminal cistern, unchanged since prior study.
There is no evidence of an acute major vascular territorial infarction.
New blood products in the surgical site in the left cerebral hemisphere.
Slightly increased intraventricular blood.
Stable right frontal hematoma at the site of a prior ventriculostomy.

[**Known lastname 85718**],[**Known firstname 85719**] [**Medical Record Number 85720**] M  45  [**2121-7-8**]  Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2167-5-18**] 5:02 PM    CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Final Report INDICATION: Posterior fossa hemorrhage status post evacuation.
CT [**5-17**] enlarged right frontal intracranial hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: Again is noted a large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema, the hematoma measures 2.2 x 4.4 cm compared to prior 2.9 x 4.8 cm.
There is mild leftward shift of the septum pellucidum, measuring 9 mm compared to prior comparative re-measurement of 7 mm measured at (series 2, image 16).
Left cerebellar intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring 1.6 x 1.7 cm, is slightly smaller than the prior measurement of 1.7 x 1.9 cm.
Associated small subarachnoid hemorrhage along the folia is unchanged.
Additionally small subarachnoid hemorrhage is present in bilateral inferior frontal lobes (2:14, 15) and this could be due to redistribution/ new.
There is no intraventricular extension.
There are bur holes in bilateral frontal lobes.
Unchanged to slightly smaller multifocal intraparenchymal, small subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage.
Unchanged right frontal peri-hemorrhagic edema with an 8-mm leftward subfalcine herniation, slightly more prominent than prior comparative re-measurement of 7 mm.
No hydrocephalus.
Some degree of diffuse cerebral and cerebellar edema as before.
[**2167-5-20**] LENI's: IMPRESSION: No DVT.
[**2167-5-21**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Largely unchanged multifocal intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, and subdural hemorrhage with improved leftward subfalcine herniation.
No hydrocephalus or intraventricular extension.
Persistent mild cerebral edema.
No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.
Left lower lobe collapse has worsened.
Right lower lobe atelectasis is mild.
No appreciable pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt was recieved to [**Hospital1 18**] ED via [**Location (un) **] tranfer from OSH for cerebellar hemorrhage.
His blood pressure was elevated in the ED - it was noted that the CSF from the EVD had turned bloody - he was brought emergently to the CT scanner which revealed hemorrhage along the track of the right evd as well as a cerebellar AVM with hemorrhage.
The right sided EVD was removed after placment of a left frontal EVD.
The pt was brought to the ICU for recovery, sz prophylaxis and close neuro monitoring.
He was demonstrating left upper extrmeity weakness on exam.
This could be secondary to swelling and a second angio is planned.
On [**5-15**], patient spiked fevers and was pancultured.
Infectious disease was consulted for fevers which they thought his fevers were due to aspiration PNA.
Patient's CXR from [**5-22**] noted to have LLL collapse which was brought up to the SICU team.
Head CT after EVD was removed was stable and there for no evidence of hemorrhage.
On [**5-25**] a CXR was obtained which revealed worsening opacification at the left base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm.
This is consistent with increasing left lower lobe collapse and probable small pleural effusion.
On [**5-26**] a medical consult was obtained for concern regarding his CXR and they recommended no antibiotics unless patient had a fever spike of 101.5 or greater along with an elevated WBC.
He should have a CXR again in one weeks time to evaluate his pulmonary status, or sooner if a fever should develop.

o	An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or Docusate).
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
Activity is the most important measure you can take to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself again.
If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy objects, or straining at stool.
Although your surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these complications developing.
These complications include: infection, blood clots, or neurological changes.
Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory loss, or difficulty speaking.
Loss of vision, either partial or total.
Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
Severe sensitivity to light.
Severe headache or change in headache.
Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
