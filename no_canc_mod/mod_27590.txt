EGD [**4-11**]: Varices at the mid to distal esophagus (ligation) Erythema and congestion in the stomach body and fundus compatible with portal HTN gastropathy Normal mucosa in the duodenum There was a malfunction of the first set of banding equipment and the plastic tip along with unapplied bands fell off the endoscope into the stomach.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old man with history of cirrhosis of unclear [**Name2 (NI) 25100**] presents with GI bleed from grade 4 varices.
# UPPER GI BLEED - Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 66577**] was found to have grade IV esophageal varices at OSH, w/ a question of large gastric varices as well.

He underwent banding to 5 esophageal varices on [**2168-4-11**] and has been stable since.
# CIRRHOSIS - Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 66578**] laboratory evaluation revealed a pattern most consistent with cirrhosis, with elevated LFT's and compromised synthetic function.
Imaging was also consistent with cirrhosis.
Hepatology/GI was consulted and recommended a laboratory workup which revealed that Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 66577**] was hepB core Ab positive, likely representing a chronic hep B infection.
