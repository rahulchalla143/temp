Today he developed left sided chest pain, severe, radiating to the left arm, as if someone was "pushing on his chest", along with mild headache.
Specifically, no chest pain at onset of symptoms.
No recent symptoms of infection.
Chest pain and headache have resolved with treatment of hypertension (now 200s, 220s on arrival).
Past Medical History: - Hypertension, on four agents, several years standing, last clinic visit 150/90 - Hepatitis C, chronic (per Atrius records, patient did not know of this) - Overweight - Chest pain (per Atrius notes, on nitrate, none recent except for above) - Sleep apnea, untreated - Asthma - Prior depression - Possible dyslipidemia - patient unsure   Social History: Truck driver.

Posture normal and no truncal ataxia.
Toes downgoing on left and increased receptive field and equivocal on right.
No agraphesthesia, no atopesthesia.
No extinction on DSS.
No signs of pneumonia or CHF  NCHCT [**2124-5-27**]:  FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or large acute tentorial infarction.
Re-demonstrated are multifocal centrum semiovale and periventricular hypodensities likely consistent with sequela of chronic extensive small vessel disease.
No acute intracranial process.
Chronic sequela of extensive small vessel disease, unchanged from prior exam from [**2122-11-8**]  CTA Chest [**2124-5-27**]: CTA CHEST: There is no pneumomediastinum, mediastinal hemorrhage, pericardial, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Moderate atherosclerotic calcification of the left main coronary artery.
Mild cardiomegaly without edema.
The thoracic aorta is normal without evidence of dissection.
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There is no focal consolidation.
Small calcified granuloma in the LLL, no suspicious pulmonary nodules.
Small hiatal hernia.
Partially visualized upper abdomen demonstrates no acute pathology.
BONES:There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
No acute cardiothoracic process including no evidence of aortic dissection.
Mild cardiomegaly without edema.
MRI Brain and MRA head and neck [**2124-5-27**]: FINDINGS: There is an acute infarction at the left mid brain-pons junction.
Another focus of acute infarction is seen in the right posterior corona radiata.
Otherwise, the extensive small vessel ischemic changes in the white matter are stable.
There is prominent soft tissue in the adenoids, which should be clinically correlated.
MRA of the brain demonstrates no evidence for occlusion, high-grade stenosis or aneurysm.
IMPRESSION:  Acute left pontine infarction.
No significant vascular abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: In the ER, pt underwent CTA chest given complaint of chest pain, however this was negative.
MRI brain confirmed pontine infarct, consistent with his exam.
Head and neck vessel imaging was unremarkable.
On day of discharge, the pt had subtle ataxia on FNF on the right, slower finger-tap on the right, and clumsier rapid alternating movements on the right.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
5. simvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for stroke ppx.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: acute stroke  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
