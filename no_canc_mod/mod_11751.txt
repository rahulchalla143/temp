During the workup, he was found to have an incidental thoracoabdominal dissection, and now presents for a temporizing procedure prior to planned thoracoabdominal repair.

Large aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta to the right common iliac artery.
The true lumen feeds the great vessels and major abdominal arteries.
Right renal cysts.
Sacroiliac joint fusion and degenerative changes of the spine.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
4.The ascending aorta is markedly dilated There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
No dissection was seen in the limited views of the ascending aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.
All major abdominal vascular branches originate from the true lumen.
2) Stable dilatation of the ascending aorta/aortic root.
4) Multiple simple right renal cysts.
5) Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
6) Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 72M s/p urethral disruption and a rectourethral fistula after radical prostatectomy for BPH.
Pt denied symptoms and was hemodynamically stable during his entire hospital course.
Serial chest CT's showed no progression of the dissection, and cardiac surgery felt that the dissection was chronic in nature.
Pt had stool draining from both his perineal wound and foley catheter at this time.
He was started on levo/flagyl for empiric coverage.
He was tolerating a PO diet and pain was well-controlled with PO analgesia.
He was instructed to return to the hospital the following week for repair of his aortic dissection.
Please fill new medications (antibiotics levofloxacin and metronidazole, as well as multiple cardiac medications) and take as instructed.
Call your physician or go to the emergency room if you experience fever >101.4F, pain unrelieved by medication, intractable nausea or vomiting, or foul-smelling drainage from your abdominal incision.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will see you when you return to the hospital next Wednesday for your cardiac surgery.
Follow-up with your urologist on discharge regarding management of your urethrorectal fistula.
