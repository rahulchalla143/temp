His daughter states he had minor concentration problems last weekend while having a conversation and attempting to continue with a concomitant task.He has had no nausea or vomiting.
There have been no new motor or sensory deficits.
He decided to performed an MRI CNS w/o  contrast today at [**Location (un) 620**] that evidenced LARGE LEFT CEREBRAL HEMISPHERIC SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE WITH midline shift and no hydrocephalus.
He does have 50% carotid blockage on ultrasound in [**2172**].
Recent exercise stress test in which he was only able to perform 5 minutes of exercise stopping with a maximal heart rate of 132 with dyspnea and a maximal blood pressure of 210/78.
No EKG changes with exercise.
There is a history of mom[**Name (NI) 12823**] blindness occurring after being stung with wasps in the past but there is no allergic history.
His mother died at age [**Age over 90 **] with a stroke at age [**Age over 90 **].
She did have Alzheimer's disease and carotid vascular disease.
He has lost a brother and a sister to trauma.He has a brother and sister who are alive with no history of stroke and no history of coronary disease.

No masses or megalies.
Ext: no edema, no DVT data.
Neurologic examination: No meningismus.
No photophobia.
No field cuts.
No tremor, no asterixis or myoclonus.
Coordination: *Finger-nose-finger mild dysmetria on the LEFT *Rapid Arm Movements normal.
Pertinent Results: MRI at [**Location (un) **] on 3/ 25/ 09: Very large, mixed signal intensity subdural hemorrhage extending over the entire left frontal and parietal lobes, and which appears to terminate caudally at approximately the level of the left sylvian fissure.
There is a small component of this hemorrhage overlying the left occipital lobe.
The maximal thickness of the subdural hemorrhage is 27 mm.
There is pronounced effacement of the adjacent cortical sulci and approximately 7 mm right-sided subfalcine herniation,as well as compression of the left lateral ventricle.
There does not overt uncal or hippocampal herniation at this time.
on the FLAIR images are numerous subcentimeter areas of elevated T2 signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, somewhat more prominent on the right side.
While nonspecific in etiology, given patient age, chronic small vessel infarcts would appear the most probable diagnosis, as opposed to postinflammatory residua.
There is no overt extracranial abnormality detected.
On [**3-25**] he was brought to the OR where under general anesthesia he underwent left burr hole evacuation of subdural hematome.
Post op CT showed decrease in SDH and decreased shift.
His wounds were clean and dry with staples.
