[**2139-9-27**]: ECG: Sinus rhythm Long QTc interval Left axis deviation - anterior fascicular block Probable anterior myocardial infarction - age undetermined Possible old inferior infarct T wave inversion in V2-V6- consider ischemia Nonspecific T wave flattening in limb leads Since previous tracing, QRS changes in V6 - ?
[**2139-9-27**]: CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality .
[**2139-9-28**]: carotid ultrasound: Duplex ultrasonography was performed at the level of the cervical portions of the bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries.
The velocities, waveforms and velocity ratio in the bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries were normal, with antegrade flow.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with preservation of the basal lateral and basal posterior walls.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen .
Initial access was extremely difficult due to severe tortuosity of the right iliac artery.
Selective coronary angiography of the left circulation demonstrated a 95% thrombotic stenosis in the mid-LAD with serial 90% and 80%  stenoses in the LCX.
Final angiography demonstrated no dissections, no residual stenoses, and TIMI-3 flow in both vessels.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan:  Now s/p PCI with stenting of LAD and LCx.
Has remained stable and chest pain free throughout hospitalization.
CAD: 57 year old male with PMH hyperlipidemia, obesity admitted with acute anterior MI and newly diagnosed three vessel disease transferred for evaluation by CT surgery for potential CABG.
Pt was found to have a recent anterior MI with peak troponin of 1700.
Pt had PCI with stenting of LAD and LCx.
Pt remained stable and chest pain free throughout hospitalization.
Pump: Pt was found to have severe global hypokinesis on echo.
Pt was started on medical management of his heart failure with a long-acting beta-blocker and ACE.
We recommend rechecking echo in 3 months, if still has EF<30% in setting of CAD would recommend ICD placement.
