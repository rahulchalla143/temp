no etoh  Family History: No CAD   Physical Exam: Alert and oriented x3 NAD RRR CTA b/l Abd soft, nondistended LE warm and pink bilaterally.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2170-11-1**]):  POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.
CXR:  FINDINGS: Aortic stent graft remains in place within a right-sided aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
Increasing left effusion with adjacent left basilar atelectasis.
New patchy opacity at right base which may reflect acute aspiration, atelectasis, and less likely developing infection.
Small right pleural effusion has also increased.
CTA:  FINDINGS: Right-sided aortic arch is seen with left subclavian artery as the first branch arising from the aortic arch.
At the level of the distal part of the arch, beginning of the descending thoracic aorta, there is pseudoaneurysm in the left anterior direction.
No active extravasation is seen.
Bilateral pleural effusions are seen, on the right of a small amount and on the left, small to moderate amount.
The effusions are of high density with the hematocrit effect.
Findings are consistent with pleural hematoma.
Low trachea and bronchial tree are compressed from the hematoma to the AP diameter of 6 mm in the lower trachea and to the diameter of 4 mm at the level of the carina.
Further noted linear atelectases in the right lower lobe, left lower lobe and right middle lobe.
No intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile dilatation is noted.
A single lymph node is seen to the right of the celiac axis measuring 0.7 cm.
IMPRESSION: Ruptured pseudoaneurysm of a right-sided aortic arch with mediastinal hematoma and bilateral hemothoraces.
No evidence of active extravasation is seen.
Taken to the OR for TEVAR with Vascular and Cardiac surgery.
