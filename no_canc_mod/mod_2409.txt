This is consistent with lower lobe pneumonia and possible pleural effusion.
Opacification at the right base could reflect pneumonia involving the right lower lobe with possible effusion as well.
Some indistinctness of pulmonary markings raises the possibility of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
Esophageal distention due to achalasia.
Normal-appearing kidneys without evidence of abscess.
Highly irregular appearance of the urinary bladder wall with nodular thickening.
While this could represent changes related to obstructive uropathy, due to enlarged prostate, and/or chronic cystitis, further evaluation by cystoscopy is recommended.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: FINDINGS: There is severe swallow delay.
No penetration or aspiration is visualized during the study.
IMPRESSION: No penetration or aspiration on today's exam.

He was admitted on [**9-24**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with fever, lethargy and hypotension (SBP 80s); he was found to have a pneumonia (likely aspiration), and UTI (MRSA).
He did not require intubation and did not require pressors for blood pressure support.
He completed a 5 day course, and his breathing remained comfortable without evidence of ongoing infection after completion of the course.
# Chronic aspiration Pt is well known to the Speech+Swallow service, and is known to have hx of aspiration.
Pt passed video swallow, however, he is still at intermittent risk for aspiration.
Wife understands and accepts risk of aspiration with po intake.
# UTI, MRSA Pt was found to have a MRSA UTI during this admission, which is currently being treated with Linezolid due to a vancomycin allergy.
A renal ultrasound was obtained to rule out renal abscess, which was negative, but there was noted to be abnormalities on the bladder wall (see U.S. report), for which cystoscopy was recommended.
# Parkinson's Disease - continued carbidopa-levodopa.
Pt is on low dose, as he has a history of being sedated with larger doses.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and history of DVT/PE s/p IVC filter Discussed with wife, and they are not opposed to continuing warfarin and having INR followed.
# BPH, with urinary obstruction Pt was noted to have significant retention throughout the hospitalization.
