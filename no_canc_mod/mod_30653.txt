There is stable flattening of the bilateral hemidiaphragms with a relative paucity of vasculature in the left upper lung, consistent with reported history of COPD.
Stable mild bilateral blunting of the costophrenic angles may represent a small pleural effusion.
No focal opacification concerning for pneumonia identified.
Stable minimal blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles may represent small effusions versus scarring.
Somewhat late R wave progression.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 75 yo F h/o COPD on 3L with recent COPD exacerbation, HTN on [**Last Name (un) **] presenting with uvula swelling and urticaria which was concerning for allergic reaction to levofloxacin or Losartan.
# Uvula Swelling: Only new exposures include levofloxacin and prednisone.
Levofloxacin renally cleared and patient does have mildly decreased GFR, so the timing of this new medication may coincide with her reaction.
Both medications can cause an allergic reaction in less than 1 % of all noted reactions.
Patient had no dysphagia, odynophagia, dyspnea, stridor and is managing secretions without difficulty.
As noted above, it was only mildly swollen by the time she arrived to the MICU.
- Prednisone 40mg for 5 days - Famotidine and hydroxy as needed for symptomatic relief - Hold levofloxacin and losartan - [**Month (only) 116**] consider allergist referral .
# COPD: On 3 liters at baseline, however did appear in mild to moderate distress on presentation which improved with neb treatments.
She appears to have increase WOB due to her movement disorder and as per the family she was on her baseline.
She denies having any SOB prior to her discharge.
We also sent Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] an email to discuss possible starting on Azithromycin ppx for her recurrent COPD flares, although her resp appears to be at baseline.
# small Pleural Effusion: Pt appears to have a small pleural effusion on Cxray.
Her LVEF on [**5-22**] showed normal EF and normal E/E', so does not appear to have diastolic dysfunction.
Given mild respiratory distress on presentation and pleural effusion, she was given only one dose of lasix 10mg IV with good response.
# Chronic Urticaria: Has been a problem for several years per daughter.
Is seen by allergy (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2603**] and feels possibly related to chronic MGUS.
# Diabetes:  Her glucose was elevated since she was placed on steroids and her insulin sliding scale was increased while on steroids.
I also recommended that she continues with her sliding scale and call her PCP if her glucose remains elevated >300.
-Continue home lantus and HISS .
# Hypertension: Mildly hypertensive on presentation.
We continued her diltiazem, and given concern for possible allergic reaction to the losartan we then started on HCTZ.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continue pravastatin .
She has increase unintentional truncal movements consistent with her hx of tardive dyskinesia.
# Mild to moderate dementia: Noted on NeuroPsych testing in the past - Continue olanzapine and perphenazine .
# FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, eating a regular- soft diet with no difficulty # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots # Access: peripherals # Communication: Patient and daughter, [**Name (NI) 4944**]: H: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 97411**], C: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 97412**] # Code: Full (confirmed) # Disposition: home to daughter and granddaughter.
