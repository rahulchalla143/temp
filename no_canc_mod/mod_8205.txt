It is unclear when the dyspnea started, but nursing found him short of breath at 4am and called EMS.
He was noted to be agitated and tachypneic with bilateral rales on exam.
CK 255 with mildly elevated CK-MB 17 (MBI 6.7) but trop 0.41; Cr 2.6 up from baseline 1.8-2 but previous trops in OMR peaked at 0.17.
CXR showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema with possible superimposed RLL pneumonia.
ECG showed ST depressions in the precordial leads with a RBBB.
Cardiology was called due to his history of CAD but felt this was demand in the setting of tachycardia and renal failure.
He was noted to have a GI bleed in [**2104**] but Hct stable from baseline and guaiac negative so started on heparin gtt.
With Russian interpreter present, he reports feeling short of breath as well as vague chest pain.
Of note, he was recently admitted in [**5-/2108**] for evaluation of chest pain and dyspnea.
He ruled out for MI and was felt to have angina and decompensated CHF in the setting of poorly controlled and treated for CHF thought secondary to poorly controlled hypertension.

Findings concerning for recurrent chronic edema, with possible superimposed infection at the right base.
CXR [**6-14**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no substantial progression of the pre-existing severe pulmonary edema.
Massive cardiomegaly.
No evidence of left pleural effusion, on the right, the presence of mild-to-moderate pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
The lung parenchyma shows no evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 year-old man with HTN, HL, DM, CAD, CHF, PVD, CVA, and CRF p/w dyspnea and hypoxia with evidence of decompensated CHF, pneumonia, and elevated troponins.
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF - pt has EF 40-45% (on TTE in [**2106**]) and had significant pulmonary edema on admission with elevated BNP.
CXR showed pulmonary edema with possible RLL opacity.
Exacerbation of CHF likely in setting of pneumonia and NSTEMI, as below.
# Pneumonia - Patient had fever, leukocytosis with left shift, and possible RLL opacity which was concerning for HCAP given that he is a long-term facility resident with recent hospitalization 1 month ago.
Aspiration pneumonia also on differential given he is s/p CVA, dysarthric, and found to be aspirating on speech/swallow evaluation.
His WBC was rising at time of discharge but he was afebrile and breathing comfortably on shovel mask (100%) which he wore intermittently.
Though patient did not pass speech/swallow evaluation, he expressed desire to eat and was continued on feeding for comfort, despite risk of aspiration.
# NSTEMI: Pt reported vague chest and left arm pain on admission and had elevated troponins above previous baseline which continued to rise (had not peaked at time of discharge).
His ECG showed diffuse ST depressions consisted with NSTEMI.
Discussion was held with his family who did not want any aggressive measures (i.e.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 2.6 on admission above most recent baseline of 1.8, increased to 3.5.
[**Month (only) 116**] be related to decreased renal perfusion in setting of decompensated CHF which is worsened given MI.
We continued gentle diuresis with lasix drip for comfort of breathing given significant pulmonary edema and Cr should be trended on discharge.
# PAD: Continued ASA and plavix .

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 29901**],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with an infection in your lungs which may be due to aspiration of food.
You were also found to have a heart attack which likely worsened your heart failure and resulted in fluid in your lungs, which made it difficult for you to breathe.
You can restart your torsemide 10mg daily after you have enough fluid removed with the lasix drip.
