Began with URI symptoms of rhinorrhea and cough increasingly productive of gree/yellow sputum.
Denies fevers or night sweats, admits chills once or twice.
Saw PCP yesterday, who added Flovent to her COPD regimen and started treatment for UTI with Levaquin 250mg PO daily.
He also checked a CXR which had no infiltrate.
Noted to have bilateral expiratory wheezing with increased respiratory effort.
She was given SoluMedrol 125mg IV, combivent nebs, and covered for possible COPD flare with vancomycin 1gm IV, CTX 1gm IV, and Azithromycin 500mg PO.
Repeat CXR done which showed no infiltrate, no evidence of pulmonary edema.
Ddimer was positive, and she had a CTA, which demonstrated no evidence of PE or dissection, but showed peribronchial opacities potentially concerning for early multifocal PNA.
She was noted to have endovascular leak in [**10-10**] and underwent open AAA repair and RAS stent placed.

The lungs are slightly hyperinflated but there is no infiltrate.
There is some linear atelectasis at the bases.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
No evidence of PE or acute aortic syndrome.
Multiple patchy opacities in a bronchovascular pattern seen as in bilateral lungs, which are concerning for an early multifocal pneumonia with adjacent adenopathy, likely reactive.

CXR showed no infiltrate, no pulmonary edema.
D-dimer was positive, CTA did not show PE or dissection, but showed peribronchial opacities, concerning for early multifocal PNA.
She was switched to po prednisone for COPD exacerbation.
Multifocal Pneumonia:  Concerning for pneumonia on CT. Urine legionella was negative.
She remained afebrile without leukocytosis.
# Supratherapeutic INR: Likely secondary to antibiotics.
She will follow up with her PCP and have an INR check.
# Diastolic CHF: Exam with bibasilar crackles c/w some mild pulmonary edema in setting of known diastolic dysfunction.
Scheduled for outpatient elective cardioversion, but was cancelled due to her hospitalization.
# New TWI: Noted on EKGs.
# UTI: Urine grew out Klebsiella susceptible to ceftriaxone.
# h/o MRSA bacteremia: She was on vancomycin upon transfer to the Medicine floor.
