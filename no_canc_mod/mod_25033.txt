Admission Date:  [**2153-1-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-1-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-1-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital1 **] for thoracic aortic aneurysm repair  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation   History of Present Illness: 61 y/o female with COPD, PVD and critical central airway obstruction at the distal trachea (<1cm) secondary to thoracic aortic aneurysm, transferred for vascular surgery consult prior to IP intervention to determine sequence of events.
States she had had cough prior, and then noted to desaturate to low 80's while in ED there.
Pt then went into PEA, received epi and atropine, went into VT, was shocked x 1, and regained pulse w/ sinus tach.
She was treated for COPD exacerbation with solumedrol 60mg IV Q8, in addition to azithromycin and ceftriaxone due to concern for RUL infiltrate.
In addition, patient was ruled out for MI per history, with peak troponin of 0.10 at OSH (ranging 0.06-->0.10-->0.06 w/ flat CKs).
Does complain of intermittent "crampy chest pain", which she states has been going on for weeks (and nonexertional).
No radiation, no diaphoresis, no N/V.
No CP with previous MI.
Past Medical History: COPD on home O2 ?TBM PVD Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Cardiomyopathy w/ EF=35% Hypothyroidism Obesity Spinal Stenosis  Social History: Tobacco- over 20pack year history, now has quit.

Radiology  A. CXR HISTORY: Systolic CHF recently extubate, to assess for edema or infiltrate.
There is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta and evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
Probable left effusion with some bibasilar atelectatic changes.
CT chest ([**1-12**]) -- OSH read No e/o PE or aortic dissection.
Diffuse consolidated lung parenchyma with right upper lobe posteriorly and bilateral lower lobes.
Diffuse increased interstitial markings consistent w/ CHF with bilateral pleural effusions right slightly greater than left.
Aortic root measures approximately 6cm transversely at the level of the coronary vessels.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with inferior/inferolateral akinesis, inferoseptal akinesis/hypokinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

She was treated for COPD exacerbation.
# Hypercarbic and Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Patient likely had COPD exacerbation Given absence of leukocytosis, fever, pneumonia felt less likely.
Pulmonary embolism consideration but unlikely given clinical response to therapy.
She was treated with a 5-day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone (the latter for a presumed RUL pneumonia) in addition to nebs and steroid taper.
Patient will need PFTs either inpatient or outpatient for further characterization of her COPD and medical management regarding her aneurysm.
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF (EF 25-35%): Patient's ECHO is suggestive of prior myocardial infarction.
She appeared volume overloaded with pulmonary edema on CXR.
Etiology felt to be secondary to the recent PEA arrest.
# Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Patient with new 6cm thoracic aortic aneurysm, transferred for repair.
Cardiac surgery consulted and will evaluate the patient as an outpatient for elective surgery.
The decision regarding surgery was felt to be complex given her underlying multiple co-morbidities.
Her RCRI perioperative risk of MI or cardiac death is approximately 5.4 %, and medical optimization was recommended including lisinopril, statin, ASA, and beta blockade.
Definitive etiology unknown but given COPD, could have auto-PEEP or had decreased venous return during incident resulting in cardiopulmonary arrest.
She currently has a slight troponin leak, and there could have been some ischemia during the event.
Given her low EF, consideration for future ICD placement.

Diagnosis = COPD   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: COPD on home O2 TBM PVD Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Cardiomyopathy w/ EF=35% Hypothyroidism Obesity Spinal Stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital with shortness of breath.
We performed studies that determined your shortness breath is due to your underlying lung condition called COPD.
During your workup, we found that you have a thoracic aortic aneurysm which is being followed by cardiac surgery.
We treated you for the COPD exacerbation.
You have to come back for reevaluation of the thoracic aortic aneurysm which will need to be surgically fixed.
You can take small doses of Vicodin or Xanax as needed for pain or anxiety, but please do not use these together and do not take with alcohol.
