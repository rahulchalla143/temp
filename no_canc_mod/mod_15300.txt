Active Issues: # Endocarditis: The patient was transferred from an OSH where he had presented with fevers and malaise.
Exam revealed a MR murmur and blood cultures were positive for group B streptococcus.
TTE at [**Hospital1 18**] indicated a probably mitral valve vegetation, however, a TEE could not be performed due to obstruction in the hypopharynx preventing passage of scope.
Given clinical picture this was concerning for endocarditis with abscess affecting the conducting system.
On interrogation of pacer prior to discharge, patient continued to have type I second degree AV block.
# h/o arial fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which he is on warfarin.
During admission, patient had one brief episode of atrial fibrillation with normal rate, otherwise was in sinus rhythm with AV block as above.
#Diastolic congestive heart failure:  Patient had no signs of fluid overload on exam at the time of admission.
These medications were held in the setting of increasing creatinine, and no signs of volume overload.
#Urinary retention:  Patient has a history of benign prostatic hypertension.
Exam was consistent with a gouty flare.
In the setting of the patient's bactermia and acute on chronic kidney failure, pain was treated with tylenol and ultram.
It did trend upward to a maximum value of 1.7 in the setting of urinary retention.
Please evaluate for ongoing signs of urinary retention.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Group B Strep Endocarditis Second degree Heart block s/p pacemaker Chronic Diastolic congestive heart failure Acute Urinary Retention Acute Kidney Injury Atrial Fibrillation on Warfarin   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You had fevers at home and bacteria was found in your blood.
This bacteria led to an infection on your mitral valve and you will need a total of 6 weeks of antibiotics to treat this.
The infection may have caused a slow heart rhythm but it is more likely that your electrical system in your heart is aging and causing this rhythm.
You will need to see a cardiologist after the antibiotics are done to see if you will need a permanant pacemaker and to check another echocardiogram to see if the infection is done in the valve.
You had acute urinary retention after the foley was removed and a foley was placed again.
You were started on a medicine to help you empty your bladder and the foley will be taken out on [**7-30**].
Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
STart Tamsulosin to treat your urinary retention 4.
Start colace and senna as needed to prevent constipation 5.
Start terbenifine cream to treat your fungal infection between your toes 6.
Start lisinopril to treat your congestive heart failure.
