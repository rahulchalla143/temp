Went for cardiac catherization at [**Hospital1 **] which showed three vessel coronary artery disease (100% diagonal 80% left anterior descending, and 100% right coronary artery).

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include thinned and aneurysmal basal inferior/inferolateral wall, mid inferior hypokinesis/akinesis, akinetic mid to distal septum, and apical  akinesis/hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2157-9-2**] for further management of his coronary artery disease.
A carotid duplex ultrasound was performed which showed mild atherosclerotic changes bilaterally with less than 40% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed his ejection fraction to be 25%, no mitral valve regurgitation and an inferior basal aneurysm.
As Mr. [**Known lastname 16643**] hematocrit fell, a cause of his anemia was explored.
A colonoscopy was notable for only diverticula and hemorrhoids.
An esophageal duodenoscopy was notable for angioectasia which was cauterized and gastritis.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed for poor hemodynamics.
He required multiple pressors and blood products for postoperative bleeding.
He developed atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone and beta blockade.
Call for any fever, redness or drainage from wounds.
