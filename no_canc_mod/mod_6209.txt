There is a left lateral lower chest-wall hematoma.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 23195**] was admitted after acute trauma of the left chest stab wound below the nipple line on the lateral chest.
He required adjuvant support to prevent any withdrawal.
RESPIRATORY:  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 23195**] suffered a wound to his left chest giving him a left hemothorax, which needed evacuation with a left chest tube.
He has two wounds on his left chest; one is original stab wound and one is the chest-tube incision site.
Both were draining serosanguinous material, which are being treated with dry dressings as needed.
He is expected to resolve this drainage and heal these wounds secondarily without any intervention.
[**Name (NI) **] received CT scan of the abdomen with PO and IV contrast, which showed no apparent injury to solid organs or his bowel.
He is now well over the time to have a visceral injury and his examination is benign with a soft abdomen.
#5:  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 23195**] has no evidence of any infection and he is not on any antibiotics.
However, he was easily extubated after his wound was found to not have caused any injury to his major vessels or abdominal viscera.
He has an injury to his lung, which caused hemothorax, which has now resolved and he currently has two small wounds on his chest, secondary to his stabbing and his chest tube.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Left chest stabbing with left hemothorax.
