Abdominal pain of unknown origin.
Human immunodeficiency virus.
Renal insufficiency.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-    resistant enterococcus septicemia.
Human immunodeficiency virus disease.
Renal insufficiency.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 48-year-old male with HIV, a CD4 count of 600 in [**2111-10-19**], with a history of thrombocytopenia who complains of abdominal pain x 4 to 5 months which has worsened in the last several days.
He had previously been worked up at an outside hospital but felt unsatisfied with his treatment.
Also admits to fevers and chills and complains of a rash over his trunk and leg with positive pruritus, headaches, nose bleeds, and gingival bleeding that he has noticed.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for HIV disease x 14 years (for which he has stopped antiretroviral therapy), thrombocytopenia, hepatitis C, question cirrhosis.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes and CHF in his mother.
Appears in no acute distress.
HEENT with question of macroglossia.
Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Abdominal exam with generalized tenderness noted in the superior portion of the abdomen.
Dull to percussion, but no shifting dullness, and no masses appreciated.
Rectal exam is guaiac negative, as per the emergency department resident, no masses noted.
Extremities with 1 to 2+ pitting edema to the knee.
A vague and poor historian.
Skin with diffuse raised white papules, pruritic, without drainage noted on the back of his legs bilaterally.
UA showed some small blood and occasional bacteria.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  Ultrasound of his abdomen showed no ductal dilatation, mild gallbladder wall edema which probably relates to hepatitic disease as per radiology resident.
Chest x-ray showed low volumes with segmented atelectasis in the right middle lobe.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the floor, at which time he spiked a temperature to 104.1 in the first couple hours.
He was diagnosed as having had gram-positive cocci bacteremia.
The septicemia was identified as being staph aureus.
His stool had been negative for C. diff, he had a negative EGD; and a CT at that time had shown a large gallbladder, hardened wall, and a diffuse collection around the pancreas.
Retroperitoneal density and retroperitoneal adenopathy were also noted.
In light of the MRSA positive cultures his antibiotic coverage was expanded to include vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl.
The patient was transfused up to a hematocrit of 30, and an echo was ordered to assess for endocarditis.
The patient remained afebrile for hospital day 3 and hospital day 4.
On the night of [**2-17**] the patient became lethargic and was started on rifamycin for possible encephalopathy.
The patient underwent a bone scan on [**2112-2-18**] which showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
Over the following couple of days the patient remained afebrile, although he developed severe anasarca; and on [**2112-2-22**] he tried to pull out his PICC line, which had to be replaced.
Psychiatry saw the patient and determined that he was in delirium (mild) which was due to multifactorial's including AIDS, effects of opiates, resolving sepsis, and hepatic encephalopathy.
For this, the patient's urine was tested and turned up positive only for opiates which he had been receiving for analgesia while in the hospital.
On [**2112-2-26**] cultures came back from his PICC line that were positive not only for MRSA but also VRE.
On [**2112-2-27**] the patient complained of increased fluid in his lower extremities, scrotum, and abdomen.
On the 12th, surgery was also consulted for possible lymph node biopsy to rule out lymphoma to explain his thrombocytopenia and his lower extremity edema.
At that time, surgery felt that any biopsy would carry with it a significant risk of complications.
Interventional radiology attempted a lymph node aspiration which showed MRSA but was an inadequate sample to rule out lymphoma.
UA was sent which was positive for yeast.
On [**3-3**], surgery was re-consulted for possible cellulitis in the lower extremity.
At that time, surgery felt that he needed emergent I and D with possible hip disarticulation.
His right lower extremity had developed 3+ pitting edema and erythema.
On the afternoon of [**2112-3-4**] the patient was taken back to the OR for more debridement of the right lower extremity with a diagnosis now of necrotizing fasciitis of the right leg and scrotum.
The patient remained critically ill in the SICU over the remainder of [**3-4**] and [**3-5**] but without apparent expansion of the fasciitis.
On the remainder of the 20th there was noted to be no further bleeding from his wounds.
On [**3-7**] the results of previous blood cultures came back positive for Enterobacter which was consistent with the urine culture earlier as well as a candidal positive culture from a swab taken in the OR from the right thigh.
The patient was then noted to have poly organism infection, as well as thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy which were multifactorial.
Necrotic tissue was noted on the right lower extremity, and it was debrided at the bedside on both [**3-9**] and [**2112-3-10**]; debridement of necrotic muscle.
Still necrotic tissue formed and patient had to be debrided again, with each debridement raising the problems of more bleeding in this severely thrombocytopenic patient.
On [**3-14**], the patient's renal and hepatic failure continued to worsen as well as progressive necrosis noted in his lower extremity, and the team decided to discuss with the family the futility of ongoing aggressive measures in this patient and ongoing care which in their opinion would futile.
During this time, on the morning of [**3-15**], the patient became hemodynamically unstable again.
His ABG showed increasing metabolic acidosis.
