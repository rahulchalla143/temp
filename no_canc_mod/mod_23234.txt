Admission Date:  [**2128-9-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-10-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-12-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**] Chief Complaint: Lightheadedness, disorientation -> Acute on chronic subdural hematoma; atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 75 yo male w/ paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p left frontal craniotomy and evacuation on [**9-22**] for an acute on chronic left frontal subdural hematoma who presents with lightheadedness and disorientation yesterday, [**9-29**].
On day of admission, [**9-29**], patient was in the shower when he suddenly felt lightheaded, near syncopal with associated leg heaviness.
He denies palpitations, chest pain or shortness of breath at that time and did not lose consciousness.
The patient had no post-ictal symptoms of language difficulties, bowel/bladder incontinence, tongue biting, changes in vision, diaphoresis, pain.
CT head without contrast showed no change from previous images.
Neurosurgery was consulted on the patient and did not feel there were any neurosurgical concerns.
The patient found in Atrial Fibrillation with RVR (HR 160s with relative hypotension) and complained of chest pain.
Troponin was 0.02 x 2 but with normal MB/MBI, and elevated CK 745.
Upon arrival to the floor (CC7), patient complained of [**10-16**] in his right wrist consistent with previous gout flares.
He has previously been admitted to an outside hospital for pain control due to his refractory gout.
ROS:  Patient denies fevers/chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea/vomiting, cough, abdominal pain, dysuria, melena, BRBPR, rash, sick contacts or recent travel.
Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation (2+ year) 2.
Aortic valve replacement (bioprosthetic) for aortic stenosis Per ECHO [**2127-1-26**], aortic area 14 cm2, EF50-55%, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, small-moderate pericardial effusion 3.
Hypertension/hyperlipidemia 9.
Adematous colon polyps 10.
Degenerative joint/disk disease 13.
Obstructive sleep apnea   Social History: Lives in [**Location 13011**] with wife.
Family History: Gout, both parents deceased from stroke and had diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease in father.
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm at time of exam, nl S1/2, no murmurs Lungs: CTA b/l, no w/r/r Extrem: Warm and well-perfused.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
No rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
?RUSB systolic click with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur.
No wheezing/rhonchi/rales, mild bibasilar crackles ABDOMEN: +BS.
Soft, non-tender/non-distended, overweight EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis/ecchymosis.
Mild bilateral lower extremity edema.
2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
Imaging: CT (Outside hospital [**9-29**] @ 1400): Interval drainage of left subdural hematoma.
Small residual chronic left subdural hematoma.
Small band of higher density material within this chronic subdural may reflect residual change after craniotomy, although a small acute bleed can not be excluded.
Little change of the acute on chronic left subdural hematoma from five hours prior.
Focal left frontal cortical hyperdensity (2:17) may be due to partial volume averaging or hemorrhage.
Postoperative changes with decreased pnumocephalus from [**2128-9-23**].
Previously noted artificial aortic valve is not well appreciated on the current study.
No focal consolidation is seen.
There is prominence of the left hilum of uncertain clinical significance.
Multiple possible old right-sided rib deformities/fractures are again noted.
EKG ([**Hospital1 18**] [**9-29**] in ED): Atrial fibrillation, HR 105, RBBB, <1mm ST depressions in lead I .
MRI ([**2128-10-1**]): No evidence of acute infarct identified.
Left-sided frontoparietal subdural again identified with signal characteristics indicative of acute on subacute subdural collection, and overall, the size is unchanged from the CT of [**2128-9-29**].
Small amount of subarachnoid blood is identified at the left frontoparietal convexity region along the sulci, better appreciated on the current study.
Mild pachymeningeal enhancement is identified which appears postoperative.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo male with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (rhythm but not rate controlled), acute on chronic subdural hematoma, aortic valve replacement who was called out of the MICU on POD 8 s/p craniotomy and evacuation, for transient altered mental status (?seizure) and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
No focal neurological deficits are observed on CC7, except for patient's post-op slowing of speech and word finding difficulties.
Differential diagnosis included hypovolemia vs. cardiac ischemia vs. seizures vs. stroke.
Neurology was consulted, who did not feel patient had had seizures given the lack of post-ictal symptoms.
MRI as recommended by Neurology showed no ischemic changes.
Patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and came back negative X3, ruling out myocardial infarction.
Atrial fibrillation - Paroxysmal, likely triggered by poor PO intake prior to admission.
Patient has a porcine valve, so does not need anticoagulation and the risk of bleeding into his subdural was felt to be higher and more serious than the less than 1-2% risk of emboli from unanticoagulated atrial fibrillation.
Subdural Hematoma - Stable per neurosurgery and CT head on admission.
Acute Renal Failure - Likely prerenal due to poor PO fluids.
His acute renal failure resolved prior to transfer to the floor.
Gout - Patient was in significant pain upon arrival to the floor secondary to right wrist gout flare.
His right wrist was found to be erythematous, slightly edematous and very tender to palpation.
Patient was continued on his home colchicine and probenecid, and his pain managed with Dilaudid 0.5mg IV q4hrs PRN pain.
Patient's gout pain improved significantly by the second day of steroids, as did the erythema, edema and tenderness to palpation.
Sleep Consult was called and a sleep study performed in-house which confirmed patient's sleep apnea with obstructive as well as central components.
PPX: Patient was kept in pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.

You were found to be in atrial fibrillation, which likely contributed to your discomfort.
In the hospital, you developed a urinary tract infection which we are treating with antibiotics.
You also had an acute flare or your gout, which was managed with pain medications and prednisone.
--> STARTED you on Diltiazem 30mg four times daily, to control your atrial fibrillation --> STARTED you on Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily for 7 more days, to complete a 10 day course of antibiotics for your urinary tract infection --> STARTED Prednisone for your gout.
Also seek medical attention if you develop any new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or unusual stools.
