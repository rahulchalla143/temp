She has a hx of severe asthma and has been on prednisone for the last 6-7 years with inability to wean due to increased wheezing and SOB.

Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o F with hx of mild dHF, HTN, bicuspid AV, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin (INR 2.4 on admission), severe asthma (on standing prednisone) who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after presenting with syncope found to be in CHB and 9-sec pause on tele.
# SYNCOPE - likely due to arrhythmia septal disease in the area involving the bundle of His, potentially exacerbated by increased albuterol use (increased heart rate inducing prolonged pausing at AV node).
Post op we started Vancomycin and then switched to PO Clindamycing 450 q8 x 48 hours for prophylaxis.
------- CHRONIC ------- # HTN - pt normotensive during admission.
# AV Replacement: Mechanical AVR in [**2175**] for bicuspid AV, recent Echo ([**6-/2185**]) showed that valve with well seated with no evidence of dehiscence.
#  ASTHMA: Patient has severe asthma in setting of possible mold contamination in her home.
She has been on prednisone for last 6-7 years with inability to wean.
#  DM Type 2 vs Steroid Induced: Last A1C (7%, [**2185-7-28**]) not currently on any home DM medications.
