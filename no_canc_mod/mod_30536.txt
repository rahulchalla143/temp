HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 52 year old female with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, obesity and peripheral vascular disease on Coumadin who presents with bright red blood per rectum since about midnight on the day prior to admission.
The patient experienced periumbilical abdominal pain followed by watery non-bloody diarrhea all afternoon.
The patient was recently admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service from [**1-4**] until [**1-16**] with congestive heart failure and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and new onset of rapid atrial fibrillation where she was treated with a Diltiazem drip.
The patient had an elevated creatinine during that admission which was thought to be secondary to over diuresis, so her Lasix dose was decreased.
Since the day prior to admission, the patient denies any chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath, but does report some lightheadedness.
The patient also reports nausea and vomiting with two episodes of non-bloody emesis with food particles.
The patient does report having bloody stools greater than ten years ago when she was drinking heavily, but that had never been worked up.
She denies a colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the past.
The patient is still with some abdominal pain and bright red blood per rectum.
Congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in [**2169-12-13**], with one plus mitral regurgitation, two plus tricuspid regurgitation, normal wall motion and ejection fraction.
Diabetes mellitus.
Cerebrovascular accident with seizure disorder.
Morbid obesity.
Peripheral vascular disease status post left femoral to popliteal bypass in [**2164**].
Atonic bladder.
History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in her left knee.
History of atrial fibrillation in [**2169-12-13**].
Coronary artery disease status post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in [**2169-12-13**] with a cast at that time showing a 50% ostial lesion with no intervention done.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of between 1.2 and 1.5.
ALLERGIES:   The patient has no known drug allergies.
No alcohol, but has a past history of alcohol abuse.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Diabetes mellitus.
Periumbilical tenderness.
Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.009, small blood, moderate leukocyte esterase, two red blood cells, 35 white blood cells, many bacteria.
No ST changes.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 52 year old female on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, who presents with bright red blood per rectum.
She had had a flexible sigmoidoscopy upon admission on [**2170-1-26**], which showed signs that may have been consistent with early ischemic colitis.
Because of an elevation in her creatinine for an acute on chronic picture, a CT scan without contrast was done.
The CT scan at that time was a limited study given that there was no intravenous contrast.
There was one loop of distended small bowel without wall thickening and a loss of transverse colonic haustration, also without wall thickening, a nonspecific finding, and ischemia could not be excluded.
There was no free intraperitoneal air and no portal air.
There was an area of narrowing with wall thickening in the splenic flexure which may represent peristalsis but a constricting lesion also could not be excluded.
The patient's further gastrointestinal course was essentially that she was kept off Coumadin while she had been placed on a heparin drop for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
This was also discontinued in her setting of her continued drop in hematocrit.
She had a follow-up flexible sigmoidoscopy done which showed findings consistent with melanosis coli, but there were no clear reasons why she had suffered from bright red blood per rectum.
It was thought that when she was more stable and her acute medical issues were resolved and she was out of the Intensive Care Unit, that she would benefit from a full colonoscopy and/or a video study to further evaluate her gastrointestinal tract.
Of note, the patient also was noted to have an elevated alkaline phosphatase and LDH, and the etiology of this was not clear.
It was thought that she was likely suffering from an infiltrative process.
An ultrasound was done of the gallbladder which showed stable cholelithiasis but no evidence of cholecystitis.
It was thought that this may be a secondary infiltrative process from her acute illness in the Intensive Care Unit and no further interventions were done.
CARDIOLOGY:  The patient was status post recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with a catheterization and no intervention.
She had also been recently treated for atrial fibrillation and was on Coumadin.
During her hospitalization, the patient again developed atrial fibrillation and had been cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm.
During the setting of her acute illnesses, the patient again developed atrial fibrillation.
Her heparin drip was discontinued as she was having difficulties with a gastrointestinal bleed, so she remained without anti-coagulation as this was the reason she was hospitalized and with anti-coagulation, she continued to bleed.
The patient thus failed the initial cardioversion in the setting of another acute illness and was kept on amiodarone.
At the time of this dictation, she was in continued atrial fibrillation and was rate controlled on Amiodarone, Diltiazem and Lopressor.
PEA arrest:  The patient had two episodes of PEA arrest during her hospitalization.
There were no case studies showing any relation between receiving intravenous contrast and developing PEA arrest, however, it was also in the setting of the patient lying down flat.
The patient has a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea, so it is not unreasonable to presume that perhaps there was a hypoxic component to her PEA arrest.
initially she was in asystole and then PEA with a narrow complex bradycardia which was taken to be notable.
She had been extubated a few days after her initial PEA arrest only to suffer a second episode of PEA arrest and was re-intubated to protect her airway again.
The second PEA arrest was two minutes and she was resuscitated and had subsequent hypotension requiring transient pressors.
The patient at the time of this dictation, did not suffer any more episodes of PEA arrest.
PULMONARY:  The patient is a very obese woman and likely suffers from an obesity hypoventilation syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea.
She had been intubated twice in the setting of a PEA arrest.
After her second extubation, the patient had been stable until she again was noted to have respiratory distress and was re-intubated for this reason.
In order to treat the patient's obstructive sleep apnea, it is important that she sit relatively high with her head of bed elevated 45 degrees, so that the girth of her abdomen is not weighing upon her chest wall and subsequently causing more difficulties in her breathing status.
The patient is also someone who benefits from CPAP at night to keep her alveoli open in the setting of having a large chest wall.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient, at the time of her third intubation in the setting of respiratory distress, was found to have a metabolic acidosis and it was felt that she was in respiratory distress secondary to compensation from the underlying acidosis.
A full work-up was done to find the etiology of her sepsis, which had required pressors and she had a pan-CT of her body to look for any signs or symptoms of infection including pneumonia, abdominal abscess, colitis.
She had a lower extremity CT scan to see if she had any evidence of seeding infection to her knee where she had prior surgery; however, the CT scans were essentially negative and it was not clear exactly the source of her sepsis.
However, it was noted that the patient had increasing sputum so she was treated with a two week course of a treatment of Vancomycin for a ventilator acquired pneumonia.
After the patient was extubated for the third time, she also developed a VRE urinary tract infection and a Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis sepsis.
She had a few episodes of acute on chronic renal insufficiency which subsided with treatment of her underlying sepsis and her underlying fluid status.
The patient had no further complications and tolerated increasing levels of diuresis with Lasix.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had an anemia upon admission thought secondary to her blood loss from her bright red blood per rectum.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus and she was kept on an insulin drip for most of her hospital stay given that the goal fingersticks were between 80 and 120 in the acute care setting.
Of note, the patient had an elevated prolactin level and some galactorrhea.
NEUROLOGICAL/PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient had a history of depression but her anti-depressants were held in the setting of a change in mental status and lethargy.
The patient was also noted to have fair weakness while she was in the Intensive Care Unit.
Neurology was consulted and felt that she had a critical care myopathy and neuropathy, which should be resolved when treatment of her underlying medical condition was also treated.
Of note, the patient also had an elevated sedimentation rate and CRP and we were unclear if it was contributing to her weakness or her overall slow recovery after extubation.
Rheumatology was consulted and they felt it was unlikely to be a rheumatological process and suggested to keep the patient off steroids as the risks of steroids were greater than any benefit and to keep the patient off steroids empirically if no clear reasons for steroids was identified.
OPHTHALMOLOGY:  The patient was noted to have increasing erythema and edema around both of her eyes, but especially noted on the left.
She was seen by Ophthalmology who felt that she had an exposure keratopathy as well as a corneal abrasion and she was treated with Ciprofloxacin and Erythromycin Ointments to help prevent any further infection.
