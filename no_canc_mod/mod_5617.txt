She was in her USOH today until she went to the mall with her daughter and developed the acute onset of pressure-type central chest pain and nausea while walking.
She sat down w/out relief of her pain and the pain lasted for several hours w/out change until it slowly faded in our ED.
She took NTG in the mall w/out any relief of her pain and got NTG and ASA in the ED w/out relief either.
Her previous anginal equilivant has been pressure chest pain across her entire chest w/ associated SOB.
During this current episode, she denies SOB and further denies recent cough, HA, dysuria, abdominal pain, diarrhea, URI symptoms, diaphoresis, palpatations, or paresthesias.
She has had no history of trauma to the chest although she does not a L rib pain that started acutely after she lifted a bag and heard a snap.

No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Slightly prominent infundibulum along the medial aortic arch, apparently the origin of a small vessel, of doubtful clinical significance.
Mildly prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, and right hilar lymph nodes.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Central biliary ductal dilatation and pneumobilia.
Small low attenuations in the liver, too small to characterize.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Based on [**2120**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Blood cultures were drawn and the anaerobic bottle grew gram negative rods, which are consistent with possible anaerobic gut organisms.
The ERCP service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and felt that without symptoms and with a normal MRCP, that ERCP was not necessary.
2) Atrial fibrillation: She was noted to go into A fib two days into hospitalization, with rapid response to 150-180's and associated hypotension.
Her chest pain was felt to possibly be secondary to stable angina, or was possibly secondary to paroxysmal A fib.
Ranitidine HCl 75 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for indigestion.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.

If you have fevers, chills, chest pain, or other concerns, please return to the ED or contact your PCP.
