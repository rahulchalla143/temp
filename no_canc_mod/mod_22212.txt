Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
Mildly dilated descending aorta.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Trivial MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
