Left anterior fascicular block.
No colonic diverticulitis.
Fibroid uterus.
Enlarged pulmonary artery in keeping with pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying consolidation and atelectasis within the lower lobes bilaterally.
Multinodular goiter with bilateral thyroid nodules.
Skin thickening and irregularity along the right inguinal fold at site ofprevious I&D.
No evidence of abscess.
Fibroid uterus.
Moderate calcification of the common femoral, superficial femoral and profunda femoral arteries bilaterally.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring 15 mm.
Several filling defects were seen in the CBD consistent with stones.
If any abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call ERCP fellow on call ([**Pager number 8437**]) Further management of PTC drain as per IR.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo woman presenting from nursing facility with recent well-healing groin abcess, admitted with cholangitis, Klebsiella bacteremia, septic shock, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Hospital course was also notable for deep venous thrombosis.
#Cholangitis/Klebsiella bacteremia/Septic Shock/Choledocholithiasis: Patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit in septic shock requiring vasopressor support and found to have Klebsiella bacteremia.
LFTs were normal, but an abdominal ultrasound showed a dilated common bile duct.
Once the patient was hemodynamically stable a repeat ERCP was performed which was notable for choledocholithiasis and a sphincterotomy with stone extraction was performed and a biliary stent was placed.
#Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Obstructive Sleep Apnea: This was felt to be related to the patient's sepsis.
She was intubated and then extubated when sepsis improved.
Following treatment of her infection she was maintained on [**1-18**] L oxygen by nasal canula.
She has obstructive sleep apnea and was instructed to wear her BIPAP at night once discharged.
#Lower extremity Deep Venous Thrombosis/End stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis: Patient was found to have left lower extremity DVT in the same leg as her femoral hemodialysis line.
Given the patient's problems with access in the past, the decision after discussion with Nephrology was to keep the line in and continue anticoagulation.
On day of discharge there was pus noted from around the hemodialysis line.
Renal was made aware and cultures were taken but the Renal team did not want to start empiric antibiotics.
# Pruritis: Upon transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] prior to second ERCP, Ms. [**Known lastname **] began to note pruritis of her back.
There existed a maculopapular rash on the regions of her back which contact[**Name (NI) **] her sheets.
Her pruritis improved with discontinuation of bleached sheets, sarna lotion, and a short course of topical clobetasol.
#Diabetes mellitus type 2: continued home NPH and ISS  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient is having intermittent vaginal bleeding, she should be evaluated by GYN as an outpatient for possible endometrial biopsy - Patient's left tunneled line was noted to have mild possibly purulent discharge at dialysis on [**2139-12-29**].
There were however no other symptoms or signs of infection.

You were admitted with a severe bacterial infection because of an obstruction of your bile ducts(cholangitis).
You had a biliary drain(cholecystostomy)  placed by interventional radiology to drain infected bile, but the drain was removed after a few days when you had the ERCP procedure.
The following changes have been made to your medications: START Warfarin for the clot in your leg (duration to be determined by your primary care physician) START benadryl as needed for itching START nephrocaps for nutrition START sarna lotion as needed for itching START miconazole as needed for itching or skin-based yeast infections  Please make sure INR is checked on dialysis days for next two weeks to ensure that it is in therapeutic range.
