Electronically signed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4901**], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2134-2-24**] 14:   Brief Hospital Course: On [**2-22**] went to operating room for minimally invasive valve repair.
After lines were placed he received heparin bolus and was found to have hematoma at line site in right neck.
He was also noted to have hematuria that was treated with irrigation and resolved.
He underwent CTA of neck that showed no bleeding or fistulas.
On [**2-23**] his neck was ecchymotic but soft.
He was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated without complications.
After discussion with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], he decided to have a conventional mitral valve repair.
He continued to progress, his narcotics were discontinued due to confusion.
