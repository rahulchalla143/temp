Admission Date:  [**2193-7-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-7-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2142-11-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**] Chief Complaint: multiple stab wounds  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2193-7-9**]- 1.
Bilateral thigh exploration.
Left arm exploration.
He was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER and coded for enroute for PEA twice and was intubated.
In the ER, b/l chest tubes were placed and agressive resuscitation was initiated for acedemia nd hypovolemia.
Past Medical History: Remote dysthymia (tx with fluoxetine then paroxetine [**2183**]-[**2185**]), lupus (x7 years in remission, baseline Cr = 1.3), hypertension (goal BP < 125/75), GERD, asthma  Social History: Lives with wife and 2 children, no tobacco, EtOH, or illicits   Family History: None  Physical Exam: Exam on Admission:  General: Intubated, sedated HEENT: Right sided neck laceration 8 cm, central laceration with arterial bleed, 10 cm left neck laceration through the muscle without active bleed C. collar on Chest: Decreased breath sounds, bilateral chest lacerations Cardiovascular: Regular Rate and Rhythm, Normal S1, S2 Abdominal: Soft, Nontender Extr/Back: Bilateral AC lacerations with active bleeding, R radial laceration, B groin lacerations that are bleeding slowly, B posterior Knee lacerations - not bleeding   Pertinent Results: EEG [**2107-7-13**]: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
It showed a low voltage slow background throughout.
This suggests a moderately severe encephalopathy, and it did not change appreciably over the course of the recording.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Air-fluid levels in the sphenoid and maxillary sinuses and blood in the nasal cavity and pharynx.
Right subgaleal hematoma and increased soft tissue density over the right lateral cheek.
Multiple regions of soft tissue injury with packing in the lower left anterior chest.
No obvious contusion or in the left lung, deep to the skin defect.
One of the right chest tubes takes an acute angulation with the tip possibly in the major fissure or may also lung parenchyma.
Diffuse consolidation in the right upper lobe and dependent aspect of right lower lobe and to a lesser extend, the dependent portion of the left lower lobe.
It is uncertain if the consolidation represents hemorrhage, contusion, or aspiration (or a combination).
There are nonspecific ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe and scattered nodular opacities.
Small residual nondependent anterior pneumothorax on the right with adjacent subcutaneous air.
Limited noncontrast scan of the abdomen with small free fluid locules around the liver, spleen, and deep within the pelvis.
Slightly elevated attenuation of the fluid may indicate a hemorrhagic component, however, exact attenuation is inaccurate due to the streak artifact.
Bilateral nondisplaced anterior rib fractures in the right third, fifth, and sixth ribs and the left fourth and fifth ribs, presumably from resuscitation.
Fluid within the right inguinal canal or high location of the right testis.
His injuries included: Lacerations to b/l popliteal fossae, Lacerations to b/l AC fossae, Lacerations to zone 2 bilateral neck, Lac b/l medial thigh, Lacerations to ventral wrists b/l Stab wounds L anterior chest, Lac to L flank, and rib fx: R 3,5,6 L 4,5.
His course is summarized by systems below:  N: He was sedated with fent/versed initially.
He had seizure activity overnight on HD 2; an EEG on HD 3 showed no seizure activity but did show clonic jerks.
A head MRI was obtained as he was localizing pain but not responding to commands; it demonstrated only a tiny frontal lobe infarct.
CV: He initially had a multiple pressor requirement and large volume blood loss.
As he was resuscitated the pressor requirement was slowly weaned down but did not completely resolve.
He continued to require neosynephrine during persistent episodes of upper GI bleeding, and this requirement increased significantly [**7-20**] prior to withdrawal of care.
For his rib fractures and pneumothorax two chest tubes were placed.
On HD 6 they were transitioned to water seal and a post waterseal film revealed no PTX.
GI: On HD 4 he began to have bloody output from the OGT.
GI was consulted and performed UGI at bedside on HD 5; this demonstrated diffuse ulcers with clot but no active bleed.
He underwent two additional EGDs on [**7-15**] and [**7-19**] without a localization of a specific bleeding source.
Discussion regarding possible interventional radiology embolization or surgical treatment including gastrectomy were discussed at length with the patient's wife, and the decision not to pursue further invasive treatment was made on [**7-19**].
He continued to have bloody output from the NG tube and continued on a PPI gtt until withdrawal of care.
GU: He had an acute kidney injury on admission, thought likely [**12-20**] prolonged ischemia during prehospital course.
This was continued until [**7-18**], when he was dosed with DDAVP in hope of controlling his upper GI bleeding by improving platelet function.
ID: He was found to have GNR's in his blood which speciated to pseudomonas.
He also had GNR's in his sputum which speciated to Enterobacter as well as Pseudomonas.
