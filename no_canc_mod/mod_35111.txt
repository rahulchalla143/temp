He developed recurrent angina ans was admitted for catheterization.

FINDINGS: There is evidence of atherosclerotic plaque formation, which is partially calcified.
However, this does not result in a significant ICA stenosis on either side.
No significant ICA stenosis on either side.
The patient reports that he has had stable exertional angina but that over the past month he has noticed an escalation in his symptoms.
He describes shortness of breath and mid chest pressure after carrying bundles approximately 100 feet, resolving with relaxation.
He had no anginal symptoms but did have inferolateral ST depression.
Imaging revealed a dilated LV cavity with stress.
A large reversible lateral and apical wall defect was noted.
Mr [**Known lastname 61836**] was evaluated for Coronary artery bypass graft and was taken to the OR on [**3-16**] once he completed his plavix washout and his creatinine which had elevated after his cath dye load had returned to baseline.
Given his history of sleep apnea Bipap was used overnight while in hospital.
