* [**2140-6-15**] CTA CHEST Bibasilar atelectasis without evidence for pulmonary embolus.
The area of vascularity is again seen in the left anterior fundus myometrium.
There is likely a small retained product of conception less than 5 mm in size.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 65617**] was admitted with postpartum hemorrhage secondary to postpartum hemorrhage requiring US guided dilation and curettage and bilateral uterine artery embolization.
* On post-op day #2, the patient experienced persistent chest pain, radiating to her back, worsened with inspiration.
The patient underwent CTA that ruled out pulmonary embolus.
Following this, her pain eventually resolved.
She was seen by Social Work who felt that patient could adequately cope with this experience and showed no signs of depression.
* On post-op day #4, the patient's antibiotics were discontinued and she had a pelvic ultrasound that showed improved appearance of her uterus and possibly a small 5mm POC.
Given that her bleeding was stable it was decided to allow that small area to resolve on its own.
She remained afebrile, not requiring any pain medications, tolerating her diet, breastfeeding and ambulating without difficulty.
