Admission Date:  [**2135-7-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2135-7-15**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old woman with coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, and recent cardiac catheterization, who had been experiencing increasing shortness of breath at rest.
Patient woke up the morning of her admission with shortness of breath.
Denied any chest pains, nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.
Patient states lower extremity edema comes and goes, and the shortness of breath has occasionally been associated with cough.
She denies any fever or chills.
Patient prior myocardial infarction in [**2135-3-1**] presented as "indigestion-type symptoms without chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or shortness of breath."
She was given Plavix on discharge, but patient discontinued Plavix after developing a severe rash within one month's time.
The patient went to outside hospital, [**Hospital1 **] for shortness of breath and presented with a blood pressure of 167/87, sating at 97% on 4 liters.
Her cardiac catheterization was delayed secondary to an elevated creatinine levels at 1.9.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 **], the patient states that her shortness of breath had gotten better after administration of Lasix from the outside hospital.
Cardiac catheterization status post inferior myocardial infarction in [**2135-3-1**].
Cardiac catheterization showed a 90% stenosis of the RCA, mild disease of the LAD, no disease of the left circumflex.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Right knee replacement.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Has remote history of smoking.
General examination:  In no acute distress.
HEENT:  The patient has elevated jugular venous distention to the angle of the jaw.
Lung examination:  The patient has crackles on both bases of lung fields.
Abdominal examination:  Nontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No cyanosis evident.
The patient has +1 nonpitting edema of both legs.
CHEST X-RAY:  Right pleural effusion consistent with congestive heart failure.
Patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction for peak troponins of 0.77.
Patient received an echocardiogram, which showed inferior hypokinesis and anterior akinesis.
Echocardiogram also showed a decreased ejection fraction of 30-35%.
Left main coronary artery showed no disease, left anterior descending showed 50% disease, a high diagonal ......... to LAD showed a 60-70% stenosis, left circumflex showed no disease, right coronary artery showed 80% irregular ulcerated in-stent restenosis.
Cardiac catheterization showed a right dominant system.
Subsequently, the patient complained of increasing shortness of breath.
Patient also became tachypneic with a respiratory rate into the 40s.
Chest x-ray was performed, which showed lung examination consistent with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema.
Patient was on Heparin drip for prophylaxis of thrombus formation secondary to anterior akinesis visualized on echocardiogram.
In CCU the patient was started on Augmentin for presumed urinary tract infection secondary to leukocytosis of 17.
Patient's creatinine levels continued to be elevated at 1.9.
Creatinine continued to be elevated into 2.2, at which point patient's ACE inhibitor was discontinued and creatinine levels were monitored.
Also while on the floor, the patient was followed by the Advance Congestive Heart Failure Service.
She was continued on gentle diuresis until her discharge.
Patient developed a leukocytosis at 12.5.
Urine cultures were sent and urinalysis suggested a urinary tract infection.
The patient was getting empirically treated with Augmentin for presumed urinary tract infection.
She left with no shortness of breath and no chest pain.
No chest pain, no shortness of breath.
Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%.
Urinary tract infection.
Anemia with a hematocrit into the low 30s.
She is also a possible candidate for Epogen as she has a chronic anemia.
She was also encouraged to see her primary care physician regarding [**Name Initial (PRE) **] granulocytosis secondary to Ticlid side-effects.
