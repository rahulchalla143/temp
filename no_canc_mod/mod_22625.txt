Mild wall thickening of the gallbladder, most likely secondary to the hypoalbuminea from the patient's cirrhosis, with a small amount of sludge.
Arterio-biliary fistula in segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] with active extravasation of iv contrast into the bile ducts and excretion into the duodenum.
The stomach and duodenum are filled with blood clots suggesting additional hemorrhage from a more proximal site (esophageal varices) 3.
Increased density of perihepatic ascites likely due to contrast from prior TIPS procedure.
Nodular liver, ascites and varices consistent with cirrhosis.
[**6-15**] EGD: Impression: - Esophageal varices - Grade B esophagitis (injection) - Blood in the stomach - Duodenal ulcer (injection) - Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: Esophageal varices noted, esophagitis, and duodenal bulb ulcer.
Severe fresh bleeding from varices.
Contact[**Name (NI) **] surgery, IR for urgent repeat TIPS attempt, and embolization if concern for distal arterial bleed.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Small amount of ascites and left pleural effusion.
Splenomegaly and heterogeneous liver consistent with patient's known cirrhosis.
[**6-22**] EGD: Impression: - Ulcerations noted in the mid and distal esophagus, no active bleeding.
in the esophagus - Mosaic appearance in the stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy - Scope reached proximal jejunum, blood throughout, no active bleeding, suspect bleeding source distal to proximal jejunum.
- Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: - Please avoid NG suction - Please add on Carafate, continue PPI - Please f/u Hct closely and tranfusion as needed - Proceed with Angio to localize the bleeding source.
No contrast in the duodenum excluding arterial biliary fistula.
No evidence of GI bleed.
Heterogenoous area of hypoattenuation in the right lobe of the liver likely represents resolving infarction; however, an infection cannot be completely excluded.
Ascites and multiple varices noted.
Bilateral pleural effusions are increased compared to [**2118-6-15**] with adjacent associated compressive atelectasis versus pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
Air in the bladder likely secondary to instrumentation.
No specific CT evidence to suggest active GI bleeding.
Right pleural effusion.
Gallbladder wall thickening most likely reflect third spacing/chronic hepatic disease.
DISCHARGE LABS: ***  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 49M EtOH, HCV cirrhosis c/b varices transferred to ICU with massive UGIB from esophageal varices vs duodenal ulcer, stabilized s/p TIPS.
Hospital course c/b respiratory failure, peritonitis (rare strep viridans), worsening liver function, and persistent encephalopathy.
# UGIB: Per EGD at [**Hospital1 8**], multiple non-bleeding esophageal and gastric varices.
The site of active bleeding appeared to be in the 3rd or 4th portion of the duodenum, beyond the reach of the endoscope, however he did undergo banding of 5 varices at [**Hospital1 8**].
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] it was thought that he was likely bleeding from his varices, and initially another endoscopy was deferred given his recent banding.
The morning of hospital day #2 he underwent another EGD which showed bleeding varices and bleeding from a duodenal ulcer.
Over the next few days the [**Last Name (un) **] balloons were taken down, and he did not have any further bleeding.
The patient resumed bleeding and had frank blood draining from his rectal tube.
The patient also had coagulopathy [**3-8**] to cirrhosis, requiring multiple units of platelets and FFP.
# ETOH abuse: Pt endorsing symptoms of withdrawl at the time of admission.
# Hypocalcemia: due to multiple blood transfusions, his ionized calcium was checked with every hematocrit check and aggressively repleted.
After he no longer required frequent transfusions his calcium remained stable.
# Hepatitis C: Reportedly Ab positive in '[**14**] and never treated.
Likely contributing to cirrhosis, hepatitis C antibiody was positive, viral load 170K.
With his liver disease after his bleeding had stabilized he was restarted on lactulose and rifaximin due to concern that encephalopathy could be contributing to his decreased mental status.
He then had increased difficulty oxygenating as his volume status worsened (+30L LOS).
CTA had e/o bilateral pleural effusions, compression atelectasis vs PNA.
Through goals of care discussions with the family, the decision was made not to re-intubate the patient if his respiratory status were to worsen.
This was discontinued on [**7-6**], however the patient on [**7-9**] pulled out his dobhoff tube and desaturated to 88%, and was re-started on vancomycin/zosyn for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Hypotension: Pt became hypotensive on [**7-3**] - ?
had elevated WBC count with 6 bands, cannot r/o ongoing VAP in CXR.
No e/o SBP on diag para.
# GUB: The patient had a GU bleed [**3-8**] to traumatic Foley placement, requiring 6units pRBCs.
transfusion reaction vs drug reaction vs infectious.
He was also started on Cipro for SBP PPx.
# Cirrhosis: EtOH/HepC cirrhosis.
Peritoneal fluid Cx with rare Strep viridans.
Then continued on Cipro for SBP PPx.
He was given Rifaximin and Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy with good effect.
# Altered mental status: Likely [**3-8**] to hepatic encephalopathy - without significant improvement with Lactulose and Rifaximin.
CT head was negative for intracranial process.
# Disposition: ICU  MICU Course- [**Date range (1) 85157**]  Patient readmitted to MICU after developing another bleed while on the floor.
EGD showed severe gastritis and gastropathy.
He was also found to have colonopathy.
Patient will no longer receive blood products.
