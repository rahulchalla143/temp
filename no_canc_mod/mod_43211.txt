Head CT revealed no evidence of acute infarction; however, clinical indication with MRI was recommended.
-Brain MRI with MRA revealed acute infarction in the left anterior cerebral artery territory with a small discontinuous focus of infarction in the left posterior body at all lobes with associated blood products indicating focal hemorrhagic transformation.
Motion limited head MRA with probable atherosclerosis involving the right middle cerebral artery distal branches.
Neck MRA was a motion limited study with questionable filling defects in the proximal right and left internal carotid arteries.
Evolving left ACA distribution stroke with posterior area of hemorrhage and possible new area of ischemia involving the left MCA distribution.
No intracranial thrombus visualized on the head CT angiogram.
Severe stenosis of the bilateral extracranial internal carotid arteries, with measurements given above.
Please note that these measurements of degree of stenosis are not determined with accuracy due to the diameter being under the limits of precision reached by CT, and the diameter of the patent lumen may be overestimated.
There is extensive calcification of the thoracic aorta.
Lungs are clear with no evidence of focal consolidation to suggest acute pneumonia.
No pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute pneumonia.
TTE The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with extensive regional wall motion abnormalities as outlined on the chart (LVEF = 25%).
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate aortic stenosis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Allowing for lordotic positioning, no pneumothorax is detected.
There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.
No gross effusion is identified.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette may also be slightly improved.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1728**] is a 72 yo RH woman with history of CHF (EF 30%), afib on Coumadin, ESRD on HD (now daily), DM II, HL, HTN, COPD who initially presented to BIDN where she was found to have a L ACA infarct and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of b/l carotid stenoses (s/p L ICA stent) for CEA vs. angioplasty.
# NEURO: Ms. [**Known lastname 1728**] had L ACA infarct on presentation to BIDN.
On admission exam, pt had R sided facial droop and mild ptosis, R leg was paretic, RUE with 3+ delts and 4+ biceps/triceps.
She also has poor collateral circulation on vessel imaging which further increases her risk.
Given severe stenosis on the right side and total on left along with prior stent, risk of embolism and devastating stroke intra-op is high.
Pt is poor surgical candidate given imaging findings and multiple comorbidities.
Also, in BIDN, coumadin ws initially held in the setting of small hemorrage on CT.  Re-started warfarin here as pt is high risk for embolic stroke in setting of afib.
Given large territory ACA stroke, pt at risk for bleeding into the stroke bed.
The goal for her blood pressure neeeds to be systolically 120-160 given her high degree of carotid artery stenosis.
On [**8-19**], pt had rhythmic jerks of left arm and was non responsive.
Thought to be secondary to epileptiform activity.
# Cardio: -Chronic systolic congestive heart failure with LVEF 30%.
While at [**Hospital1 **], patient was found to have acute on chronic systolic CHF requiring daily dialysis.
- CAD s/p multiple stents last in [**4-/2204**]: NSTEMI and Unstable Angina.
While at [**Hospital1 **], patient was noted to have elevated troponin in the setting of chest discomfort.
It was thought that she had an NSTMI, but heparin was not administered because of the finding of focal intraparenchymal hemorrhage associated with her ischemic stroke.
While in [**Hospital1 18**], patient had a couple episode of atypical chest pain at rest (right upper back, similar to prior CAD per patient) which may be her unstable angina, serial EKGs were stable in nature.
She was thought not to be a candidate for intervention given recent ischemic stroke and high risk of bleed.
Also with large territory NSTEMI involving lateral and inferior leads, trop continued to trend up from 1.23 to 1.4.
(Does have CAD s/p multiple stents last in 4/[**2204**].)
She also required 2 pressors (phenylephrine and norepinephrine) - hypotension in setting of propofol and CVVH.
- Paroxysmal AF.
It was re-initiated at [**Hospital1 **] on a daily basis given the severity of her acute on chronic systolic heart failure.
# ID: E. coli UTI was found while she was at [**Hospital1 **].
It grew pan-sensitive E-coli.
Patient continued CTX to [**2204-8-18**], a longer course than intended 7 days as she had transient leukocytosis of unclear source while cultures were pending.
CTX was discontinued on [**8-18**] when repeat urine culture returned to have mixed flora and when her leukocytosis resolved.
Chest x-ray with focal consolidation during ICU stay, suspicious VAP.
Patient was afebrile thus primary ICU team did not feel that treatment with antibiotics was warranted at the time  # Supratherapeutic INR.
She had an NSTEMI, was volume overloaded thus difficult to ventilate but could not diurese as pressures did not tolerate even minimal volume shifts with CVVH.
Nitroglycerin SL 0.4 mg SL PRN chest pain 13.
