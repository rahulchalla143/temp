She reports this pain has been ongoing and intermittent for months, and has been occuring every night for the past few weeks.
She notes this pain only occurs at night and begins after she lays flat to sleep.
She has tried antacids, maalox, and omeprazole with no relief.
She has also tried nitroglycerin which will relieve her pain for about 1/2-1 hour, but then the pain returns.
She also has associated dyspnea along with the pain that is much improved with oxygen and sitting in an upright position.
Of note, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] last in [**6-4**] w/ pulmonary edema and dyspnea, had a tunneled IJ line placed and was initiated on dialysis in the setting of her renal transplant failure and volume overload.
She was intubated for respiratory distress and had good relief with lasix gtt with return of adequate oxygen saturations on room air.
She was evaluated by PCP for this chest pain most recently 5 days ago.
He noted that she hasn't had any weight changes nor increase swelling in her BLEs.
He believes chest pain is GI in origin patient is scheduled for outpatient endoscopy for further evaluation this Thursday along with treatment with omeprazole.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

MICROBIOLOGY [**2204-9-10**] MRSA SCREEN: No MRSA isolated .
IMAGING [**2204-9-10**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There is bilateral diffuse reticulonodular opacity in the lower lung fields and ground-glass haziness.
These findings are compatible with pulmonary edema.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
No definite pleural effusions are seen.
[**2204-9-11**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis and near akinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior walls.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2204-6-4**], the severity of mitral regurgitation is increased and global left ventricular systolic function is improved with slight decrease in cavity size.
[**2204-9-11**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): In comparison with the study of [**9-10**], there has been substantial decrease in the pulmonary [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] congestion with the pulmonary vessels now only mildly engorged.
Minimal atelectatic change is seen at the left base and there may be blunting of the costophrenic angle.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo F w/ CAD s/p MI (in [**2-3**]) and previous 2 stents in RCA and LAD, scleroderma, HTN, ESRD on HD s/p transplant x2, and systolic HF (EF 20-25%) who comes in with chronic burning chest pain and acute systolic heart failure.
# Acute Systolic CHF: Patient presented with increased dyspnea and chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.
Patient reports increased dyspnea prior to dialysis recently and may need change to dry weight.
Chest Pain/Burning: Pts pain was atypical.
Her symptom has bothered her each evening for a very long time, and is exacerbated when she lies on her back.
EKG was without changes, and discomfort resolved on arrival and with subsequent nitroglycerin.
ESRD sp transplant on HD: Pt had a session of ultrafiltration on the night of admission and was continued on her outpatient schedule of dialysis, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
# RHYTHM:  Pt was in sinus rhythm, and had no active issues with her rhythm during the admission.
Her lisinopril should be held on hemodialysis days due to low blood pressures.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES # Recommend initiating lisinopril 2.5mg daily as an outpatient as long as her blood pressures can tolerate it.
3. nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual as directed as needed for chest pain.
4. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Maalox Max Quick Dissolve 1,000-60 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) tab PO three times a day as needed for heartburn.
Aranesp (polysorbate)  Injection   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Family & [**Hospital1 1926**] Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure Ends stage renal disease Coronary artery disease Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had some chest discomfort that brought you into the hospital.
We think that some of this discomfort is because of your stomach and have started you on a new medicine and scheduled an appt with a gastroenterologist on Tuesday [**9-18**].
At the same time, you had too much fluid in your lungs and we removed a little more fluid with dialysis and adjusted your dialysis medications.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] or [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] NP[**MD Number(3) 37741**] have chest pain/burning at home that is worse than the mild chest burning you have experienced for the last few months.
You may take Calcium carbonate for this burning, sit up straight in a chair and avoid spicy or acidic foods.
