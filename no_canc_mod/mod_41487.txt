Admission Date:  [**2197-6-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-6-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-11-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint:  L sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1005**] is a 74 yo right-handed Spanish speaking man with h/o CAD, HTN, DM2, TIA who presents with sudden onset L sided weakness.
He could not move his left arm or leg at all, and had a left facial droop.
He was able to speak using correct words and short sentences with slight slurring, and was saying not to call an ambulance.
He was noted to have dense L hemiparesis, with only slight movement of the L ankle on command.
He had L facial droop.
He initially had some difficulty answering questions, and there was question of whether his speech was fluctuating.
NCHCT showed slight R MCA hyperdensity but otherwise no early signs of infarct.
The patient was reported to have gotten somewhat worse after tPA though it is not clear in what respect (possibly alertness or interaction).
The patient also received labetalol 10 mg IV x 2, which resulted in some bradycardia to the 40s.
He continued to have dense L hemiplegia with cortical signs including substantial neglect.
NCHCT showed hypodensity beginning to develop in the R subcortical structures (internal capsule and BG), but no hemorrhage.
CTA was done to evaluate for reconstitution of the R MCA after IV tPA, however this showed large clot in the R ICA distal to the bifurcation and absence of the R MCA, with collaterals providing some flow distally, as well as clot within the R A1 segment.
Both HTN and DM have been very refractory to medications, and he is compliant.
Past Medical History: -HTN, labile/difficult to control -DM2, on insulin for >20 years, complications include CKD -CAD -TIA, 1 year ago, presented with slurred speech and vision problems, resolved in [**1-30**] hours without treatment -atrial fibrillation, on coumadin -herniated disc  Social History: lives with wife and daughter, no tobacco, EtOH or illicits.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally Cardiac: RRR, no M/R/G Abdomen: soft, NT/ND Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Naming intact for high and low frequency objects.
There were no paraphasic errors.
Mild dysarthria.
There was severe neglect of the left side.
Patient not aware of his deficit, or of his left side.
Decreased tone on left side.
No adventitious movements.
Extinction and Neglect: 2  Pertinent Results: [**2197-6-27**] 03:25PM   WBC-20.4* RBC-5.17 HGB-14.8 HCT-47.4 MCV-92 MCH-28.6 MCHC-31.1 RDW-13.9 [**2197-6-27**] 03:25PM   PT-12.2 PTT-35.2 INR(PT)-1.1 [**2197-6-27**] 03:40PM   GLUCOSE-194* NA+-142 K+-5.4* CL--100 TCO2-27 [**2197-6-27**] 07:44PM   CK-MB-5 cTropnT-0.30*  CTA [**2197-6-27**] Acute right MCA infarction with complete right ICA occlusion from the carotid bifurcation to the right MCA.
No hemorrhage.
7 mg intra-arterial TPA was given within the clot in the distal internal carotid artery on the right.
No complications during the procedure.
NCHCT POST PROCEDURE [**2197-6-27**] Interval appearance of hyperdensities within predominantly on the right cerebral convexity sulci, including the right sylvian fissure, interpeduncular cistern, layering along the right tentorium and in the right parenchymal frontal [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] represent extravasation of contrast following recent interventional procedure, including unsuccessful thrombectomy.
However, intracranial, predominantly extra-axial hemorrhage is a serious consideration, particularly given the clinical context, including thrombolytic therapy.
A focus of pneumocephalus is noted along the expected course of the right MCA in the right frontal [**First Name3 (LF) 3630**], likely relates to recent procedure.
NCHCT [**2197-6-28**]  IMPRESSION:  Extensive hemorrhagic transformation of the acute right MCA territorial infarction, with new right basal ganglionic, intraventricular, and subdural hemorrhage.
New subfalcine herniation and at least leftward shift, and early downward transtentorial and likely cerebellar tonsillar herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: Major right hemispheric syndrome likely due to ischemia of the entire MCA territory with complete ICA occlusion on CTA.
Condition discussed at length with family, including granddaughter, sons and wife and explained that he has had a debilitating stroke with a significant risk of mortality.
On the other hand, has renal failure and at risk of permanent kidney damage from dye use with any catheter based interventions, which may or may not be successful.
Angio showed R-ICA occlusion distal to the bifurcation along with M1 occlusion.
The post-procedure head CT showed hemorrhagic conversion.
Within a few hours, he had further deterioration in his examination and repeat scan showed extensive hemorrhagic conversion in stroke territory.
This was felt to be incompatible with any meaningful neurologic recovery.
