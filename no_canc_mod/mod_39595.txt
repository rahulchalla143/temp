Admission Date:  [**2179-12-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-1-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-11-17**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5868**] Chief Complaint: Left sided weakness, blurry vision, facial droop  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IV t-PA angiography by interventional neurosurgery CT angio and multiple NCHCTs  History of Present Illness: ** History obtained from chart, co-residents, patient and patient's wife  **  Patient is a 55 year old right handed male with past medical history of alcohol abuse, PTSD, anxiety, ADHD who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2179-12-31**] for acute stroke.
Patient reports that he fell backwards and hit his head on ice while shoveling snow in the afternoon of new years eve.
He then was watching TV just before 20:00 when he had acute onset of blurred vision after coughing.
By time EMS arrived around 20:30, he was noted to have right gaze preference, dense left hemiplegia and left neglect.
Initial NIHSS 19.
Patient with right gaze preference, left visual neglect, left UMN facial palsy, left hemiplegia with no withdrawal to noxious stimuli, mild dysarthria and left neglect.
However, as of 22:15, symptoms worsened with decreased movement of left side to point of hemiplegia and more pronounced neglect.
Final interpretation of CTA suggestive of right ICA occlusion.
Then, on [**2179-1-2**], head CT showed a stroke on the right, less than one-half of the hemisphere, thus it was decided to start him on low dose heparin gtt and coumadin with a goal PTT 40-50.
Prior to angiograph, TTE was done and showed no PFO and no shunt.
Depression 5.
Asplenia secondary to trauma incurred during Vietman 10.
Multiple sharpnel injuries while in Vietmam, [**2142**] - NO MRI!!
Gait: not tested  Pertinent Results: As of [**2180-1-3**]  CBC: 10/44/301 diff 57/25/11 Chem:  140/4.2/108/27/8/0.8/119 Cal 8.6, phos 2.5, mag 1.9 PTT: 68 (on heparin), INR 1.1 ESR: 5 [**Doctor First Name **]: pending Chol 151, LDL 97, HDL 47, TG 63 Tox: acetaminophen 8.6 Ruled OUT for MI  Blood Cx [**2180-1-1**] pending  TTE: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Air bubble contrast imaging did not demonstrate the presence of right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum, but the study is technically suboptimal.
The presence of right heart chamber enlargement raises the suspicion of the presence of an atrial septal defrect with left-to-right shunt, but this  abnormality was not demonstrated on limited color-flow imaging.
Continued evoluation of a known right MCA territory infarct.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Acute right middle cerebral artery territory infarct.
No intracranial hemorrhage identified.
[**2179-12-31**]:  No definite intracranial hemorrhage is seen on this study performed 90 minutes after a contrast-enhanced study.
Contrast enhancement limits evaluation for subtle intra or extra-axial hemorrhage.
Occlusion of the right internal carotid artery distal to the bifurcation of the common carotid artery within the neck.
There is, however, reconstitution of flow within the intracranial right internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery branches, possibly from collateral flow through the anterior communicating artery.
Exam:  left hemiparesis (plegia in the arm, but paresis in the leg with some adduction), improved left visual neglect and left sided sensation.
This patient was given t-PA without complication on [**2179-12-31**].
Angiography  on [**2180-1-1**] showed right ICA dissection with pseudoaneurysm.
He was given asprin, then transitioned to IV heparin drip and coumadin on [**2179-1-2**] after repeated NCHCTs showed no hemorrhage and < [**1-2**] of right hemisphere involved in the stroke.
The dissection was likely caused by his fall onto the ice while shoveling, however ESR and [**Doctor First Name **] were sent as part of the work up.
He complained of a headache, occipital, radiating to the front of the head, reproducible with pressure applied to greater occipital nerve.
Most likely etiology is occipital neuralgia s/p fall on ice.
Given percocet for the pain and compazine (to prevent emesis as could worsen dissection).
Neurontin should help pain as well.
TTE showed no PFO, no veggitations or clot.
Prophylaxis - Pneumoboots, PPI, RISS, on heparin drip  FULL CODE  Medications on Admission: Medications prior to admission: Wellbutrin 400 Ritalin 20 Antabuse Thiamine 1 Neurontin prn insomnia, up to 1000 mg   Discharge Medications: 1.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Condition: Stable - left hemiplegia of face arm and leg (mild adduction of left leg is present).
Passed swallow evaluation.
