Acute coronary syndrome 3.
History of Present Illness:  78 year old man has a history of CAD s/p 3V CABG, Diabetes, HTN, CRI and PVD s/p bilateral BKA?????
Pt c/o midsternal CP radiating to back, took 2 NTGs w/o relief.
Pt c/o increased pain with inspiration, given ASA 81mg x2 en-route to OSH.
Pt had [**7-6**] CP and had 1mm ST elevations in septal leads.
Patient had ongoing chest pain.
Patient continued to have chest pain while in cath lab.
Admits to persistent pain in bilateral lower extremities.
Past Medical History: Diabetes MAT CAD CHF, last ECHO EF 60% ([**4-2**]) SVT HTN Hyperlipidemia DVT/PE s/p b/l BKA COPD Early Alzheimer's PVD Prostate CA s/p resection Gout Depression/anxiety Anemia Obesity    Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink NECK: Supple with no JVP.
No thrills, lifts.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls, and the distal lateral and distal inferior walls.
The apex is mildly aneurysmal akinetic.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction suggestive of CAD (mid-LAD distribution).
No pleural effusion.
Thoracic aorta tortuous or dilated, but unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
Selective angiography in this right dominant patient revealed severe native three vessel CAD.
The left main had no significant stenosis.
The RCA had diffuse disease to 80% distal and was a small vessel.
There was some competetive flow from the very large slow flowing SVG-RCA.
Grafts angiography showed the SVG-RCA to be patent with very slow flow due to the tremendous size mismatch between graft and native vessel.
Acute coronary syndrome 3.
[**12-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions.
Extensive anterolateral myocardial infarction, age undetermined.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo male with h/o 3V CABG (LIMA-D1, SVG-LAD, SVG-RCA), s/p balloon angioplasty to OM1 [**4-3**], DM, PVD s/p bilateral BKA presents with chest pain and 1mm STEMI in septal leads found to have occluded SVG-LAD now s/p 5 BMS.
# s/p STEMI: Patient was transfered from OSH with elevated troponins and 1mm ST elevations in septal and lateral leads.
At Cath, patient found to have complete occlusion of SVG-LAD graft.
Patient had persistent chest pain during the procedure that persisted after transfer to floor.
- Continue Toprol XL 100mg daily - Continue Lisinopril 20mg daily - Continue Simvastatin 80mg daily  # Chronic systolic heart failure:  Echo [**2190-12-20**] shows EF 35% with moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls, distal lateral and distal inferior walls.
The apex is mildly aneurysmal and akinetic.
Mr. [**Known lastname 33754**] remained euvolemic on throughout his sat and was continued on his home dose of Lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
# RHYTHM: Patient has history of paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation however was in normal sinus rhythm throughout his stay.
Additionally, he has a history of DVT/PE in the past.
Mr. [**Known lastname 33754**]' PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and he is apparently taking this for a recent COPD exacerbation.
