Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-7-22**] the rhythm is now atrial fibrillation which is being tracked by the pacemaker.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 F with history of ischemic cardiomypathy (EF previously 30%) sp [**Hospital 3941**] transfered from OSH for V tach and acute on chronic systolic heart failure.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Acute on chronic Systolic heart failure: The patient's EF was 30% few weeks prior to admission, then on admission found to be 10%.
The acute worsening of systolic function was likely triggered by Ventricular tahycardia and heart failure.
Troponins were not elevated at OSH making another acute ischemic event less likely, however given no history of cath but + history of inferior-posterior MI, it was unclear whether the exacerbation was due to an ischemic event.
The patient was initially hypotensive and dyspneic on arrival to CCU.
Patient agreed to workup of her heart disease and etiology of the CHF exacerbation, see below in Coronary Artery Disease.
# Arrhythmias: The patient suffered 2 episodes of ventricular Tachcyardia episodes on day of admission likely from scar from inferior region.
She also has chronic atrial fibrillation and takes coumadin at home.
The coumadin was held (as was heparin gtt) upon admission due to suspicion of a splenic hematoma on OSH CT scan (see below).
After stabilization of her splenic hematoma a heparin gtt was initiated with PTT goal of 50-70.
Patient was started on amiodarone while in house loading dose 200 TID for 7 g total, pt was continued 200TID (last day [**8-1**]), then on [**8-2**] decreased dose to 200 daily for maintenance.
Patient has a low EF and LBBB and we thought she would benefit from a BiV palcement.
On [**8-4**] surgery took her to for Upgrade of VVI-ICD to biventricular-pacer- ICD with addition of epicardial left ventricular pacing lead and transvenous atrial lead and she was also cardioverted at this time.
As a complicaton there was a minor left ventricular perforation at the time of the left ventricular lead implant which was oversewn.
#Splenic Infarct: CT at OSH showed suspected splenic infarct vs. hematoma.
We trended her hematocrits every 6 hours and got another repeat CT scan which showed stable blood counts and no interval change in hematoma.
Etiology of spleic infarct and hemhorragic conerversion werent clear however it is likely patient through a clot from her A-fib which caused splenic infarct then led to hemhorragic conversion.
CT surgery recommended we restart anticoagulation because of her Afib and we put her back on heparin drip with goal PTT 50-60.
# Coronary artery disease: Pt has history of ischemic Cardiomyopathy due to history of MI in past.
Given the documented MI in the past, it was postulated that ongoing coronary artery disease was the possible culprit for the CHF exacerbation/VTach.
She underwent a viability study on [**7-27**] which showed Severe resting perfusion defect of the apex, entire distal ventricle and entire mid ventricle, indicating low probability of recovery of function of these segments after revascularization.
On [**7-28**] we got cardiac perfusion persantine showing fixed, severe, very large perfusion defect involving the LAD territory and Increased left ventricular cavity size.
Severe systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the apex, entire distal ventricle and the entire mid ventricle.
#C diff: Pt presented with an elevated WBC 19 with predominant polys.
She subesquently had diarrhea differtnial was from starting the colchicine vs Cdif.
# Acute renal failure: Cr 1.4 initialy at OSH then improved to 1.1 , now 1.4 and has been stable for a few days.
Differential: pre-renal in setting of CHF and low intravascular volume, AIN in setting of penicillin antibiotics at OSH, ATN (preceeded by pre-renal), foley in so less likely obstruction and post-renal.
Renal vein thrombus and renal artery clot also possible in pt with known A fib and ?splenic infarcts in the past.
Given her exposure to contrast on the first CT abdomen in house, contrast nephropathy was the likely culprit for her [**Last Name (un) **] though pre-renal CHF was also likely a cause.
# Diabetes type 2: Patient was on Insulin sliding scale.
#CHF: will follow up with cardiologist #Diarrhea: being treated for recurrent Cdif with flagyl.
If patient develops cdiff again she should get PO vanco #Arrythmias: patient has history of Afib and was cardioverted while in house and went into sinus but she is at high risk for converting back to Afib and this should be followed up by cardiologist in outpatient setting.

You were admitted with congestive heart failure and a dangerous heart rhythm called ventricular tachycardia.
Your weight at discharge is 145 pounds and you need to keep your weight here to prevent fluid overload.
Please weigh yourself every day and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 91348**] if your weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
You are on warfarin (coumadin) to prevent a stroke resulting from the atrial fibrillation.
