Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1) intubation and ventilation 2) right wrist arthrocentesis 3) bronchoscopy 4) echocardiogram   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 56 year old man with a past medical history significant for hepatitis C, on interferon, COPD, yearly pneumonias, with one in [**2163**] that required medical induced coma and ventilator for one month who developed fever and shortness of breath over the past three days.
Subsequently, he developed three days of progressive fever, nonproductive cough, and shortness of breath.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] the past twenty four hours, the patient became more weak and had increased shortness of breath.
Chest xray revealed interstitial and alveolar edema, so he received IV lasix.
Had traumatic foley insertion on admission which resulted in transfusion of 7 units of PRBCs during his ICU stay as well as CBI for large bladder clot.
By the time he was tx'ed to 11 [**Hospital Ward Name **], his urine was clear and the foley was removed, although he continued to pass intermittant small clots (per GU this was expected)  Shortly after admission, he grew out strep pneumomonia in his blood cx's from admission and his sputum had MRSA.
Was seen by ID in ICU because of persistent fevers.
-History of GI bleed in [**2164**]: Grade [**11-20**] esophagitis with no bleeding in the lower third of the esophagus.
No definite varices were seen ([**2170-10-19**]).
-History of severe pneumonia (required intubation in [**2163**]); yearly pneumonias that usually resolve with outpatient antibiotics.
-H/O chronic osteomyelitis of the spine as well as multifocal osteomyelitis.
-Endocarditis in the early [**2153**]'s.
-Bilateral carpal tunnel surgery.
Left JVP appeared at 8cm, but difficult to assess with intubation.
Normal S1 and S2, with 3/6 systolic murmur at left lower sternal border.
No rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**] appreciated.
No wheezing appreciated.
In left upper quadrant, indurated 10x5cm erythematous patch with mild scale on border edge.
No splenomegaly appreciated.
No clubbing or cyanosis.
2+ dorsalis pedis and radial pulses, bilaterally.
[**4-26**] CXR Lung volumes have improved since [**4-25**] along with a component of pulmonary edema, but there is still extensive opacification in the lower lungs and a suggestion of cavitation bilaterally which would be due to pneumonia.
Heart size is normal and there is no appreciable mediastinal vascular engorgement.
There is no pneumothorax.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.
[**4-30**] CT HEAD FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus.
There is atherosclerotic disease within the vertebral and internal carotid arteries.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Consolidation in the lower lobes and nodular opacities in the upper lobes bilaterally consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, partially loculated at the apex; however, no evidence for empyema.
4-mm non-obstructing stone in the lower pole of the left kidney.
Mild periportal lymphadenopathy, likely due to the patient's known hepatitis.
TEE: Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are no aortic atheroma to 35 cm past the incisors.
TTE: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared to the prior study dated [**2171-4-26**], tricupsid regurgitation is more prominent (may not have been as well characterized on the prior study).
Acute Renal Failure due to Acute Interstitial Nephritis - Presumed due to Zosyn - Renal was consulted, no eos's in urine, but timing with rash classic for AIN, and steady resolution was consistent with time course - Medications were renally dosed - Given the ARF, we did not start NSAIDS for pseudogout  2.
Pseudogout - Rheum consulted [**2171-5-7**] for wrist swelling - Arthrocentesis of right wrist with calcium pyrophosphate crystals - oral prednisone with symptomatic improvement, as NSAIDs were contraindicated due to his ARF - Pain control with topical lidocaine, oxycodone  3.
Pneumococcal Pneumonia - Extubated [**5-8**] after failing multiple trials in ICU - O2 Sats were normal on arrival to floor - Treated with Vanco/Zosyn, now off both - Incentive Spirometry - Nebulizers  4.
Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Massive Hematuria due to traumatic foley catheter insertion - Transfused 7units PRBC - CBI was used - GU consultation - HCT stable - No further gross hematuria - GU notes may be several days of passing additional clots  5.
Lidocaine 5 %(700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Sig: One (1) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Topical once a day as needed for pain for 7 days: Apply for 12 hours only in a 24 hour period.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain for 15 days.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1) puff Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Pneumococcal sepsis with hypotension requiring pressor support 2) multifocal pneumonia with respiratory failure 3) acute renal failure 4) hematuria with bladder hematoma 5) acute blood loss anemia 6) Pseudogout flare of right wrist 7) MRSA in sputum  Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Return to the hospital if you have chest pain, fevers/chills, shortness of breath,  Followup Instructions: 1) PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
