HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89 year old female with a history of significant coronary artery disease and ejection fraction of less than 15% who, on the day of admission, was in her usual state of health until around 10 p.m. when she was sitting in a chair and felt increasing shortness of breath with associates increase in heart rate and palpitations.
Denies chest pain or nausea.
The EMS arrived and found patient to be in moderate respiratory distress with respiratory rate in the 30s and oxygen saturations in the mid-80s.
Coronary artery disease with ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% per [**2146-8-17**] echocardiogram.
Non-Q wave myocardial infarction in [**2146-8-17**] (the patient refused cardiac catheterization at that time); two plus mitral regurgitation with severe left ventricular hypokinesis.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, diet controlled.
Multi-focal neuropathy.
He does not smoke cigarettes and drinks occasional alcohol.
Pulmonary is clear to auscultation bilaterally with no evidence of crackles, rhonchi or wheezing.
Extremities with trace pedal edema bilaterally with one plus distal pulses.
Old T wave inversion in leads AVR and AVL.
Old ST elevations in V1 through V4.
Old ST depressions in V4 and V5, biphasic T waves in V5 with new ST depressions and biphasic T wave in V6.
Chest x-ray at time of admission is gross pulmonary edema with question opacification of left retrocardiac area  Urinalysis positive nitrites, small leukocyte esterase, zero to two white blood cells, many bacteria, zero red blood cells.
No yeast or epithelial cells.
Cardiovascular:  The patient with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 15% per [**2146-8-17**] echocardiogram.
It was felt that the patient's rapid improvement with diuresis and blood pressure control makes flash pulmonary edema the most likely diagnosis upon admission.
There was a question of possible infiltrate causing hypoxia and dyspnea, however, with intravenous diuresis a repeat chest x-ray did not reveal any focal infiltrate.
The patient was ruled out for myocardial ischemia as possible etiology of flash pulmonary edema and diffuse primarily old EKG changes.
As the patient had no symptoms of chest pain or EKG changes, the decision was made to continue medical management and have the patient follow-up with primary care physician as an outpatient.
The patient remained chest pain free throughout this hospitalization and continued to remain stable on outpatient medical regimen.
Pulmonary:  After initial episode of hypoxia, the patient remained stable status post intravenous diuresis and afterload reduction.
A repeat PA and lateral chest x-ray was done to rule out infiltrate status post diuresis which revealed no infiltrates.
The patient had no cough, fever or sputum production.
She did receive a single dose of Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the Emergency Department prior to diuresis for possible pneumonia as etiology of shortness of breath.
The antibiotics were not continued as the patient had no leukocytosis or fever.
Her fever curve and white blood cell count were monitored throughout this hospitalization and remained negative.
A repeat urine culture was drawn given a positive nitrites with increased bacteria in her urinalysis.
She is to follow-up with her primary care physician should she develop symptoms of dysuria or fever.
Endocrine:  The patient is a type 2 diabetic who, in the past, has controlled her diabetes mellitus with diet alone.
She was continued on Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and Fosamax for osteoporosis.
