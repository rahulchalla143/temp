There he was noted to have transaminitis, coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
During ICU stay, patient was started on mucomyst for elevated INR (peak 14.1 [**2153-4-30**] and transaminitis (ALT [**Numeric Identifier **], AST 7208) and ARF.
Now transfered to medical [**Hospital1 **] team for monitoring and transition to outpatient psych facility.

2) No variant hepatic arterial, portal venous, or hepatic venous anatomy.
CT Chest [**2153-4-30**]: There is a large pleural effusion on the right,  with right lower lobe collapse and consolidation  ECHO: 1.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
CXR IMPRESSION: New bilateral pleural effusions (right>left), Given the clinical history, underlying pneumonia at the right base and/or aspiration not excluded; correlate clinically.
Post Thoracentesis CXR IMPRESSION: Status post thoracentesis with resolution of right-sided pleural effusion; no pneumothorax identified.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.
CONSISTENT WITH CORYNEBACTERIUM ANDPROPIONIBACTERIUM SPECIES.
FURTHER IDENTIFICATION TO FOLLOW  Brief Hospital Course: Tylenol Overdose The patient was admitted after ingesting a significant amount of tylenol in a suicide gesture with grossly abnormal liver function tests and coagulation profile.
He was hospitalized and supported for acute liver failure.
Transplant surgery was following but in light of improving clinical picture and labs during hospitalization, there was ultimately no indication for liver transplant.
His pain was controlled with morphine as needed.
Acute Renal Failure The patient had mild transient renal failure (peak Cr 1.0) that resolved during hospitalization.
Coagulopathy [**12-27**] acute liver injury.
Hepatitis C Incidentally, the patient was found to be hepatitis C antibody positive.
He reported that he had been HCV negative two years ago and since that time had not had unprotected sex or injected drugs, but had had tatoos done since then.
A U/A showed only trace protein.
?Pneumonia The patient was found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate on imaging and was mildly hypoxic on transfer to the medicine service.
He had developed a mild leukocytosis and had been started on levofloxacin and flagyl for a question of aspiration pneumonia (the patient initially had an NGT in place though he was never intubated).
He had an associated right-sided pleural effusion for which he underwent a thoracentesis which showed an exudative effusion without evidence of empyema and with a negative culture.
His hypoxia resolved and his CXR post procedure showed no evidence of a pneumothorax and showed impressive resolution of the opacification in the right lower lobe.
Thrombocytopenia Nadir of 26 and likely multifactorial: EtOH abuse, poor nutritional status and acute liver failure.
No spontaneous bleeding.
?GIB Patient had a history of coffee ground emesis.
An NG lavage showed coffee grounds with clearing.
His HCT dropped with hydration but remained thereafter stable and he had no further episodes of coffee ground emesis, BRBPR, melena or any other symptoms concerning for GI bleed.
