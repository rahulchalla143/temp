Postoperatively, he has developed persistent ascites leak of nearly 2 liters per day, as well as a small [**Year (4 digits) **] leak.
He has undergone ERCP and endoscopic stenting.
There has been no diminution in the tempo of the leak and he is therefore brought to the operating room for exploration, oversewing of the presumed [**Year (4 digits) **] leak and identification of the source of ascites.
It should be noted that he did have venous studies that demonstrated no evidence of portal hypertension."
Past Medical History: heavy EtOH HTN cholangiocarcinoma & hepatocellullar carcinoma, s/p segment IVb resection, cholecystectomy, intraoperative ultrasound ([**2135-7-8**]) [**Month/Day/Year **] leak from cut surface s/p drainage and ERCP with stent ([**2135-7-21**]) esophageal candidiasis  Social History: Has a college education.

Postop, he was in a lot of pain with pain score of [**9-9**].
Pain lessened.
A Portal vein study on POD 6 Normal hepatic and portal venous pressure.
Patient did well but continued to drian large volumes of fluid and liver US was performed [**9-29**] which showed fluid collection, stable, in surgical bed.
Patient had a CT scan on [**10-6**] prior to discharge which was significant for 1) Fluid collection at the hepatic resection site again noted with slight increase in the overall amount of fluid as detailed above and 2) Small right pleural effusion again seen, slightly increased in size since the prior examination.
As patient tolerated PO he was changed to oral pain medication, and by the last week of stay he was transferred slowly to methadone.
