His cultures from L heel ulcer also grew dense proteus so this was felt to be the source.
PVD-  The worsening of his heel ulcer over the prior 2 weeks was found to be secondary to decreased flow in his L bypass graft.
Given the improvement in his distal blood flow it was felt that the L heel osteomyelitis might respond to conservative treatment with abx and wound care.

Rectus sheath hematoma-  During hospital course pt developed rectus sheath hematoma at sight of heparin injections.

He had a MRI of his head which revealed diffuse microvascular dz but no acute CVA.
Patient with 90% stenosis of R carotid artery, however refusing surgical intervention.
Pain - The patient has some pain from the ulcer, as well as from the rectus sheath hematoma.
We have started oxycodone 2.5 mg QID, as well as PRN, which is keeping his pain well-controlled.
Given his poor prognosis, goals of care were discussed and patient and family agreed to current treatment plan which included antibiotics and transfusions as necessary but avoiding major surgical interventions.
Oxycodone HCl 5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for breakthrough pain.
