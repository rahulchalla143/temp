There is increased streaky density in the right lung likely representing subsegmental atelectasis and interval increase in a re-distribution of a small right effusion.
There is streaky density at the left base most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Increased streaky density on the right likely representing subsegmental atelectasis.
Interval increase in or re-distribution of small right effusion.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Mildly dilated LV cavity.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Conclusions Pre CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler, echodense material seen at likely site of prior ASD repair.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Two eccentric jets of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation are seen.
There is no aortic insufficiency.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2146-12-9**] where the patient underwent a redo sternotomy and attempted repair of mitral regurgitation.
Attempted repair of mitral regurgitation.
Beta blocker therapy was held secondary to post-operative juctional rhythm which recovered to a normal sinus rhythm.
At the time of discharge on POD #6 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
