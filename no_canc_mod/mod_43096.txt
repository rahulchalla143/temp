He denied any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
No radiating pain.
No fevers or chills.
No flank pain.
The patient denied any other symptoms including shortness of breath, cough, sputum, chest pain, or palpitations.
The patient tried taking some Gas-X without relief.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm, status post repair times three in [**2139**], [**2146**], and [**2155**].
History of transient ischemic attack.
Left carotid stenosis; status post carotid endarterectomy.
History of renal artery aneurysm; status post repair in [**2144**].
Peripheral vascular disease.
History of cerebellar and pontine hemorrhages.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy; status post transurethral resection of prostate.
Hepatitis C with a negative viral load.
Peripheral neuropathy.
Right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
He was in no acute distress.
The neck was supple without any jugular venous distention.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no rales.
There was a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.
The abdomen was soft, mildly distended, with slight tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic and lower abdominal areas.
There was no rebound or peritoneal signs.
No edema was noted.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  On laboratory examination, complete blood count was significant for a slightly elevated white blood cell count of 14.3.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  On electrocardiogram, the patient was in a sinus rhythm at 77, with left axis, left anterior fascicular block, prolonged P-R interval, left ventricular hypertrophy with strain.
There were bilateral iliac aneurysms and mildly prominent small bowel loops located in the middle third of the small bowel with no definite transition point suggestive of a small bowel obstruction.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a hypertensive urgency as well as with signs of a potential small-bowel obstruction.
He was admitted for a Nipride drip as well as for administration of by mouth contrast for an abdominal computed tomography with by mouth contrast to better define the likely small-bowel obstruction and transition point.
On examination at that time, the patient had been developing diffuse rales bilaterally with an oxygen saturation dropping to the high 80s and low 90s despite 100% nonrebreather.
