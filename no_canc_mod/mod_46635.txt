Name:  [**Known lastname 11650**],[**Known firstname **]                    Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 11651**]  Admission Date:  [**2166-5-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-6-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2148-12-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3524**] Addendum: 17 yo male who was jumping on a trampoline and landed on his head.
OSH noted no movement in bilateral lower extremities and no  sensation from nipple line down.
Imaging showed C4-C5 disc herniation, ligament injury and spinal cord contusion at this level causing complete C4-C5 cord injury.
Diagnostic venogram of IVC and iliac veins and placement of Optease IVC filter was perform for DVT prophylaxis on [**2166-6-3**] Chest CT on [**6-13**] showed near collapse of the left lower lobe and  diffuse nodular ground-glass opacity throughout the right lower lobe, suggestive of atypical infection and/or very early consolidation.
A bronch was performed on [**6-14**] for persistent hight temperatures BAL cultures negative.
Pt was pan cultured several times for increased temperature all cultures had been negative.
Psychiatry assessment revealed normal greef.Psychiatry recommendations were the following: 1) The pt appears to be experiencing normal grief 2) Continue to monitor mood and sleep 3) [**Month (only) 412**] offer Ativan 1mg PO prn anxiety or panic if it develops 4) Continue to involve SW in case, offer educational materials 5) Cont to involve pt?????
?s family in case 6) Discussed with primary team, [**Last Name (LF) 11652**],[**Name8 (MD) 11653**], MD Beeper#: [**Numeric Identifier 11654**] 7) Psychiatry will continue to follow, please page with questions #[**Numeric Identifier 11655**], or Psychiatry on call nights/weekends #[**Numeric Identifier 11656**]; Last evaluation form speech and swallow where the following: SECRETIONS / ABILITY TO HANDLE CUFF DEFLATION:Cuff was deflated prior to our evaluation and pt was tolerating cuff deflation without O2 desaturation or distress.
PMV TOLERANCE / VOCAL QUALITY / O2 SATS:Pt was able to achieve voicing upon placement of the valve and at first noted that it felt hard to exhale with the valve in place.
It is recommended that the valve be removed when pt complains of discomfort, effortful breathing, or fatigue.
We also discussed adjusting positioning as needed if valve tolerance appears difficult.
However, as per the recommendations  from previous evaluations, swallow eval was deferred today, especially in light of potential discharge to rehab yesterday, and evidence of LLL collapse, RLL ground opacity on prior chest CT. PT is just beginning to demonstrate improved endurance and respiratory drive to tolerate the valve.
As such, would prefer to allow him to establish consistent strength/endurance for this prior to assessing swallowing, as he has already demonstrated inability to tolerate aspiration (prior to Trach placement) in the setting of poor respiratory reserve.
Pt as remained afebrile for 36 hours.
