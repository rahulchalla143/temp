History of Present Illness: 51yo male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus who presents to OSH after syncopal event on [**10-26**].
While at the OSH, he underwent an extensive work-up for his syncope.
During this process, he developed persistent fevers, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and liver failure.
Neurology evaluated the patient given syncopal event and underwent negative EEG and CT head.
No LP was done as there was no suspicion for on-going meningitis.
He underwent an ECHO which some LVH with normal EF and no pulmonary HTN.
CT chest and CT sinus were negative for any infection and he satted about 92% on RA.
As mentioned, the patient was found to have acute elevation of his liver enzymes.
He had no abdominal pain, jaundice, nausea or vomiting.
RUQ U/S did not show any inflammation or ductal dilatation.
He also became leukopenic, which is of unclear etiology.
There was some concern that it could be secondary to Enabrel.
Smear showed leukopenia with left shift and normochromic, normocytic anemia.
There was no evidence of schistocytes, acute leukemia, inclusion bodies or toxin granulation.
ID was consulted given fevers and underlying marrow suppression.
Of note the patient denies any recent travel, tick bites, or new rashes.
The patient reports feeling warm but denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dizziness, LH, or syncope.
Diabetes Mellitus 2.
Hypertension 3.
Hyperlipidemia 4.
Insomnia 7.
Family History: Diabetes and hypertension on maternal side of his family.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: VS: T- 103.4, BP- 160/80, HR- 103, RR- 20, SaO2- 95% on RA GENERAL: Mildly distressed but resting.
ABDOMEN: Soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding.
SKIN: No rashes or lesions.
Mild gallbladder wall hyperenhancement with surrounding band of fat stranding, portocaval lymph nodes, and presence of peritoneal fluid might be explained by current episode of hepatitis.
However, if cholecystitis remains a consideration clinically a right upper quadrant ultrasound might be considered.
Small pulmonary nodules are non specific and ahould be followed up with a chest CT in 12 months as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] Society guidelines if the patient has no history of smoking or malignancy.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are observed.
Mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were also present.
Left lobe liver hypodensity is too small to characterize.
BMBx [**2165-10-31**]: HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH FOCAL STROMAL DAMAGE, INCREASED APOPTOSIS AND OCCASIONAL HEMOPHAGOCYTIC HISTIOCYTE.
THESE FINDINGS, IN THE CLINICAL SETTING OF PANCYTOPENIA, HEPATIC [**Month/Day/Year **], EXTREME HYPERFERRITINEMIA, HYPOFIBRINOGENEMIA AND HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA ARE CONSISTENT WITH ACQUIRED HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Mild right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
[**2165-11-7**] LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT.
[**2165-11-7**] EEG: IMPRESSION: These findings are consistent with initial non-convulsive status epilepticus, resolving with treatment (IV levetiracetam), and improvement in the background activity to moderate diffuse slowing consistent with a moderate diffuse encephalopathy.
Widening of the mediastinum is stable, and there is no tracheal displacement or other finding to suggest that there is any mediastinal bleeding.
There is no pleural effusion and the lungs are clear.

He was intubated for agitation and airway protection [**2165-10-31**] after becoming dyspneic, tachypneic, and having chest pain.
EEG initially showed frequent subclinical seizures.
ICU course was complicated by hypernatremia to 150 which improved with free water boluses, agitation/delerium which improved with levetiracetam and haloperidol, sinus tachycardia to HR 150, and steroid-induced hyperglycemia.
Abx were stopped [**2165-11-9**] despite fevers (due to HLH).
# Febrile Neutropenia - Initially febrile when presented to outside hospital, and with WBC of 3.
Became neutropenic down to WBC 0.8 prior to transfer.
On transfer he remained febrile up to 103 with relief only from cooling blankets due to inability to take acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
# Anemia - Initially his hematocrit was stable around 37 for most of his hospitalization, but on [**11-1**] it dropped to 30 and then subsequently to 26 later that day.
# Thrombocytopenia - His platelet counts were initially normal at the OSH and trended steadily downward to 60 on admission, and then remained around 30.
# Hepatitis - His LFTs were initially normal at the OSH, and then began to increase, initially to ALT/AST ~400, then ~1200 but stable for two days.
Ferritin continued to elevate up to [**Numeric Identifier 36021**], likely acute phase reactant.
Rheumatology was formally consulted and felt the most likely diagnosis was HLH, and recommended starting IVIG, which he received once.
# Diabetes: On U500 as an outpatient, with unclear glucose levels or insulin requirements.
# Hypertension: Held atenolol and benicar in the setting of recent syncopal event and report of bradycardia at OSH.
# Syncopal event- could have been vagal or secondary to hypotension given high fevers.
MICU course: Patient transferred to MICU [**Location (un) 2452**] given new respiratory symptoms and oxygen requirement.
He did not tolerate increased rate and developed rigors and fevers, which could also have been secondary to underlying disease process.
Given duration of illness and likelihood that sepsis would have declared itself, we resumed his beta-blockade with metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] with plans to resume [**Last Name (un) **] if BPs were stable on [**11-2**].
He was started on PPI in the setting of recent Hct drop and stools were guaiac-ed (results**).
RUQ U/S (with dopplers) showed no gallbladder pathology with normal hepatic vasculature.
A bone marrow biopsy was done which revealed hypercellular bone marrow with increased apoptosis and occasional hemophagocytic histiocyte.
Prior to transfer, the patient was noted to be acutely agitated and had to be intubated for airway protection.
An EEG was performed, which was concerning for seizure activity.
Neurology was consulted who felt that he may have been having subclinical seizures and he was started on antiepileptics.
He denied hitting his head, and there was no evidence of head trauma.
- Calcium and vitamin D to prevent bone loss while on steroids.
# Pancytopenia: Due to HLH and chemotherapy.
Trace positive stool guaic.
Avoid NSAIDs and heparin with low PLTs.
# Coagulopathy: PTT up to 71 (with Factor IX 41%) now normalized.
# [**Month/Day/Year 5779**]: Due to HLH.
# Seizure d/o and delirium: Due to HLH.
# Thigh hematoma: Due to BM biopsy, coagulopathy, and pancytopenia.
# Hypertension: Restarted olmesartan (initially held due to syncope).
# Hypernatremia: Due to osmotic diuresis with hyperglycemia, resolved.
# FEN: Regular diabetic diet.
Hypernatremia resolved with IV fluids.
# DVT Prophylaxis: Pneumatic boots.
# Access: PICC.
# Precautions: Fall.
# Contact: Wife.
# Code: Full.
# Pulmonary Nodule:  CT with Scattered pulmonary nodules measuring up to 5 mm needs f/u CT in 12 months.
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), bone marrow disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
Hypertension (high blood pressure).
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital directly from another hospital due to fainting (syncope), pancytopenia (low blood counts), [**Hospital **], altered mental state, and fever.
Hematology performed a bone marrow biopsy; this confirmed the diagnosis of HLH (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), a bone marrow disease that destroys blood cells.
While you were in the hospital, your confusion and agitation worsened when you were feeling short of breath.
Levetiracetam (Keppra) for seizure disorder.
