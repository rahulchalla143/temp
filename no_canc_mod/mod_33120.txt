It was felt this bleeding was related to the recent ERCP and sphincterotomy you had at [**Hospital1 4259**] earlier this month.
This medication will help this spot in your intestine heal and will also help decrease any inflammation in your small intenstine that was seen on the endoscopy at [**Hospital3 **].
Your primary care doctor or cardiologist may want to restart these as your anemia improves and your blood pressure increases.
If you feel lightheaded, please stop taking this medication as one of its side-effects is lightheadness and fainting.
