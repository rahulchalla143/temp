Admission Date:  [**2110-7-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-7-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Plaquenil / Glyburide  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2110-7-11**] Cardiac catheterization [**2110-7-12**] Pericardiocentesis with drain placement and L+R heart cath  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o HTN, rheumatoid arthritis and gallstones (but no cholecystitis) presents with 1 day history of chest pain.
Was in her USOH when yesterday afternoon ([**7-10**]) she began having a "choking sensation"-like pain in her chest.
Pain was worse with lying down, associated with some dizziness and diaphoresis, but no shortness of breath, nausea, or palpitations.
Also noticed yesterday that her urine was darker than normal, but stool was still normal color.
Pain continued to get worse until she told her sister at 2 AM "I feel like I'm having a heart attack", so her sister rushed her to the [**Name (NI) **].
She had never had a pain like this before, no history of reflux disease.
At baseline walks around her house and occasionally outside with a cane, but only goes short distances because of gait instability.
ECG notable for SR @ 89 with ?ST-elevations and hyperacute T waves in anterolateral leads with Q waves that are new compared to last prior ECG in [**2107**].
LFTs revealed bili 4.4 (4.1 indirect), so RUQ obtained and showed gallstones with no sign of obstruction.
CXR showed no acute abnormalities.
Bedside US showed small pericardial effusion but no evidence of aortic dissection (no comment on WMAs).
Chest pain resolved but then came back, responded well to morphine.
On arrival to the floor, the patient was feeling comfortable with no chest pain since receiving morphine in the ED.
She relayed the above story with no difficulty and with excellent memory and attention to detail.
Shortly after her arrival, she began to have chest pain again, same in quality as her previous chest pain.
Also complained of feeling very very weak.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 109444**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of hypertension (HTN), rheumatoid arthritis and gallstones (but no cholecystitis) who presented with 1 day history of chest pain and anemia, thought to be hemolytic.
She was found to have a large STEMI with placement of bare metal stent.
Course complicated by large pericardial effusion and subsequent cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis and transfer to the CCU, as well as hypotension requiring pressors and acute kidney injury.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:  # ST elevation myocardial infarction:  Shortly after her arrival to the floor, she began to have chest pain again.
ECG showed evolving/worsening ST-elevations in the anteroseptal leads.
Bedside echo showed anterior wall hypokinesis with depressed EF of 25% (from 75%) prompting transfer to the cath lab.
Patient had a right femoral artery approach with mostly single vessel LAD disease with a 90% proximal ostial LAD lesion, s/p BMS placement.
During the cath, she suffered a brief period of hypotension with systolics in the high 60's mmHg associated with balloon inflation, otherwise systolics maintained in the mid 100's mm Hg range.
After developing pericardial effusion (see below), her aspirin dose was decreased to 162mg to avoid bleeding complications, and her statin was stopped due to transaminitis.
# Cardiac tamponade: On the floor post-cath, started to have episodes of hypotension, with blood pressures dropped from 121/58 to 58/38, after using bedpan for a bowel movement.
Physical exam concerning revealed elevated JVP and crackles on exam.
STAT bedside echo revealed large pericardial effusion causing early tamponade.
She was sent urgently back to the cath lab, where 600 cc of frank blood was drained from the pericardium, complicated by a small puncture of the right ventricle.
She had signficant bleeding so she was given a total of 4units PRBC.
The drain output was low over the next day, so this was pulled the following day with no evidence of fluid reaccumulation.
Cause of her tamponade is not entirely clear-- no dye extravasation seen from coronary arteries on repeat cath during pericardiocentesis, however she may have had a small puncture that then clotted off.
# Acute kidney injury:  She was noted to be oliguric on [**7-13**] and her urine sediment showed muddy brown casts consistent with ATN from the setting of hypotension.
# Anemia: no recent baseline, but hct was in 36-39 range in 11/[**2109**].
Has noted darkened urine in the past day and has evidence of hemolysis on labs-- indirect bilirubinemia, elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, high retic.
No history of bleeding (no blood in stool), guaiac negative in the ED.
No known liver disease, no hypersplenism on exam, no known hemoglobinopathy.
Received 4 units packed RBCs due to bleeding post-pericardiocentesis (see above) with improvement of hct to 30-36 range.
# Ischemic cardiomyopathy: EF now 25% following anterior STEMI.
Appeared well-compensated without signs of congestive heart failure during admission.
On aspirin 162mg, however not on b-blocker or ACEI due to low BPs and no statin due to transaminitis.
# Transaminitis:  AST 100s, ALT 200s, tBili initially high from hemolysis but trended down to normal, alk phos normal.
Etiology likely due to ischemic injury to the liver during hypotensive episodes plus some degree of passive congestive from heart failure.
# Hyponatremia: Chronic ongoing hyponatremia, stable this admission.
# Hyperbilirubinemia: Seems more likely related to hemolysis (see above) than from hepatobiliary dysfunction.
- Anemia: due to hemolysis (cause unknown) and acute blood loss, should have hct checked at next PCP follow up - FULL CODE (was DNR/DNI while in the CCU, however now wants "to live a little longer")  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Clopidogrel 75 mg PO DAILY for the recommended duration RX *clopidogrel 75 mg once a day Disp #*30 Tablet Refills:*2   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] LivingCenter - Elmhurst - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSES: ST-elevation myocardial infarction Acute kidney injury Cardiac tamponade Acute systolic heart failure Cardiogenic shock Hemolytica and acute blood loss anemia  SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Rheumatoid arthritis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital due to chest pain, and we found that you had a large heart attack.
After the procedure you developed fluid around your heart that needed to be drained, and you were sent to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.
