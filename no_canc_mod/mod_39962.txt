Admission Date:  [**2170-6-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-6-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-5-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**] Chief Complaint: acute renal failure, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Placement of right IJ central line Removal of right IJ central line Placement of left IJ central line Placement of right IJ dialysis line Diagnostic paracentesis   History of Present Illness: 60 year old woman with CKD and HCV cirrhosis s/p OLT [**5-/2164**] c/b recurrent HCV cirrhosis, who was transferred for hypotension and acute renal failure.
The patient initially presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**6-10**] with abdominal pain, N/V, worsening ascites, and shortness of breath.
CXR with small right effusion and elevated R hemidiaphragm but no pneuamonia.
She remained afebrile so the flagyl was eventually stopped.
She was also noted to have worsening acute on CKD.
Admission Cr was 2.6 which rose to 3.3 on the day of transfer with associated hyperkalemia (K up to 6 without reported ekg changes) and oliguria.
It was felt likely due to HRS so midodrine 7.5mg TID was started as well as a bicarb gtt for the hyperkalemia.
Also with thrombocytopenia to 39,000 so patient received 2 units of platelets with increase to 114,000.
She is reporting pain in her abdomen similar to her chronic pain.
Past Medical History: - HCV cirrhosis c/b variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatopulmonary syndrome requiring TIPS, s/p OLT [**2164-6-3**] at [**Hospital3 2358**] -> recurrent HCV and graft cirrhosis treated with interferon and ribavirin but unable to tolerate due to anemia and lack of response -> recurrent hepatopulmonary syndrome with a pO2 of 75 and evidence of shunts on echo -> progressive decompensated liver disease with refractory ascites requiring large volume paracentesis (~6L) every two weeks -> currently undergoing liver transplant evaluation - Chronic kidney disease (baseline Cr 1.5) - Basal cell cancer removed from face requiring skin grafting - Osteopenia - Depression - Anxiety - COPD - GERD - S/p cataract surgery  Social History: Currently lives in [**Location (un) 8973**].
She does not smoke and does not drink any alcohol, but did smoke and drink occasional etoh up until the time of her diagnosis of hepatitis C.   Family History: Unable to obtain due to patient's somnolence.
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds at both bases but otherwise clear, no wheezes, rales, ronchi.
Abdomen: Mildly distended but soft.
+TTP diffusely but no guarding or rebound.
Well healed surgical scar over RUQ.
GU: + foley Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
mild asterixis though patient not cooperating with exam.
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds at both bases but otherwise clear, no wheezes, rales, ronchi.
Well healed surgical scar over RUQ.
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
MICRO: [**2170-6-14**] Blood culture: no growth [**2170-6-15**] Urine culture: no growth [**2170-6-16**] Blood culture: no growth [**2170-6-17**] Peritoneal fluid culture: no growth [**2170-6-17**] Blood culture: no growth to date [**2170-6-18**] CMV VL: not detected [**2170-6-18**] Fungal blood culture: no growth .
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-5-21**], the right ventricle is more dilated and the tricuspid regurgitation is increased.
Echogenic kidneys, compatible with diffuse parenchymal disease.
Small left basal pleural effusion with dependent atelectasis noted in the lung bases bilaterally.
No evidence for abdominal aortic dissection or aneurysm.
Cirrhotic liver with sequela of portal hypertension including ascites, splenomegaly and varices.
Mild cardiomegaly is partially obscured by pleural effusions.
Bibasilar opacities likely on the left side are combination of atelectasis and pleural effusions.
There is mild vascular congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 year old woman with CKD and HCV cirrhosis s/p OLT [**5-/2164**] c/b recurrent HCV cirrhosis, who was transferred for hypotension and acute renal failure.
No diarrhea to suggest a C. diff infection.
# Acute on CKD: Baseline Cr ~1.5.
Renal U/S was negative for obstruction.
# HCV cirrhosis: S/p liver transplant in [**2164**] with recurrence of HCV cirrhosis in the graft.
No evidence of GI or other bleeding.
Hematology was consulted and felt that this is likely due to her underlying cirrhosis and multiple medical comorbidities.
Again, likely to her underlying cirrhosis and multiple medical comorbidities.
# Chronic pain: Patient reported severe full body pain throughout the admission, worse in her back and abdomen.
An MRI torso was negative for any spinal or other acute process.
The pain service was consulted and her pain was managed with prn narcotics and she was eventually started on a dilaudid gtt based on her goals of care.
# Goals of care: After learning that she is not a candidate for another liver transplant, and given her renal and liver failure, the decision was made to focus on comfort.
Dilaudid PCA Concentration: 1 or 2mg/mL Quantity: 500mg x 6 bags Basal rate: 1.2 mg/hour Hourly rate: 0.5mg every 15 minutes 1-hour max: 3.2mg  Basal rate can be adjusted from 1-3 mg/hour   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 2188**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Liver failure Renal failure Anemia Thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: Intermittently alert and oriented   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 **] after you were found to have renal failure and low blood pressures.
We treated you for a possible infection and supported your blood pressure.
You were started on dialysis for your kidneys.
The liver doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 6349**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and unfortunately you are not able to have another liver transplant.
