CT C spine [**2112-12-30**] No acute traumtic injury.
Degenerative changes as above.
CT head [**2112-12-30**] Small amount of right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Gven size and distribution and given history, post traumatic etiology suspected.
No mass effect.
Acute subarachnoid hemorrhage along the sulci in the right frontal lobe at the site of hypodensity seen on CT. 2.
Extensive bifrontal and right medial parietal superficial siderosis.
Mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease 5.
No evidence of acute infarct.
Saddle pulmonary embolism with relatively greater clot burden on the right.
Echocardiography may be useful as clinically indicated to assess for right heart strain.
Small amount of free pelvic fluid is nonspecific.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate-to-severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
He had a head CT which was questionable for a small SAH.
Neurosurgery resident and neurosurgery attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] felt that there was no SAH, and what was seen was artifact.
Pt was found to have large saddle embolus when scanning abdomen for possible ischemic bowel.
Pt was confused and unable to answer questions.
Impression: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y/o man found down, noted in the ED to be hypotensive, w/ desat, AG of 17, BG 500, w/ renal failure Acute vs.
Chronic, noted to have CT read of head w/ debate of artifact vs. SAH, found to have massive pulmonary embolus on CT scan.
# Saddle Pulmonary Embolus: Pt had massive pulmonary embolism, that has lead to ms changes, LOC, hypoxia, hypotension, elevated lactate, leukocytosis, and likely stress response causing glucose elevation.
Pt was hemodynamically unstable from pulmonary embolism.
Discussed final read with all parties.
head imaging showed bleed (confirmed by MRI), no heparin, placed IVC filter pending consensus no head bleed, planned to give intra-pulm cath thrombolytics becaue the benefit of lytics likely outweighs risk at this point in time.
#: Altered Mental Status: Patient found down unconscious, he had an underlying baseline of alzeimers.
Initially felt to be secondary to metabolic or infectious etiology given finding concerning for DKA (glucose 500s, ketones in urine, AG=17) and Sepsis(leukocytosis 18, elevated lactate 5.8, hypotension, desat).
Poor perfusion can cause this patient with baseline dementia to have a worsened mental status.
# Infectious Etiology: clean UA, blood cx pending, no signs of meningitis.
No abd signs of infection on exam or CT. Pt received levoquin 750 IV, flagyl 800mg IV, and ceftriaxone 1gm in ED.
Infection as etiology is very unlikely given how story fits with PE, but will still cover for gram positives for 24 hours.
# ROMI: Patients ECG showed Twave inv v1-v3, otherwise normal.
No reported history of chest pain, but w/ DM need to consider MI.
Unclear if this is acute or chronic renal failure.
# HTN: Hx of hypertension and propanolol use.
# Pain control: tylenol for now.
# Communication: [**Known lastname **],[**Name (NI) 539**] Wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76718**]  Medications on Admission: Lipitor 20mg daily Gabapentin 400mg daily (Headaches) Propranolol 160mg Daily Aricept 10mg [**Hospital1 **] Omeprazole ?
