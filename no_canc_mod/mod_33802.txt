Admission Date:  [**2182-4-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-4-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-1-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: Fever, lethargy, nausea, vomiting   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Spinal tap [**2182-4-13**]   History of Present Illness: No family available, Hx from chart review.
In ED, CT reportedly negative, "LP negative for infection", given Dilaudid 1mg IM, CTX 2 gram IV Q12, Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q12, Ampicillin 2 gram IV Q4, Doxycyclin 100 mg IV Q12, Acyclovir 600 mg (10 mg/kg) Q8, Dexamethasone 10 mg PO x 1, Zofran, Tylenol, dextrose D5W 200 cc Qshift, Zocor 10 QD.
Reportedly no sick contacts, no unusual exposures.
Imaging studies were performed (see below), ID was consulted, who recommended tx to [**Hospital1 18**] Neurosurgery since there was reportedly some hemorrhagic component on the MRI (read says bilateral T2 prolongation temporal lobes, BG, cerebellum - GRE* shows subtle hemorrhagic components R parietotemporal and parietal regions and in the L temporal lobe).
Neck stiffness but in all directions.
Pitch and speed of ranting increases with agitation.
Pertinent Results: TTE no vegetations  EEG This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and sleeping states due to sharp transient discharges in the bioccipital regions, particularly during drowsiness.
No electrographic seizure activity was noted.
A few interictal discharges were observed in the automatic spike detection files ( A few files showed generalized discharges with a left frontal predominance.
There were also some isolated left frontal epileptiform discharges observed ) No electrographic or clinical seizures were seen.
Mild pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion suggest mild cardiac decompensation or volume overload.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Repeat MRI [**4-18**]: There has been mild progression of lesions along the lateral aspect of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] as well as in the left putamen.
Essentially stable hyperintensity is seen in the bilateral right greater than left medial temporal lobes, bilateral caudate heads,pons, bilateral thalami, right caudate, right putamen and bilateral corona radiata.
A right frontal periventricular lesion is also enlarged slightly.
No avid enhancement is seen in these lesions.
There is faint enhancement in the right frontal periventricular lesion which has slightly increased in size.
Right parietal corona radiata and the left parietal corona radiata lesions also demonstrate faint enhancement.
IMPRESSION:  Mild interval progression of some lesions in the brain.
Differential includes viral encephalitis, fungal infection.
Given the acute symptoms, neoplasm is thought to be unlikely.
2nd repeat MRI [**4-23**]: No new lesions are seen compared to the most recent study of [**2182-4-18**].
Small lesions within the pons appear more discrete and a small lesion in the left centrum semiovale has decreased in size slightly.
Otherwise, lesions are largely unchanged in the periventricular right frontal lobe, right greater than left medial temporal lobes, bilateral caudate heads, bilateral putamen, bilateral thalami, and bilateral corona radiata.
Susceptibility dropout is again noted in many of these lesions as well.
There is minimal mucosal thickening in some ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: Overall, little change to multiple lesions in the brain; findings again may be consistent with ADEM.
EEG was done showing no PLEDS or triphasic waves, but some in [**Doctor Last Name 2434**] sharp transients in the occipital leads, not interpreted as epileptic but also not classic POSTs.
3 pushbutton events for increased HR and and bilateral arm shaking NOS had no EEG correlate suspect for seizure activity.
[**4-15**] VRE and MRSA x 2 pending.
No active issues.
Bloodpressures well controlled w/o medication.
PULM CXR negative for infiltration on [**4-13**].
No electrolyte abnormalities.
PPx Pneumoboots, bowel regimen, SC Heparin  EXAM ON TRANSFER TO FLOOR: Tm 97.8 63-81 RR 19-28 BP 100-117/50-65 NAD No diaphoresis Nuchal rigidity Cardiac S1S2 RRR no MGR Pulm CTA anteriorly Abdomen supple, NT/ND.
Mild fluctuations in the general level of arousal.
No new memory encoding - she could not remember who visited her the day prior, even if this was family or close friends.
[**Name (NI) **] neglect diminshed but clinically she continued to have a subtle L hemiparesis, best seen on pronator drift.
Repeat MRI formally showed no change but our own impression was a very mild improvement.
There was a discrete non-descript enhancement in some of the lesions, which does not have a clinical correlation.
She was continued on Prednisone, with a long and slow taper.
She will need follow-up closely after discharge from rehab with her PCP for continued monitoring, especially when coming off - watch for adrenal insufficiency and for relapse of her ADEM.
Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for perianal rash.
Zinc Oxide-Cod Liver Oil 40 % Ointment Sig: One (1)  Topical PRN (as needed) as needed for perianal rash.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM)   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You have been admitted with a diagnosis of acute disseminating encephalomyelitis, which is a post-infectious auto-immune reaction that affects your brain.
You will need intensive rehab, with an emphasis on cognition.
Please make sure you follow up with your doctor very closely since steroids have many potential side-effects.
Please report to the nearest ER or call 911 or your PCP immediately when you experience recurrence of weakness, numbness, tingling, problems with vision, speech, language, walking, thinking, headache, or difficulties arousing, or any other signs or symptoms of concern.
