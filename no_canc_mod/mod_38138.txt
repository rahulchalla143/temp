However from outside hospital reports, she arrived at the hospital with concerns of shortness of breath and an inhaler in her hand.
She then became unresponsive going into respiratory distress.
As she had a fever she was given 4.5 grams of zosyn, 1 gram of vancomycin, and fentanyl.
Upon arrival she continued to have intermittent episodes of jerking.

Note made of bilateral pleural effusions with underlying lung atelectasis.
A 2-cm cystic lesion, possibly arising from left ovary.
MRI of Brain:  Post-craniotomy changes in the frontal bone with focal encephalomalacia and right inferior frontal region.
She was initiated on broad spectrum anti-infective medications to cover for viral/bacterial forms of meningitis, treated with IV keppra for her seizures, and remained on continuous video EEG monitoring.
Her MRI showed postcraniotomy changes of the right frontal bone with underlying encephalomalacia, and her EEG did not show obvious seizure events.
Re: postcraniotomy changes, I am told by her PCP that she has a history of brain trauma and recent release from incarceration.
Ultimately, it was thought that her seizures were provoked and secondary to cocaine abuse (her UTOX was positive for cocaine metabolites).
Her acyclovir was continued until her HSV-PCR returned negative, although we had a low suspicion for a viral process to begin with.
I spoke with her NP[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 349**] and made her aware that a 2cm ovarian cyst was incidentally discovered on her L-spine MRI and likely can be followed up with either TVUS or abdominal CT/MRI.
Other cranial nerves are unremarkable; there is no facial droop, tongue is midline, sensation is grossly intact and her SCMs are symmetric.
