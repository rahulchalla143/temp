There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Mild fullness in the upper mediastinum with slight leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet is probably due to tortuous or enlarged head and neck vessels or right lobe of the thyroid.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
Diffuse emphysematous changes within the lungs with bilateral small pleural effusions.
Diffuse coronary artery and aortic calcifications.
Calcified fibroid uterus.
Hypo attenuating lesion in segment VII of the liver which is too small to characterize.
* [**2129-4-17**] ECG: Sinus bradycardia and atrial ectopy.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities, less prominent as compared to the previous tracing of [**2129-4-15**].
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 70-yo-woman w/ CAD, CHF, DM2, HTN, COPD on home O2, and schizophrenia s/p fall, admitted to the MICU w/ and somnolence.
Hypoxia/respiratory distress: This was thought to be copd exacerbation (The patient is on 4L O2 NC at home at rest.)
in the setting of a URI worsened by lack of O2 after fall and complicated by a CHF exacerbation given initial appearance of pulm edema on CXR.
She ruled out for an MI and interrogation of ICD showed no SVT or VT.  She was treated with a five daz course of azithromycin and a prednisone taper.
She had a nasal congestion which originally may have been secondary to her URI but was exacerbated by her self medication with Afrin nasal spray even after her medication was discontinued.
She developed these episodes of desaturation to 68% while on her nasal Bipap mask which was thought to be secondary to a central sleep apnea along with some question of her not being able to tolerate the nasal bipap mask secondary to her nasal congestion.
She was seen by pulmonary who recommended incresaing her nocturnal bipap for obstructive sleep apnea to 14/12 (from 14/8) and continuation of progresterone for respiratory stimulation.
She was seen by psychiatry while in the hospital who did not think that her somnolence was secondary to her medications.
No active issues during this hospitalization.
She ruled out for myocardial ischemia with serial negative cardiac enzymes.
CHF: She has CHF with an EF 40% secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy.
She was volume overloaded on admission and was succesfully diuresed.
ICD interrogation showed no arrhythmia.
We suspected that her unsteadiness might have been secondary to visual problems in dark - pinpoint pupils from psych meds preventing accomodation.
Her mental status cleared without focal neuro deficit.
UTI: U/A demonstrated small leukocyte esterase, WBcs and moderate bacteria.
DM type 2: Her glyburide was increased to 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] and she was started metformin 500 [**Hospital1 **] .
1.5 L fluid restriction.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease- on home O2 3.5L/m, BIPAP qhs(settings 14/8) -baseline pCO2 = 60-70 Obstructive sleep apnea Congestive Heart Failure Inability to void- requiring foley catherization Secondary 3.
