A tight proximal OM lesion was also visualized which was not intervened upon.
Ms. [**Known lastname 34191**] had some recurence of her chest pain which resolved with nicardipine.

She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: Vitals: Tm/Tc: 98.8/98.4 118-137/59-73 66-87 18 99(RA) FS: 298-266-298-222 GENERAL: obese spanish speaking only woman in no acute distress HEENT: PERRLA, no pharyngeal erythemia, mucous membs moist, no lymphadenopathy, JVD 2cm above clavicle CHEST: CTABL no wheezes, no rales, no rhonchi CV: S1 S2 Normal in quality and intensity RRR no murmurs rubs or gallops ABD: soft, non-tender, non-distended, BS normoactive.
EXT: wwp, no edema.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated single-vessel coronary artery disease with branch vessel disease in the LAD.
The LCx gave rise to an OM1 with a 90% stenosis at its origin and the circumflex was occluded in the mid vessel.
There was a 40% stenosis in the mid-RCA.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate central aortic  hypertension (169/88mmHg with a mean of 122mmHg).
Successful PTCA and stenting of mid Lcx with 2.5x23 and 2.5x15 (distal to proximal overlapping) Promus drug eluting stents postdilated with 2.75mm NC balloon.
Residual disease in OM1.
Consider PCI of OM ostial lesion in one month as oupatient.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral, and lateral walls.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity with mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.9 cm2 by planimetry).
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral, and lateral walls.
Rheumatic deformity of mitral valve leaflets with mild mitral stenosis and mild mitral regurgitation.

She is chest pain free with resolved STE after stenting.
Echo showed LVH and hypokinesis/akinesis of inferolateral/lateral walls, rheumatic deformity of MV leaflets, mild MS, mild MR.  She was discharged on Atorvastatin 80mg daily, ASA 325mg daily, Lisinopril 20mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily (will need for 1 year),  metoprolol succinate 25mg PO daily.
# DMII: Patient's DM is poorly-controlled with last HgbA1c of 12 in [**2153-10-9**].
# HLD: Discontinued home pravastatin, and started atorvastatin 80mg daily in light of recent MI.
