Multiple spine fractures, most pronounced at T4 and T5, where there is involvement of the vertebral bodies and narrowing of the central spinal canal.
Possible subtle L1 compression deformity versus normal variant.
There is a fracture through the mid humeral shaft.
There is displacement of fracture fragments by one half of the shaft diameter, and there is also mild angulation.
C5 right pedicle, C6 right lamina, C7 left transverse process, and left 2nd rib fractures.
Multiple thoracic spine fractures, most pronounced at T4 and T5 where there is resultant kyphotic angulation and narrowing of the central canal.
Right scapular and multiple rib fractures.
Bilateral lung contusions, and small right pneumothorax.
Small fluid in [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch, etiology unclear.
Left temporal and parietal nondisplaced fractures with small underlying epidural hematomas, and possibly minimal subdural hemorrhage.
Right frontal hemorrhagic contusions.
MRI C/T/L Spine:[**9-5**] C-SPINE No evidence of cervical spine malalignment or cervical cord impingement.
THORACIC SPINE There is abnormally increased T2 signal throughout the T2, T3, T4, and T5 vertebrae, and in the superior endplates of T6 and T7.
There may also be slightly increased signal within T1 and C7 on the inversion recovery images.
There is a compression fracture of T4 with retropulsed fragments producing moderate spinal canal narrowing.
There is also a focus of heterogeneous signal abnormality within the spinal cord at the T4 level, which probably represents a contusion.
There is edema in the prevertebral soft tissues of the upper thoracic spine.
There is also edema throughout the posterior vasculature.
Abnormal signal is evident within the lungs as well, consistent with the presence of pulmonary contusions.
LS-SPINE No evidence of lumbosacral malalignment, compression of the vertebrae, or neural impingement.
Stable size of left extraaxial hemorrhage.
No new hemorrhage identified.
Mastoid and paranasal sinus opacification.
Left median motor conduction study recording abductor pollicis brevis had a markedly reduced amplitude and moderately reduced conduction velocity and mildly prolonged latency; F responses were normal.
Left ulnar motor conduction study had a moderately reduced amplitude (as compared to the right side) and normal conduction velocities; F responses were normal.
Left median and ulnar motor conduction studies recording 2nd lumbrical and first palmar interosseous respectively revealed normal minimal prolongation of latency in both nerves.
Left median sensory repsonse had a markedly reduced amplitude with normal conduction velocity.
Left medial and lateral antebrachial cutaneous sensory responses were unobtainable.
Needle examination of selected muscles of the left upper extremities representing the C5-T1 myotomes revealed ongoing denervation in multiple muscles, including those innervated by the median and ulnar nerves, as well as the musculocutaneous nerve.
However, radially innervated muscles appeared to be generally well preserved with only occasional fibrillation potentials in brachioradialis.
Needle examination of the cervical paraspinal muscles could not be performed as the patient was in a hard collar.
IMPRESSION:  Complex, abnormal study.
The electrophysiologic findings are most consistent with a subacute, severe diffuse left brachial plexopathy with relative sparing of the posterior cord.
Repeat study after the cervical collar is removed may provide additional diagnostic information regarding the possible contribution of cervical nerve root injury.
HD#2 - Hematocrit dropped from 35 to 24, transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units fresh fozen plasma for coagulopathy with INR=1.5.
Underwent open reduction, internal fixation of leftmidshaft humerus fracture with plating.
HD#4 - Had inferior vena cava filter placement by vascular surgery.
Had increased glucose and an insulin drip was started.
Chest tube was placed on water seal and then pulled when repeat CXR demonstrated no pneumothorax.
Tube feeds were held for increased residual.
Went to operating room with neurosurgery for open reduction of T4-5 fracture dislocation, T2-T3 posterior thoracic arthrodesis utilizing locally harvested vertebral autograft supplemented with Vitoss foam and infuse bone morphogenetic protein, and a T2-T8 posterior segmental spinal instrumentation utilizing the [**Location (un) **] spinal fixation system.
HD#7 - Required fluid boluses for decreased CVP and urine output.
HD#9 - Post pyloric Dobbhoff placed.
Repeat head CT demonstrated increased epidural hematoma.
HD#11 -  Spiked to 101.7 and CXR has new L basilar infiltrate.
R antecubital midline PICC line placed.
Continuing to treat enteroclocae and H. flu RLL pneumonia.
Chronic pain service believes pain c/w neuropathic pain.
Psychiatry did not believe patient was in a depressive state requiring pharmacotherapy.
Left upper extremity pain worsening.
Neurontin titrated up per chronic pain service's recommendations.
HD #22 - Spiked fever overnight to 101.7.
UA was negative, WBC not increased, CXR shows improved opacities at right lung base, but worsening retrocardiac density.
Incisions all c/d/i, no decubiti.
Fever still believed to be respiratory in origin.
Left hand pain also continues.
HD #23-24 - Patient now with only low grade temperatures.
All cultures including blood culture and central line tip continue to have no growth.
Neurology consulted for left hand pain and patient received EMG/NCS.
Patient has aberrant conducton in multiple nerves, locatin of lesion unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] believed to have either a brachial plexopathy or multiple mononeuropathies, predominantly median nerve.
There was no evidence of a depressive disorder.
It is important to note, however, that weight bearing in his left upper extremitiy might be limited by a brachial plexopathy.
Strength in his left upper extremity is most likely limited by both pain and a possible brachial plexopathy or multiple mononeuropathies as noted above.
He is able to maintain seated balance with bilateral upeper extremity support.
He also has a resolving pneumonia and will receive his 14th and last dose of levofloxacin tommorrow.
The pneumothorax on initial presntation has also resolved on most recent chest x-ray.
Right lower lobe atelectasis had also improved, however, there was some woresing left lower lobe consolidation.
NO MIXED consistencies.
* In terms of prophylaxsis he continues to be on pneumoboots and receiving both subcutaneous heparin and zantac.
* In terms of neurologic issues, the neuropathic pain in his left hand has been assessed by both neurology and the chronic pain service.
The chronic pain service comments that he has allodynia of his left palm and fingertips.
He reported a 50-70% relief of pain with intial local anesthesia and increased motor strength in his hand.
The chronic pain service recommends 800mg TID of neruontin, nortryptiline QHS, and Roxicet PRN.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] most recent CT scan from [**2162-9-19**] showed the following:  epidural hematoma in the left middle fossa, essentially stable since the previous exam.
No new intracranial hemorrhage is seen.
There is no mass effect, shift of the normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.
Again seen are multiple low density areas in the frontal and temporal lobes on the right due to contusions.
* In terms of ID issues, pt had fever last week without localizing symptoms or leukocytosis.
Extensive fever work-up included blood culture, urine cultures, picc line tip culture, chest x-ray, humerus/hardware x-ray & T/L-spine CT to evaluate for abcess or osteomyelitis.
ID was consulted, doubted drug or central fever as etiology.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for as needed for lack of bowel movements.
