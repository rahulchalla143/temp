HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 53572**] #1 is a preterm infant with respiratory distress admitted to the NICU for management.
Mother was admitted at 24 weeks for cervical shortening and treated with betamethasone.
She was followed by serial monitoring, and the decision was made to deliver because of progressive preeclampsia.
Initial physical exam remarkable for preterm infant in moderate respiratory distress with pink color, soft anterior fontanelle, normal facies, intact palate, moderate retractions, fair air entry, no murmur, present femoral pulses, flat, soft, nontender abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly, normal phallus, testes in canal, stable hips, normal perfusion, normal tone and activity for gestational age.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: Respiratory:  [**Known lastname **] was initially in moderate respiratory distress and was intubated and received three doses of Surfactant.
Because of continued difficulties in ventilating, he was switched to high frequency oscillatory ventilation and remained on this mode of ventilation until day of life seven at which time he was successfully transitioned to conventional ventilation.
Since extubation, he is maintained on caffeine for apnea of prematurity, which has been fairly mild from [**1-2**] apneic and bradycardic episodes per day.
He was diagnosed clinically with a patent ductus arteriosus.
He continues to have an intermittent soft cardiac murmur, but without clinical evidence of patent ductus arteriosus.
He has no other cardiovascular issues.
He was started on enteral feeds on day of life 10, and advanced without difficulty to his current intake of 150 cc/kg/day of mother's milk or premature Enfamil supplemented to 30 kilocalories/ounce with ProMod by gavage feeding.
He also received supplemental vitamin E and ferrous sulfate.
[**Known lastname **] appears to have some mild spittiness, but has not required treatment with Reglan or Zantac.
Infectious disease:  [**Known lastname **] was initially on a 48 hour sepsis evaluation for prematurity and respiratory distress, and sepsis evaluation was extended to 72 hours because of his initial significant respiratory distress.
He had another negative sepsis evaluation on Vancomycin and gentamicin from day of life seven to eight, initiated for increased respiratory distress and reopening of his patent ductus arteriosus.
He has not had another active infectious disease issues.
Neurology:  When [**Known lastname **] was on high frequency oscillatory ventilation, he required two doses of phenobarbital in his first several days of life, as well as intermittent Fentanyl prn to maintain sedation for the high frequency oscillatory ventilation.
Sensory:  [**Known lastname **] has not yet had his first hearing screen or first ophthalmologic examination.
A repeat sent on [**10-11**] showed mildly low levels of thyroxin, but a repeat screen on [**10-17**] was also not acceptable.
Prematurity at 28-5/7 weeks gestational age.
Status post respiratory distress syndrome.
Apnea of prematurity.
