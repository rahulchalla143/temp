HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 33-year-old woman with no significant past medical history who was admitted for dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure likely from postpartum state.
The patient's medication was occasionally held due to low blood pressure.
The goal digoxin level for the patient will likely be between 1.5 and 2.0 nanograms for inotropic effect.
The procedure was without complications.
This was placed given her significant cardiomyopathy as potential for arrhythmia.
The patient was also started on low-dose Lasix given her recurrent ascites and pulmonary edema.
The patient also developed a hematoma at the original ICD site and anticoagulation was held until the hematoma improved.
At that point, anticoagulation can resume for her risk of thrombus given her low ejection fraction.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was noted to have a right lower lobe effusion with a possible infiltrate and was given a seven day course of levofloxacin for questionable pneumonia.
The patient's chest x-ray resolved over a period of a week and she had improvement in her lung volumes and decrease in her pleural effusions bilaterally.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient was noted to be slightly hypothyroid and was started on low-dose Levoxyl 25 micrograms and needs to have an outpatient TSH level rechecked in approximately two to three weeks.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had occasional constipation and intermittent abdominal pain.
The abdominal pain was thought most likely secondary to both a small amount of ascites and gas pain.
Serial KUBs were done which were all negative for signs of obstruction.
She was given an aggressive bowel regimen which helped improve her symptoms and also put on p.o.
intake most of her hospital stay felt secondary to poor appetite.
DISCHARGE STATUS: Stable, able to tolerate some exercise with no chest pain, no rest shortness of breath.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to postpartum state.
