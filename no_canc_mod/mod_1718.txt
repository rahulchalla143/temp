Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2118-11-16**] Laparoscopic loop ileostomy [**2118-12-6**] Hemorrhoid banding [**2118-12-26**] Exploratory laparotomy, takedown of loop ileostomy, small bowel resection, creation of end ileostomy and mucous fistula.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a previous medical history significant for Crohn's disease.
She presently has evidence of a stricture in the distal terminal ileum, and because of that, the patient recently underwent laparoscopic creation of a diverting loop ileostomy.
It should be added that the patient had this more conservative surgical treatment rather than a cecal resection because of poor heart condition and severe COPD, both of which were considered contraindications for more extensive surgical procedures.
The ileostomy was created approximately 1 month ago, and since then the patient has been doing well up until yesterday when the ileostomy output suddenly stopped and the patient developed significant abdominal pain.
Initial imaging studies with KUB and CT scan were consistent with small bowel obstruction close to the ileostomy, and there was some concern whether the patient had intraluminal content that created a mechanical obstruction.
The KUB and CT scan did not show any evidence of free air.
The patient was initially managed with a nasogastric tube and a Foley was also placed in the afferent loop of the ileostomy yielding large amount of small bowel content, whereafter the abdomen became less a tender and distended.
Today, however, the abdominal pain has continued and worsened, and her abdominal exam has also worsened and we are concerned of  peritonitis why the patient now was taken to the operating room for exploration.

She was initially admitted to the ICU [**Date range (3) 12812**] for hypotension, and was later transferred to the medical floor.
She had an SBO that was attributed to a stricture in the mid/distal ileum that had superimposed inflammation.
The patient also had significant edema in her legs, arms, and breast--more prominently on the left side.
Diuresis given with small dose Lasix with good effect and not resulting in hypotension.
Post-op, the patient was transferred back to the ICU for management of post-op hypotension.
She continued to have significant edema that was causing her great discomfort.
Lasix was restarted at the same dose as was used pre-op to attempt to reduce the edema that was still present in her legs, arms, and breast--more so on the left side.
TTE was not conclusive in ruling out valve vegetation, so TEE was performed which revealed vegetations on her ICD lead.
Given the clearance of blood cultures, lack of fevers or significant leukocytosis the patient was treated conservatively as removal of her lead would be difficult given that it is an ICD lead and that it is several years old and may would require a thoracotomy (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Small Bowel Obstruction [**1-11**] acute on chronic Crohn's flare: Medically treated at first but given recurrence a diverting loop ileostomy was performed.
There was no bleeding into the ostomy bag.
Given concern that Mesalamine was contributing to her renal failure this was also discontinued.
Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: As her blood pressures improved her beta blocker was up titrated up and she was started on digoxin with a load of 0.5mg daily x 2 days then on digoxin 125mcg daily.
Her Digoxin level remained wnl at 0.6-0.7 despite the occurrence of renal failure.
Anasarca and asymmetric breast edema: Related to steroid use in the setting of systolic congestive heart failure with an EF of 30%.
L breast swelling was evaluated with Mammogram and ultrasound and found to be subcutaneous edema without other underlying pathology.
She was seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] MD from breast surgery and he diagnosed her with truncal lymphedema related to total body fluid overload and stated the recovery is a slow process but it should recovery with tapering of steroids and diuresis.
Depression/Anxiety: Psychiatry was consulted as the depression and anxiety became overwhelming and the patient was unable to participate in her care.
Acute Renal Failure, Acute Tubular Necrosis Thought to be due to Gentamycin toxicity vs. salicylate toxicity.
Renal function slowly improved with discontinuation of Gentamycin and Mesalamine, and then plateaued at 1.7 prior to discharge, thought to be secondary to mild dehydration for which she was encouraged to increase her PO intake.
She was also started on Imodium and banana flakes to decrease fluid losses through her ostomy.
Surgical team explained this occurrence and significance to the family.On [**2118-12-25**] had increase abdominal pain, decrease stoma output.
However she continued to have abdominal pain with peritoneal signs and leukocytosis 20 K. On [**2118-12-26**] patient was taken emergently to the operating room and was found to have a perforation of small bowel at the site of the ileostomy with purulent peritonitis.
She underwent a takedown of her loop ileostomy, small bowel resection and creation of end ileostomy and mucous fistula.
Cardiology were consulted and metoprolol dose was increased and recommended no digoxin.
Overnight developed paranoia, antidepressants were restarted on [**2118-12-30**].
She had immediate return of bowel function after surgery, the stoma is pink and protruding with liquid stool.
Left mucous fistula with scant drainage.
Ms. [**Known lastname 12811**] complains of intermittent abdominal pain which increases with movement, she has been encouraged to take her oral analgesia as needed.
POD 9 she had approx 50 cc of blood from rectum, a stat hematocrit was drawn,35.2 and had no further episodes and is stable for transfer to rehabilitation center.

You also suffered an infection of your blood stream which may have caused an infection of your implanted defibrillator lead and you are being treated with an extended course of antibiotics.
A complication of your antibiotics and Crohn's treatment is transient renal failure.
