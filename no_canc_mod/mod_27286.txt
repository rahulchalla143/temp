Traumatic grade II anterolisthesis of C6 on C7 with right inferior C6 facet fracture and locking of the C6-7 facets.
There is likely moderate-to-severe cord compression and associated epidural hematoma.
Prominent posterior soft tissue stranding and numerous osseous fragments are observed posterior to the spinous processes.
A hazy area of increased attenuation is observed in the medial right frontal lobe.
There is no hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or major vascular territorial infarction.
A small subgaleal hematoma is noted over the posterior vertex.
MRI of  C-SPINE:[**2192-2-11**] Subluxation of C6 over C7 with appearances suggestive of a flexion injury and disruption of the posterior longitudinal, interspinous and anterior longitudinal ligaments and anterior subluxation of C6 over C7.
Moderate spinal canal stenosis and indentation on the spinal cord at this level with a small posterior epidural hematoma measuring approximately 1 cm.
The right facet joint is dislocated and locked and the left facet joint is perched as described on the CT. No increased signal seen within the spinal cord.
Degenerative changes at other levels.
BILAT LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER STUDY;[**2192-2-13**] Evidence of chronic prior DVT on right leg.
No acute DVT.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color  Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal  cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis  is not present.

MR CERVICAL SPINE; MR THORACIC SPINE;LUMBAR SPINE [**2192-2-18**] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 84 year old man with s/p cervical fusion, decreased lower extremity movement  TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial images of the cervical and thoracic spine were acquired.
There is increased signal seen within the disc at C6-7 level indicating previous trauma at this level.
There is no intraspinal fluid collection identified.
There is no subdural hematoma or spinal cord compression seen in the cervical region.
From skull base to C6 level, no increased signal seen within the spinal cord.
However, at C6-7 and inferiorly to T2 level, there is increased signal seen within the central portion of the spinal cord which could be secondary to cord edema or ischemic changes within the cord.
No evidence of abnormal signal seen within the thoracic cord below T2 level.
There is no evidence of intraspinal hematoma seen.
Increased signal is seen within the spinal cord from C6-7 to T2 level indicative of cord edema or ischemia within the cord.
Degenerative changes are seen at multiple levels in the cervical and thoracic region.
No evidence of intraspinal fluid collection or extrinsic spinal cord compression is seen.
Multilevel degenerative changes.
Mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis at L4-5 level secondary to disc bulging, central protrusion and facet degenerative changes.
At that time, chest and pelvis X-rays were negative fro fractures, although he did have a tiny right upper lobe nodule that should be followed up in one year.
Hand X-rays were negative for fracture.
A CT of his C-spine revealed a traumatic grade II anterolisthesis of C6 on C7 with a right inferior C6 facet fracture and locking of the C6-7 facets.
In addition, there was evidence of moderate-to-severe cord compression and associated epidural hematoma.
There were also prominent posterior soft tissue stranding and numerous osseous fragments posterior to the spinous processes, which worrisome for associated ligamentous injury.
A CT of his head demonstrated a hazy area of increased attenuation along the medial right frontal lobe, which was unclear whether it was secondary to previously administered IV contrast or a small amount of subarachnoid blood.
Since he had been on coumadin for a previous DVT (INR 1.6), he had to be corrected with 2 units of FFP and vitamin K.  On HD 2, a repeat head CT showed a small focus of hyperdensity along the medial border of the right frontal lobe concerning for an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, as well as a small (4mm width) subdural fluid collection concerning for a small subdural effusion.
An MRI of his spine showed a subluxation of C6 over C7 with appearances suggestive of a flexion injury and disruption of the posterior longitudinal, interspinous and anterior longitudinal ligaments and anterior subluxation of C6 over C7.
There was also evidence of moderate spinal canal stenosis and indentation on the spinal cord at this level with a small posterior epidural hematoma measuring approximately 1 cm.
He was taken to the OR where he had a posterior cervical laminectomy with fusion of C4-C7 and evacuation of an epidural hematoma by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14354**] [**Name (STitle) **].
The operation went well with no complications (please see operative note for details), however he did require an emergent tracheostomy for a difficult intubation by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6633**].
Intraoperative X-rays demonstrated posterior spinal rods and pedicle screws within the C5, C6, and C7 vertebral bodies.
A postoperative chest X-ray demonstrated findings consistent with CHF and fluid overload.
He had no gag or corneal reflex.
He was also on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
He also had an elevated troponin to 0.29, then 0.37, which was though to be due to renal failure (createnine 1.9 from 1.4), although his EKG was significant for ST depressions in V3-V6, II and AVF.
A CT of his abdomen and pelvis was done because of his acidosis and showed extensive consolidation of both lower lung zones, with airspace opacities in the right middle lobe, suggestive of aspiration or aspiration pneumonia, small bilateral pleural effusions, diverticulosis without diverticulitis, and small atrophic kidneys.
A CT of his C-spine showed a nondisplaced fracture, probably from hyperextension, of anterior inferior portion of T2 vertebral body; this may involve a tiny portion of the middle column, and therefore may be an unstable fracture.
It also showed slight retrolisthesis of C6 on C7 and slight anterolisthesis of C7 on T1, much improved since last exam (both now grade 1).
A CT of his head showed no significant change.
Cardiology was consulted due to his elevated troponins and they recommended aspirin (when stable), B-blockers to keep the HR at 60, and an echocardiogram.
A repeat head CT showed interval enlargement of bilateral frontal subdural hygromas, which were not present on the initial CT of [**2192-2-10**].
It also showed a persistent filiform hyperdensity at the medial aspect of the right frontal lobe, unchanged since the prior study (diagnostic possibilities include subarachnoid hemorrhage versus vascular calcification).
Lower extremity ultrasounds revealed no evidence of acute DVT.
On POD 3, he was no longer acidotic (pH 7.42).
He had good biceps and shoulder shrug, but no triceps or grip strength.
His WBC climbed from 12.4 to 15.9 and he had a temperature of 100, so he was started on Vancomycin and Levaquin for pneumonia.
A swallow evaluation was done, which he failed due to discoordinated swallow.
The operation went well with no complications.
A repeat spinal MRI was done- there was no evidence of intraspinal fluid collection or extrinsic spinal cord compression, with mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis at L4-5 level secondary to disc bulging and increased signal within the spinal cord from C6-7 to T2 level indicative of cord edema or ischemia within the cord.
Tube feeds were restarted but held overnight due to increased residuals.
On POD 8, a SOMI brace was ordered because we assumed that his T2 fracture seen on MRI was unstablesince he was having some lower extremity weakness.
A medicine consult was called due to his generalized edema and dyspnea.
Free water was added to his tube feeds due to hypernatremia.
We doubted that he had a new cardiac event since his previous elevations.
He required some suctioning for thick yellow secretions.
On POD 12, his chest X-ray showed decreased CHF.
On [**2192-2-26**] patient had a emesis about 1000ml, hemaoccult was positive, however occult blood in stool was negative on rectral exam.
His tube feeds restarted slowly (@10ml/hr to goal of 85 ml/hr)on [**2-28**], no more emesis noted since the event, and LFT's has been slowly trending down.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a [**Known lastname **]) as needed for thrush.
Morphine 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: [**12-19**]  Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for breakthrough pain.
