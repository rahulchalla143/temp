He is avid walker and has noticed this discomfort when going up any type of incline and resolving with rest.
He underwent a stress echo which revealed mild LV enlargement with preserved LV function.
There was moderate mitral valve prolapse involving the posterior leaflet with severe mitral insuffiency and pulmonary vein flow reversal.
Mild TR and borderline aortic root dilation were seen.
He exercised 6 minutes and developed chest pain at peak exercise along with lateral ST depression.
Echo imaging showed anteroseptal ischemia.
He was found to have coronary artery disease upon cardiac catheterization and referred to cardiac surgery.
He continued to complain of chest pain on a nitro drip and morphine.
Past Medical History: Mitral prolapse/regurgitation Mild hyperlipidemia, recently started on statin Non sustained VT 13 years ago, on Atenolol since Hemorrhoids with occasional rectal bleeding Bone spurs s/p surgery Remote history of migraines   Social History: Race:caucasian Last Dental Exam: Lives with:Wife and three kids Contact:[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1024**] (Wife)  #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 92294**] Occupation:works at a bank as a temporary worker doing booking Cigarettes: Smoked no [] yes [x] Hx:occasional cigarette/cigar (none in 2 months) Other Tobacco use:denies ETOH: 2 glasses of wine per day Illicit drug use:denies   Family History: Adopted.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the RA or RAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Moderately dilated LV cavity.
AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
No atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Partial mitral leaflet flail.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The descending aorta appears free from atherosclerotic plaque with some limitation in the study due to the presence of an intraaortic balloon pump.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate/severe posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
There is partial posterior (P2) mitral leaflet flail.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POSTBYPASS: The patient is in sinus tachycardia on low dose epinephrine & moderate dose phenylephrine infusions.
The aorta appears intact, though the descending aorta has suboptimal imaging due to the presence of an IABP.
The patient developed severe angina after his diagnostic cardiac cath which revealed moderate left main disease and high-grade LAD and diagonal stenoses.
A stat echo in the Operating Room showed severe mitral regurgitation.
The patient had a stable night and did not rule in for a myocardial infarction by serial enzyme analysis.
The operation went without complication and the patient was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition.
Chest tubes were removed per cardiac surgery protocol and follow up CXR showed no pneumothorax.
Pacing wires were removed on POD3 per cardiac surgery protocol without difficulty.
He was changed from Percocet to Ultram due to confusion and lethargy.
He was kept an extra day due to unsteadiness with ambulation.
There was  a tiny amount of serosanguinous drainage on the sternal dressing the morning of discharge, however, the sternum was stable, no further drainage could be expressed and he was afebrile with a normal white blood cell count.
