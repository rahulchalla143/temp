Admission Date:  [**2182-9-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2182-9-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-9-29**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old gentleman who has a several month history of shortness of breath which has been improved over the last month.
The patient was undergoing a preoperative evaluation for a right total knee replacement and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation in [**2182-5-12**] with severe CHF and moderate mitral regurgitation by echocardiogram.
The patient was admitted to the hospital for cardiac catheterization which showed an ejection fraction of 55%, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, LVEDP of 24, a 50% LAD lesion and a 90% circumflex lesion.
The patient was originally scheduled for mitral valve replacement and CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in [**2182-7-12**]; however, the patient was found to have moderate to large size rectal masses on physical examination.
Atrial fibrillation.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
TIA in [**2180**] without residual.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The patient underwent carotid ultrasound preoperatively which were without flow-limiting stenosis.
The patient also underwent a ligation and stapling of the left atrial appendage.
In the Operating Room, the patient's mitral valve was found to have changes consistent with active endocarditis which was an unexpected finding.
The valve was sent for culture.
On initial Gram's stain, the valve showed 2+ gram-positive rods and 2+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
The subsequent valve culture grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.
Postoperatively, the patient arrived from the Operating Room in rapid atrial fibrillation with rates in the 120s-150s.
The patient remained afebrile postoperatively and the patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the floor on postoperative day number two.
The patient had significant bilateral knee varus with difficulty ambulating.
On chest x-ray, it was noted that the patient had elevated left hemidiaphragm with left lower lobe atelectasis.
On postoperative day number six, the patient began complaining of some right-sided pleuritic chest pain.
The chest x-ray at that time showed no infiltrate and no effusion on the right side.
We were unable to medicate the patient with any NSAIDs due to the patient's renal insufficiency.
However, on the morning of postoperative day number seven, the patient had some nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed an ejection fraction of 40% without any significant changes in wall motion abnormality.
It was recommended that the patient be continued on an increased dose of his beta blocker and no other antiarrhythmic therapy or implantable cardiac defibrillator would be recommended.
However, it was recommended that the patient be started on Coumadin for his history of atrial fibrillation and this was started on postoperative day number seven.
On postoperative day number eight, the patient continued to have right-sided pleuritic chest pain which improved with pain medication, reproducible with inspiration.
The chest x-ray again showed no infiltrate or effusion.
Coronary artery disease.
Intraoperative findings of mitral valve endocarditis with subsequent coagulase-negative Staphylococcus on culture.
Status post PICC placement for long-term antibiotics.
Perioperative atrial fibrillation.
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
Lungs:  There was scattered rhonchi at the bilateral bases, decreased left base greater than right.
Chest x-ray on [**2182-9-18**] showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm, mild bilateral atelectasis, otherwise unchanged from previous chest x-rays.
