Radiographic lucency corresponds to colon interposed between the liver and diaphragm.
Fluid-filled cecum and ascending colon is compatible with history of diarrhea.
Scattered diverticula without diverticulitis.
There is no [**Month/Day/Year 1902**], focal infiltrate, or effusion.
Minimal atelectasis at both bases.
Linear calcification overlying the right lung apex likely represents vascular calcification.
No free air is seen beneath the diaphragm.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process identified.
ECG [**2119-7-2**]: Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions.
Compared to the previous tracing no diagnostic interim change.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2119-7-3**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferior, inferolateral and inferoseptal segments.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen; it is likely ischemic in nature.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2112-3-23**], regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is new.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2119-7-5**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal-mid inferior and inferolateral walls.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

DIFFICILE TOXIN [**2119-7-3**] - negative  Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old woman with a history of hypertension, stage III CKD, and COPD is admitted for nausea/vomiting and found to have NSTEMI with hypoxia and tachycardia requiring admission to the CCU.
Repeat EKG showed resolution of previously seen STD and new PR depressions in II, III and aVF, which can be seen in RV infarct.
Her initial N/V may have been related to myocardial ischemia.
Echo showed evidence of mild LV dysfunction (EF 40-45%) c/w CAD, moderate mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac catheterization was deferred given respiratory distress likely secondary to heart failure and/or pneumonia, as well as the fact that she had persistent tachycardia equivalent to a stress test which she tolerated without recurrence of symptoms.
Simvastatin was changed to atorvastatin at 80 mg, aspirin and plavix were started to minimize coronary artery thrombus.
#Hypoxia - On arrival to CCU, CXR showed evidence of worsening pulmonary edema since admission after receiving fluids.
Pt with labored breathing and pursed lips.
Hypoxia thought to be due to volume overload as result of NSTEMI vs COPD exacerbation.
Repeat CXR concerning for early infiltrate vs. aspiration pnuemonia.
Given recent hospitalization, fever, and elevated white count coverage for HAP was also initiated with vanc/cefepime and azithromycin for atypical coverage.
Pulmonary service was consulted and recommended further diuresis and to stop the steroids as they felt SOB was more likely due to combination of UTI, lung inflammation/aspiration pneumonia, and/or low EF and MR [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1902**]/ACS.
At the time of discharge, she was comfortable on RA and denied cough or sputum production.
She was not discharged on diuretics because of her [**Last Name (un) **], but this may be considered in the future if she has evidence of fluid retention.
#Tachycardia: Likely multifactorial and related to hypovolemia agitation from respiratory distress, and possibly depressed LVEF.
Patient remained tachycardic in the 120s.
Pt did have short episode of Afib, and converted with ibutilide.
She remained tachycardic in low 100s throughout admission despite euvolemic, adequate pain control, no O2 requirements.
Metoprolol sucinate was uptitrated to 150 mg [**Hospital1 **]  #Afib: Pt had episode of Afib on [**7-4**] treated with ibutilide 1 mg x 1 and converted to sinus.
Given a drop in HCT and guaiac positive stools, anticoaguluation was discontinued.
#UTI: Pt had urine culture showing > 100,000 org/ML of enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin, which she was already receiving for aspiration PNA.
#Hypertension: Patient admitted with SBP 130's, and  became hypotensive in the setting of tachycardia and NSTEMI.
#Hyperglycemia - Initial chemistry significant for glucose of 222. patient is without history of diabetes, possibly stress response to acute myocardial infarction.
Also may have been elevated from steroid use.
#Nausea/vomiting - Pt was initially started on Cipro/Flagyl when admitted to the floor given n/v/d and recent history of infectious colitis.
#Pt had episodes of Afib on admission.
However, did not start Coumadin at this time given that patient had drop in HCT and guaic positive stools.

Discharge Instructions: You had trouble breathing and a low oxygen level that was due to a heart attack.
At the same time, you have a pneunomia for which you received one week of antibiotics.
You now do not need any oxygen and have no fever or other signs of infection.
You were in an irregular rhythm called atrial fibrillation and are now in a normal rhythm again.
We started warfarin (coumadin) but you developed some blood in your stool and this was stopped.
Until your heart recovers from the heart attack, weigh yourself every morning before breakfast and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
Start tylenol as needed for pain 6.
This could cause a rapid heart rate.
