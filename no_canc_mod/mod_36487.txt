[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 26225**], yesterday with complaints of right leg discomfort, and swelling of his right leg.
He was called and asked to come back as he was noted to have some CHF but declined.
Late in the afternoon he was finally convinced to be admitted with a diagnosis of shortness of breath/CHF.
He reportedly had vague complaints of chest discomfort on the right, and somewhat on the left, a variable cough, vague chills but no fever and was noted to be short of breath especially with inclines, stairs, and exertion.
At baseline he can walk up two flights of stairs, but over the last week he has had decreasing exercise tolerance and now   No orthopnea or PND.
He was admitted, diuresed, and underwent an echocardiogram which showed severe aortic regurgitation and aortic deformity.

The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a moderate vegetation on the tricuspid valve.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
CXR: [**10-16**] - No previous images.
The cardiac silhouette is enlarged though there is no evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
Probable small pleural effusions bilaterally with extension into the major fissure on the right.
Bibasilar atelectatic change without definite focal pneumonia.
No pneumothorax or any other placement-related complication is identified.
The pulmonary vasculature does not demonstrate any remaining congested pattern and no new acute infiltrates are seen.
Bilateral pleural effusions, with associated atelectasis and consolidation of the lung bases.
Tiny rounded hypodensities in bilateral kidneys, too small to  characterize.
No evidence for parenchymal infarcts within the abdomen.
Complete loss of disc height at L1-2, with irregular endplate sclerosis.
While this is most likely secondary to severe degenerative disease, correlate with any symptoms referrable to the lower lumbar spine, as infection may have a similar appearance in the appropriate clinical context.
Mild brain atrophy without hemorrhage on head CT. 2.
No evidence of an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size on CT angiography of the head.
It should be noted that mycotic aneurysm in the peripheral branches of the intracranial arteries could not be excluded by CT angiography.
Carotid US [**10-19**]: No hemodynamically significant stenosis within the right or left internal carotid arteries.
No acute fracture detected.
Prepatellar soft tissue edema.
Cardiac Cath [**10-19**]: No coronary disease   Brief Hospital Course: 69 M with HTN, hyperlipidemia, IPF, Hep C, and psoriatic arthritis presenting with bacterial endocarditis and CHF exacerbation.
BACTERIAL ENDOCARDITIS - On presenation pt had a transesophageal echo showing tricuspid and aortic vegetations and severe aortic insufficiency.
History of nightsweats for months and progressive dyspnea argued against acute endocarditis, as does appearence of vegitations and regurgitation on multiple valves.
Given his heart failure in the setting of endocarditis he was evaluated by cardiac surgery for emergent valve replacement who deferred surgery until after antibiotic course as pt was hemodynamically stable.
Pt was cleared for surgery with multiple pre-op screening tests including normal carotid ultrasound, head CT, cardiac cath and dental eval with panorex.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE - Pt was initially agressively diuresed at OSH in the setting of infection and contrast and on presentation was given 20mg IV Lasix daily with slow diuresis.
ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS - Pt initially had some RLQ tenderness and h/o BRBPR, so CT scan was done to look for possible source of bacteremia.
There was no suggested source of infection seen and pt's symptoms spontaneously resolved.
Pt had no changes in his bowel habits thoughout the admission.
INTERSTITIAL PULMONARY FIBROSIS - Normal PFTs in [**2171**] and not on O2 at home.
Was not thought to be the etiology of his initial hypoxia and pt had normal room air sats after initial diuresis.
[**Name (NI) 109664**] - Pt developed worsening right knee pain during his hospital stay.
He was evaluated with an x-ray showing effusion, osteoarthritis and chondrocalcinosis.
He also was tapped by the rheumatology team and synovial fluid confirmed diagnosis of pseudogout.
In order to avoid NSAIDs or cholchicine to protect the renal function, pt had a steroid injection by rheumatology which pt tolerated well and gave pt complete relief.
PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS - Pt's pain was controlled with tylenol .
PSYCH: Pt has anxiety and baseline depression but coped well thoughout the admission.
Heparin Lock Flush (Porcine) 10 unit/mL Solution Sig: Two (2) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
