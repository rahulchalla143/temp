oriented x3 but gets confused when relating HPI.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, some bleeding from left lateral aspect of the tongue, appears to be dried blood.
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: tachycardic, irregularly irregular, rormal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: no focal defects, 4/5 strength throughout although diffusely weak he is able to resist forces  ON DISCHARGE: 98.2, 68, 117/84, 18, 99 RA.
Telemetry review: sinus rhythm, usually 60-80s, with some spikes to 100-110s (sinus) Gen- alert, well appearing, NAD Psych- still insight and judgement appear limited, does not consistently endorse alcohol as a problem, but is more agreeable to alcohol treatment programs.
Skin- ecchymosis noted around R forehead/periorbital region, stable CV- RRR no m/g Lung- CTAB Abd- soft nontender  Pertinent Results: Head CT IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a small right frontal subgaleal hematoma.
CXR [**2164-5-19**] FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates normal cardiomediastinal silhouette allowing for AP technique and slightly low lung volumes.
The lungs are clear without pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There is no definite confluent consolidation to reflect pneumonia.
Multiple left rib deformities are consistent with remote fractures.
IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of pneumonia.
EKG [**2164-5-19**]: afib at 160s no signs of ischemia  TTE [**2164-5-22**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
Was felt seizures were related to EtOH withdrawal, as patient has experienced wthdrawal seizures in the past.
He was admitted to the ICU for monitoring given this and his arrhythmia (see below).
He did have a mild transaminitis, which was trended and remained stable.
#Afib: Patient was in new Afib with RVR, but converted to sinus rhythm after being started on a diltiazem gtt in the ICU.
No prior known history of Afib.
Most likely that Afib was secondary to EtOH withdrawal and electrolyte abnormalities.
Anticoagulation or antiplatelet tx was felt to be unsafe given CHADS2 score of zero, with hx of alcoholism and frequent falls.
# Anemia- new Hct drop to 30 from baseline of high 30s to low 40s.
No obvious evidence of bleeding.
Head CT on admission did show a small R frontal subgaleal hematoma, for which no intervention was done.
Urine cx showed mixed flora suggestive of contamination rather than true cystitis.
# CXR findings- possible patchiness of RML/RLL, however clinically did not have signs/sx of pneumonia.
Has follow-up in cardiology clinic to decide whether to continue this medication, or whether AF was transient due to above issues.
You were also found to have a new abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
