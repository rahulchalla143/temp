HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 77-year-old woman with history of severe COPD, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, and hypertension, here with COPD exacerbation.
COPD exacerbation:  Patient likely had symptoms exacerbated by URI symptoms.
She had completed a seven day course of levofloxacin and is to complete a two week course of steroids for her COPD exacerbation.
She was also restarted on her home regimen of high-dose Flovent, then Serevent standing to help with some baseline control.
She continued to have some productive cough with sputums that just contained oral contaminants.
However, this continued to improve and she was continued on guaifenesin, which helped with her cough.
Otherwise, the patient will go for rehab for continued rehab and strength training as she is very deconditioned at present.
ST depressions:  Patient came in with ST depressions likely demand ischemia with inferolateral T-wave inversions.
Her beta-blocker was held because of her COPD exacerbation.
Atrial tachycardia:  Unsure source, likely exacerbated by her pulmonary disease, episodes of tachy-brady on telemetry, and occasional PVCs improved over the course of her stay as her pulmonary disease became more stable.
Urinary tract infection:  Patient had recurrent urinary tract infections during her stay.
Leukocytosis:  Patient had a leukocytosis up to 30,000 with bands and metamyelocytes on her differential.
However, her leukocytosis was resolving and by the time of discharge, was less than 18,000 with no bands and atypical cells.
Likely was attributed to her acute infectious process, and patient is recommended to have an outpatient CBC once her acute process has resolved.
If there is evidence of atypical cells, then to pursue a further hematologic workup.
Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 2364**] mental status:  Patient had some evidence of waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 2364**] mental status especially in the Intensive Care Unit after extubation likely secondary to acute hypoxia from her present illness versus fevers from her infections versus just sundowning in light of being in the hospital.
She had a head CT, which was otherwise negative except for an old left frontotemporal infarct, which was benign.
She was continued on her Zoloft for depression, and started on risperidone for some sundowning and insomnia effects.
Anemia:  Likely it was stable throughout the course of her stay likely from chronic disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Atrial tachycardia.
Urinary tract infection.
Patient on minimal oxygen, ambulating with some assistance, and otherwise pain free.
Patient is to continue to follow her atrial arrhythmia and hypertension.
Patient is also to eventually have followup CBC to make sure persistence of no further atypical cells.
