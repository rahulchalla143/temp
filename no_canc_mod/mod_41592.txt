**FINAL REPORT [**2135-6-18**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2135-6-18**]):    NO GROWTH.
**FINAL REPORT [**2135-6-23**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2135-6-23**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Head CT demonstrates encephalomalacia in the right temporal region with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the middle cerebral artery distribution indicative of an evolving infarct.
No hemorrhage seen.
CT perfusion demonstrates large area of increased transit time and decreased blood volume and decreased blood flow.
The findings indicate a large area of ischemia and infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates no evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis.
There is some visualization of the vascular structures seen within the right sylvian region likely secondary to collateral circulation.
Hyperdensity in the right temporoparietal cortices, basal ganglia and right frontal subarachnoid spaces, can be relate to the recent contrast administration or hemorrhage.
COPD, cardiomegaly, ?pulmonary hypertension, and mild upper zone redistribution.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2135-6-18**] 2:13 PM FINDINGS:  There is a right middle cerebral artery infarct identified involving the basal ganglia and frontal lobe.
There is low signal intensity seen within the basal ganglia on susceptibility images indicative of hemorrhage.
There is mild mass effect on the right lateral ventricle without midline shift.
There is subtle increased signal along the right side of the brain stem, which extends to the perimesencephalic cistern and to the quadrigeminal cistern.
This is suspicious for subarachnoid hemorrhage and should be further evaluated on followup CT.
Acute right middle cerebral artery infarct with blood products indicating hemorrhage in the basal ganglia region.
Probable subarachnoid hemorrhage along the midbrain and right ambient cistern which can be further evaluated with a followup CT as the immediate post contrast CT demonstrated vascular enhancement due to presence of contrast and was limited for evaluation of subarachnoid blood.
Moderate diffuse cardiomegaly is stable.
There is mild vascular congestion.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Lung volume has been reduced but lungs are clear and there is no large-scale atelectasis.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN	Study Date of [**2135-6-24**] 8:16 AM FINDINGS:  A large amount of free intraperitoneal air is seen under the hemidiaphragms.
Limited evaluation of the lower lungs demonstrates no acute abnormality.
There is no pneumothorax.
Very small pleural effusions layer posteriorly.
The balloon of a PEG projects over the location of the stomach.
Bowel gas pattern is unremarkable, except for formed stool throughout the course of a mildly distended colon.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

# Neurology: On initial assessment, she had an NIHSS of 23 and she was noted to be globally aphasic with a dense left hemiaresis of face, arm and leg.
Initial CT showed loss of grey-white matter differentiation in the right MCA distribution indicative of an evolving infarct and CTA showed occlusion of the M1 segment of the right MCA.
CTP showed a large area of ischemia and infarction in the right MCA territory.
She was administered IV tPA as she was within the time window and had no contraindications.
At neuro-intervention, they catheterized the right ICA with Merci catheter was placed and they catheterized the right MCA with the use of a Solitaire stent retriever and following balloon angioplasty of a high grade stenosis of the right MCA, there was TIMI 2 flow at the end of the procedure and she was transferred to the Neuro ICU post-procedure.
In the ICU, post-procedure CT head scan demonstrated likely extravasation of contrast material into the right temporoparietal cortices, basal ganglia and right frontal subarachnoid spaces.
MRI showed a completed right MCA infarct with minimal edema or midline shift but there was evidence of blood products indicating hemorrhage in the basal ganglia.
She was placed on telemetry which showed persistent AF.
An echo was performed to look for thrombus and this showed no evidence of intra-cardiac clot and revealed normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function with EF >60%,  pulmonary HTN and  aortic valve sclerosis.
She was transferred from the ICU to the floor on [**2135-6-21**] and she was noted to initially be bradycardic to the 40s which was attributed to her timolol eye drops.
These were held and bradycardia resolved.
She failed repeated swallow evaluations on the floor and given this went on to have a PEG on [**2135-6-23**] without post-operative complications.
This was complicated by excessive abdominal insufflation during the procedure with a tense abdomen, and thus had a protracted intubation in the PACU.
She had no further issues and she was easily extubated and transferred back to the floor on [**2135-6-24**] where her exam remained stable.
She continued to have a considerable pneumoperitoneum on repeat imaging although abdomen was soft and patient was uncomfortable, hence tube feeds were held for bowel rest and were restarted on [**2135-6-27**].
The likely aetiology of her stroke is cardioembolic from her new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.
# CV: Patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation on admission.
To allow autoregulation, she was started on [**2-7**] home dose of her home furosemide and this was eventually changed to po and other anti-hypertensives were held.
# Nutrition/GIS: She was kept NPO given aspiration risk and she initially had an NG tube.
Due to persistent failed swallow assessments, she proceeded to a PEG on [**2135-6-24**] as above.
This was complicated by excessive abdominal insufflation during the procedure with imaging showing a very large pneumoperitoneum.
She initially had a tense abdomen and given her large pneumoperitoneum, she was kept intubated overnight in the PACU.
# ID: Patient was found to have a positive UA.
# Ophthalmology: She was started on her usual glaucoma eye drops.
Bradycardia settled and timolol was restarted at half concentration.
Transitional issues [ ] Patient will require daily INR monitoring and to stop aspirin and s/c heparin when INR therapeutic [ ] Next INR to be drawn on [**2135-6-28**] [ ] Patient had bradycardia to 40s (no HD compromise) and resolved after stopping timolol eye drops.
[ ] Patient had PEG tube inserted [**6-23**] and had excessive insufflation of abdomen requiring protracted intubation and tube feeds restarted [**6-25**] then held for bowel rest given patient discomfort and continued pneumoperitoneum.
[ AHA/ASA Core Measures for Ischemic Stroke ] 1.

(x) Yes - () No (if LDL >100, Reason Not Given: ) 10.
Discharged on oral anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter?
3. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Acute Ischemic Stroke (R MCA) 2.
Atrial fibrillation .
Urinary tract infection 2.
Dysphagia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Eye opening apraxia but fervently cloes eyes when try to open but can open eyes spontaneously to command intermittently.
You presented after sudden collapse and left-sided weakness and being unable to speak.
You had a CT scan which showed a stroke on the right side of your brain and evidence of a blocked artery supplying this area.
YOu were also found to be in an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation which is likely the cause for your stroke as the irregular heartbeat predisposes to blood clots forming within the heart and thence going up to the brain to cause  a stroke.
As you had persistent swallowing difficulties you had a feeding tube inserted into the stomach called a PEG tube.
This may be only temporary if your swallow improves such that you can be started on an oral diet.
We initially treated you with aspirin for your stroke however when you had your PEG tube inserted, we started you on a blood thinner called warfarin to reduce the risk of stroke given your atrial fibrillation.
Warfarin requires frequent monitoring initially and can cause increased bleeding and hence if you cut yourself you will be more prone to bleeding.
You were also found to have a urinary tract infection and were started on an antibiotic for this.
As you had a low heartrate which we felt may have been due to your glaucoma eye drops we reduced the dose.
