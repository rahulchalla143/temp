On the day of his admission to [**Hospital1 2436**] he was extremely fatigued and she noticed he was dyspneic with minimal exertion.
He had not been complaining of shortness of breath of chest pain.
Daughter also reports that patient seemed to have some trouble swallowing his food and was frequently coughing/choking.
For several days prior to the fall patient had been complaining of extreme fatigue and the daughter noted him to have significant dyspnea on exertion.
He had also been complianing of back pain and had been taking vicodin sevreal days prior to admission.
In [**Hospital1 **] ER found to be borderline hypotensive SBP 90-110, and HR in 90s sating 100% on 4L and afebrile- showed ST dep 1-2mm in V4-V6 and STE of 1mm in V1/V2.
Found to have LLL infiltrate and R sided pleural effusion.
Noted to have guiac + stools, no gross blood.
Became acutely unresponsive w/ labored breathing and HR in 20-30 (palpable) and SBP down to 50, patient rec'd atropine and pressors.
EGD performed revealing duodenal bulb ulcer w/ visible vessel for which bicap/epi was applied, ?
ischemic changes of gastric mucosa.
Per ICU team- pt also had 15 beat run of NSVT w/o hemodyamic compromise and "resolving delerium."
Past Medical History: -CAD - s/p CABG in [**2097**] (for anatomy see outside records in chart), per PCP free of angina symptoms since then -A fib - dx in [**4-1**], on coumadin since then, INR on [**10-13**] was 2.5 -valvular heart disease - ECHO at [**Hospital1 2436**] in [**4-1**] w/ EF 50-555%, mild AS, mod AR, mod MR, mod TR - has been asymptomatic -PVD - s/p r fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass (?
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: T 98.6, BP 114/62, HR 94, RR 18, sat 93% RA HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM, poor dentition Lungs: LLL ronchi, decreased breath sounds at the R base Cards: irregularly irregular, diastolic and systolic murmur, unable to characterize Abd: + bs, soft, mildly distended abdomen Ext: 1+ lower ext edema bilat, pulses PT 1+ bilaterally.
Mottled red/purple appearing mucosa in the stomach body/fundus compatible with ischemic changes.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage identified.
Encephalomalacia in the right frontal and right temporal regions suggest prior hemorrhage, contusion or infarct.
[**2116-10-28**] repeat Head CT: No significant change since [**2116-10-20**] with no intracranial hemorrhages.
mildly dilated LV, intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurg.
No evidence of traumatic aortic injury or retroperitoneal hematoma.
Patchy opacity in the left lung base, likely aspiration, with developing pneumonia.
Moderate right-sided simple pleural effusion.
Extensive paraseptal emphysema.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the coronary arteries, aorta, and its major branches.
Cystic structure associated with the left hip joint, which could be a synovial cyst or fluid within a bursa, other joint pathology cannot be excluded and an MRI could be of value   Brief Hospital Course: GI bleed: in setting of INR 22 (on [**10-19**], although 6 days earlier was reportedly 2.5).
Hct initially 16, found to have ulcer w/ visible vessel.
NSTEMI: In the setting of severe anemia and hypovolemia the patient had an elevated troponin, ST depressions in the antero-lateral leads and a CK that peaked in the 800s.
He was started on an ACEi and was diuresed for mild volume overload.
He was started on lasix 20mg po daily upon discharge, this should be titrated to a goal diuresis of net negative 500cc daily, please titrate his diuretic based upon his volume status and renal function.
If patient must restart ASA 81mg daily in the future per cardiology would not restart until re-evaluated by GI and ulcer has resolved on repeat endoscopy.
CHF: previously no documented history of CHF but in acute NSTEMI EF was 30%, increased to 40-45% upon re-ECHO.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Constipation.
