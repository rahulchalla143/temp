She was diuresed 1L with 40 mg IV lasix, with SBP dropping to 50s-60s transiently and recovering to 100s spontaneously.
Abdominal CT showed no inflammation or abscess as source of infection, improved ascites and bilateral pleural effusions.

atelectasis and bil patchy ground glass opacities, likely pneumonitis.
New inferior akinesis, global hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 25 %).
No masses or thrombi in the LV.

Echodense mass protruding from R coronary sinus of Valsalva c/w consistent with a coronary stent --> absent after bypass.
Congestive heart failure shows improvement with decreasing pulmonary edema and improving right pleural effusion.
Left effusion and retrocardiac atelectasis are not substantially changed.
Chest XRAY [**2127-7-11**] Interval worsening of interstitial edema with left basilar opacity representative of collapse/consolidation with probable effusion  Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo with CHF, PVD, CAD, hx of MRSA indwelling foley, s/p recent aorto-fem [**Doctor Last Name **] bypass c/b wound infection admitted with SOB likely [**1-10**] to CHF exacerbation with course c/b self-resolving hypotension following diuresis continued on diuresis on admission.
SOB [**1-10**] decompensated CHF given CXR showing worsening effusion and edema.
A new ECHO performed as an inpatient revealed inferior hypokinesis suggestive of a recent MI of unknown date (EF of 20-25%) but negative troponins and negative ECG on admission.
Infection was a less likely trigger given the absence of leukocytosis and hx of aztreonam and vancomycin prior to admission.
PNA was an unlikely trigger given a stable CXR with improving pleural effusions, absence of fever/leukocytosis on aztreonam/vancomycin.
No hx of dietary indiscretion or medical noncompliance.
On [**2126-7-3**], while actively being diuresed (on a lasix drip with metolazone), the patient had episode of hypotension and unresponsiveness (a code was called).
This was thought likely to be cause by a combination of hypotension, slight bradycardia and medications administered prior to the code (zofran and morphine).
Also of note, the systolic blood pressures in her right arm are 30-40 mmHg lower than her left arm (likely [**1-10**] subclavian artery stenosis on right).
Patient had an episode of vomiting and likely aspirated based on the chest x-ray finding of likley aspiration PNA.
Patient had persistent hypotension after the code and the patient was started on dopamine.
Patient was slowly weaned off, but cause of hypotension is not completely clear though it was thought likely secondary to both hypovolemia and possible measurement of blood pressure from right arm.
The patient briefly had an elevated oxygen requirement in the MICU, but was kept on aztreonam and vancomycin (as previously started by vascular team with indefinite time course).
However, the patient had subsequent fevers and metronidazole was started for concern for aspiration.
Of note, an ART line was placed while in the MICU for accurate measurement of BP and ABG.
Urine culture positive for yeast only.
Blood cultures grew coag neg staph from [**7-11**] from 1/2 bottles - likely contaminant given that she was already on Vanc which was therapeutic.
Urine cultures grew out yeast initially, with resolution after removal of the Foley catheter.
Her fever curve started trending down and was afebrile for more than 3 days prior to discharge.
The patient had a known SMA and celiac artery stenosis, though ischemic changes were not evident.
Pain control: She continued to have lower extremity pain from her neuropathy and groin wound.
Anemia: the patient was noted to have a newly macrocytic anemia despite folate and B12 supplementation, most likely anemia of chronic disease.
Stool has been guaiac negative, RBC morphology with macrocytosis but no polychromia.
Pulmonary: She had aspiration PNA as mentioned above and completed Flagyl course.
Incentive spirometry as well as chest PT and continued treatement with nebs were encouraged, and the patient's respiratory status improved to an oxygen requirement of 1-2L NC, with CPAP as needed at night.
Menthol-Cetylpyridinium Cl 2 mg Lozenge Sig: One (1) Lozenge Mucous membrane PRN (as needed) as needed for sore throat.

Your symptoms were most likely caused by heart failure, which caused  fluid to accumulate around your lungs and led to difficulty breathing and leg swelling.
Morphine must be used in very low doses as it may make you confused or drowsy.
The wound in your right groin is covered with a VAC dressing.
Watch for the following signs and symptoms and notify your doctor if these occur: Foul-smelling drainage or fluid from the wound;  Increased redness or swelling of the wound or skin around it; Increasing tenderness or pain in or around the wound .
If you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers >100.4, copious diarrhea, light headedness/feeling as if you are going to faint, inability to perform your normal activities, or a productive cough, please come to the nearest emergency room or talk to your doctors.
You have an outpatient appointment with a cardiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on Tuesday [**8-5**] at 3:20pm, where you will discuss options for medication called amiodarone, and use of a implanatable cardiac defibrillator vs. biventricular pacemaker to control your heart rhythm.
