HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old gentleman with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, with no known coronary artery disease who presented to an outside hospital complaining of [**6-16**] left chest pain that had started at 3 a.m. on the morning of admission.
No associated radiation of the chest.
No nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, or diaphoresis.
The pain improved to [**2-14**] status post sublingual nitroglycerin times two.
Electrocardiogram revealed 1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads I and aVL with inferior lateral depressions.
A subsequent catheterization revealed 3-vessel disease with no left main disease and no total occlusion, status post Retavase.
The patient was now awaiting Cardiothoracic Surgery consultation for evaluation for possible coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient is currently chest pain free on a nitroglycerin drip at the time of evaluation.
Poor balance; status post back surgery times five years ago.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No drug abuse.
General examination revealed he was an obese comfortable male and in no acute distress.
Jugular venous distention was difficult to assess secondary to body habitus.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops were appreciated.
His extremities were significant for a hematoma at the right femoral site which had already been marked out.
No tenderness to palpation.
There were 1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads I and aVL with inferolateral 1-mm to 2-mm ST depressions, showing serial interval changes with T wave inversions in leads I and aVL and decreased inferolateral depressions.
His left ventriculography showed no mitral regurgitation, ejection fraction was 35%, with anterior dyskinesis.
His coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant system.
There was no disease in the left main coronary artery.
He had a 90% lesion in his left anterior descending artery at second diagonal.
His left circumflex had a ramus intermedius 90% proximal lesion with the obtuse marginal bifurcation had serial 90% lesions to the inferior pole.
Finally, his dominant right coronary artery had a 90% lesion in the posterolateral branch.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  (a)  Coronary artery disease: The patient was transferred from an outside hospital for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction after having been treated with thrombolytic therapy.
He subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 188**] which showed 3-vessel disease and subsequently was referred to Cardiothoracic Surgery for a possible coronary artery bypass graft.
(b)  Pump function:  Despite normal right-sided filling pressures, the patient was felt to be in mild congestive heart failure based upon rales on examination and lower extremity edema.
The patient was also mildly hypoxic and wheezing on his examination.
He had an initial left ventriculography which showed an ejection fraction of 35%; although no comparison studies were available.
He eventually was treated empirically for mild congestive heart failure.
Secondary to enlarge body habitus it was difficult to exclude focal wall motion abnormalities.
The patient was found to have trivial mitral regurgitation and an impaired left ventricular inflow pattern, suggestive of impaired relaxation and diastolic dysfunction.
The patient was to follow up with his primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24298**] and cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32255**]) in several days' time for further re-evaluation of his volume status and electrolytes.
As mentioned above, he had a brief hypotensive episode after sheath removal following his second cardiac catheterization which responded appropriately with intravenous fluids.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  As mentioned above, the patient was found to be mildly hypoxic and wheezing during his hospitalization.
The patient was treated empirically for congestive heart failure with Lasix for a goal diuresis of one liter negative per day.
He was scheduled for followup with his primary care physician and cardiologist for further assessment of his volume status.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient was initially transferred to the Coronary Care Unit following initial cardiac catheterization showing 3-vessel disease and was found to have a slight right groin hematoma.
It was confirmed on the computed tomography scan on [**1-2**] a right groin hematoma extending into right thigh without evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
The patient did have a drop in his hematocrit from 37 to 30 following his second cardiac catheterization prompting a computed tomography scan.
Finally, the patient should have an outpatient evaluation of his thyroid function.
He was found to have a mildly increased thyroid-stimulating hormone of 6 and mildly depressed free T4 to 0.9.
Status post ST-elevation myocardial infarction with 3-vessel disease.
Congestive heart failure presumed secondary to diastolic dysfunction.
The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24298**] in several days for evaluation of his volume status and hypothyroidism.
