Admission Date:  [**2133-11-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2133-11-22**]   Service:  CICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old female with no significant past medical history who presented to an outside hospital with acute onset substernal chest pain.
The patient reports acute onset of substernal chest pain while at rest with radiation to the jaw.
The chest pain was associated with diaphoresis; however, the patient denies shortness of breath, palpitations, as well as lightheadedness.
The chest pain persisted for several hours before the patient presented to the hospital.
In the outside hospital Emergency Department, the patient was found hemodynamically stable with an electrocardiogram that demonstrated ST elevations in leads III and aVF with ST depressions in the lateral and precordial leads.
The patient received intravenous nitroglycerin without complete resolution of the chest pain and was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for intervention.
The patient denies a prior history of myocardial infarction; however, on review of systems describes exertional chest pain for several weeks prior to admission.
The patient also denies a prior diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  Allergies included PENICILLIN (reaction unknown).
The patient reports a remote tobacco history and denies the use of alcohol or recreational drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history notable for a sister with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction at the age of 80.
Mildly obese.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
No wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
Abdominal examination revealed soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Extremity examination revealed right groin with arterial sheath in place with 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.
Warm and well perfused distal extremities with no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission to the outside hospital revealed complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 9.1, hematocrit was 41.2, and platelets were 245.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Initial electrocardiogram at the outside hospital demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm with normal axis, intraventricular conduction delay, 1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads III and aVF with ST depressions in the lateral and anterior precordial leads.
Electrocardiogram #2 at the outside hospital revealed a normal sinus rhythm with persistent intraventricular conduction delay; consistent with right bundle-branch block, now with inferior Q waves.
Electrocardiogram #3 at the outside hospital revealed a normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions, ST elevations in lead III, with resolved ST elevations in aVF.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with left heart catheterization demonstrating a normal left main artery, mildly diseased left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery, and 95% medial right coronary artery stenosis.
The right heart catheterization demonstrated elevated filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of 17, right ventricular pressures of 45/23, pulmonary artery pressure of 42/23, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22.
The patient ruled in for an inferior myocardial infarction with a peak creatine kinase of 1011, peak MB of 90, and CK/MB index of 8.9.
The patient remained chest pain free throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was started on a low-dose beta blocker and subsequently ACE inhibitor without complications.
On hospital day three, the patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram which demonstrated depressed left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 40%, hypokinesis of the posterior and inferior left ventricular walls, and 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation.
Inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%.
