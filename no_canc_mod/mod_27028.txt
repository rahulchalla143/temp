No evidence for osseous encroachment upon the spinal canal.
No evidence for vertebral artery or carotid stenosis, dissection or aneurysmal dilatation.
Paranasal sinus disease as detailed above.
Liver laceration causing massive hemoperitoneum and vascular depletion.
Multiple right-sided rib fractures.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Right hip x-ray: prelim: mild right osteoarthritis (no fracture).
C collar placed, to be kept on at all times  [**10-28**]: Angiogram for decreasing hematocrit, it did not reveal any arterial source of bleeding and no intervention could be performed for the venous bleeding.
U/S liver showed TIPS patent, transfused 3 units PRBC's, 1 unit platelets, 1 cryo, 2 FFP, given Factor VII, intubated for increasing respiratory distress  [**10-29**]: Central line placed, continued intubated, sedated  [**10-30**]: paracentesis removed 1.6L fluid, lasix gtt started  [**10-31**]: Tube feeds started  [**11-2**]: vancomycin started for VAP  [**11-3**]: extubated successfully, lasix drip stopped, started on prn lasix IV  [**11-5**]: PICC line placed, central line removed  [**11-6**]: transferred to [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] with hepatic encephalopathy on 4 L NC  [**11-8**]: On [**11-8**], day of transfer to MICU, noted to be increasingly tachypneic to 30s, O2 req increase f/3LNC to 5LNC.
Concern for PE (had been on hep sq since [**10-31**]), but given hx of bleed and RF, CTA not performed.
[**11-8**] - [**11-13**] In the MICU his hypoxia was worked up and it was felt to be secondary to his ascites.
He underwent two large volume paracentesis during which 14 L of fluid were removed with improvement in his respiratory status, currently on room air.
He had a few days of low grade fevers, however infectious workup has been negative.
On [**11-12**] he underwent a diagnostic para due to fever which was bloody, however had no evidence of SBP.
He began requiring 1 L of oxygen the next day and had decreased mental status, likely hepatic encephalopathy.
His lactulose was increased and he underwent a diagnostic para which showed no evidence of SBP and a CXR showed no infiltrate.
A/P:  54 yo male with PMH of ETOH cirrhosis, DM, and hypothyroidism was tranferred from an OSH on [**10-27**] after a MVA complicated by a a dens fracture, a non-weight bearing T8 wedge fracture, and hemoperitoneum (now stable with medical management) with continued hepatic encephalopathy since extubation.
# Altered mental status: The patient was alert and oriented when he presented to the hospital, but after he was extubated in the TICU he was persistently encephalopathic.
A head CT showed no bleed or acute intracranial process.
Infectious workups were presistently negative, blood and urine cultures were no growth and repeated paracenteses showed no evidence of SBP.
The only sign of infection was MRSA in his sputum as described below.
Most likely delirium versus continued hepatic encephalopathy.
# ARF: The patient's Cr increased from 1.2 to 2.0 the night of admission likely secondary to acute blood loss causing volume depletion and possible ATN, although no documented hypotension.
There was a question of compartement syndrome during his hospitalization.
A renal US on [**11-7**] showed no hydronephrosis and normal dopplers.
Patient was started on octreotide and midodrine for possible HRS, however was later discontinued as it is felt ARF secondary to pre-renal.
# Respiratory status: The patient was on RA when he was transferred out of the TICU initially, however he began to have increasing oxygen requirement and tachypnea.
There was concern for PE, but no DVTs seen on b/l lower extremity US.
This episode of hypoxia attributed to his massive ascites.
# Hospital aquired pneumonia: The patient was started on vancomycin on [**11-2**] when MRSA grew out of his sputum culture; he was intubated and on the ventilator at the time.
# Cirrhosis - The patient has EtOH cirrhosis and is not on the transplant list due to social issues; He has a hx of portal gastropathy, h/o acites requiring large volume paracenteses in the past, SBP, grade 1 esophageal varices, grade 2 internal hemorrhoids, and hepatic encephalopathy.
The patient was treated with lactulose and rifaximin as above for encephalopathy.
# Liver laceration: The patient developed a liver laceration after a MVA and was medically managed with 16U PRBCs, 8U FFP, 2U platelets, 2 units of cryp, and a factor 7 infusion (his last transfusion was on [**10-28**]).
# Hypernatremia: The patient had issues with hypernatremia during his hospitalization given his NPO status and inability to regulate his water intake (on nectar thickened liquids).
- Continue Flush w/ 500 water q4h and encourage thickened water intake  # Dens fracture: Patient was found to have a dens fracture and was evaluated by neurosurgery who recommended conservative treatment.
This was deemed an ould fracture by neurosurgery and requires no activity limitation.
# R hip pain: prelim x-ray demonstrated mild osteoarthritis.
# History of tips thrombosis: Coumadin was stopped due to acute bleed.
