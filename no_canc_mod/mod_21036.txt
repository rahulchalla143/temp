Admission Date:  [**2133-3-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-3-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: Sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC Line Placement Attempted ureteral stent placement by urology Percutaneous nephrostomy catheter placement by interventional radiology   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 88 yo woman with h/o dementia, recurrent UTIs, and CHF, who was brought in by ambulance from her nursing home with decreasing mental status over the past two days.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2133-2-8**] to [**2133-2-11**] for an acute left MCA stroke, for which she received TPA.
At the time of her discharge to her nursing home, she still had residual expressive aphasia but otherwise did not have any new neurologic deficits.
She also had a CXR, which was concerning for retrocardiac opacity v. atelectasis.
She had abdominal tenderness on physical exam, so a CT abdomen was performed prior to admission.
She otherwise has no new complaints.

**FINAL REPORT [**2133-3-15**]**     Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2133-3-15**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
STUDIES: [**2133-3-12**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2133-2-8**] atrial fibrillation is new.
[**2133-3-12**] CXR: Retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.
No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Bilateral soft tissue nodules in the cervical tissues.
Correlation with oncologic history or further workup with possible MRI of the neck is recommended.
Right ureteral stone.
No hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
Free fluid within the retroperitoneum and pelvis, suggestive of decompression via forniceal rupture.
Significantly distended gallbladder with multiple stones.
Bilateral pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis.
[**2133-3-12**] RUQ U/S: Distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis and mild focal wall edema.
No biliary dilation identified.
Findings are nonspecific for acute cholecystitis and clinical correlation recommended.
[**2133-3-19**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and preserved biventricular systolic function.
Increased left ventricular filling pressures.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Left pleural effusion.
Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, increased in size.
Bilateral atelectasis, with infection likely a very small component of the observed consolidations.
Coronary artery and aortic calcifications.
Heterogenous left thyroid lobe, for which US can be performed to better evaluate.
Striated nephrogram on the right consistent with pyelonephritis; ischemic change is less likely.
A 14-mm right renal stone is essentially unchanged.
Mild urothelial thickening of the renal pelvis may represent infectious involvement though can be seen in the presence of the stent.
Mottled perfusion of the liver could be secondary to congestive heart failure in the setting of a prominent atrium and mitral regurgitation.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Left greater than right moderate pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Discharge Labs: Na 135, K 3.7, Cl 100, HCO3 27, BUN 8, Cr 0.5, Glucose 9, Ca 9, Mg 1.9, P 2.6, WBC 11.9, Hgb 10.2, HCT 29.7, Platelets 519  Brief Hospital Course: 88 yo woman with h/o dementia, recurrent UTIs, and recent CVA, who presented with AMS and hypotension in the setting of urosepsis.
Urosepsis: Ms. [**Known lastname **] U/A was concerning for infection and CT Abdomen/Pelvis showed a R ureteral stone with associated stranding and free fluid in the RP and lower abdomen consistent with forniceal rupture.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] urine culture and blood cultures grew out E. coli with sensitivies as above and she was narrowed to ceftriaxone.
Patient had repeat imaging concerning for pyelonephritis and had UA consistent with infection in right kidney.
New onset Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with new AF in the ED which continued throughout MICU course.
Had a couple of episodes of RVR which responded well to diltiazem.
Risks and benefits of anticoagulation were discussed with Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 9241**], who felt that patient has very low fall risk and does not attemt to get out of bed at her long term care facility.
Her condition improved with treatment of urosepsis as above and vancomycin was d/c-ed as suspicion for pneumonia decreased.
Patient continued have oxygen requirement throughout ICU course and had crackles and pleural effusions.
She was diuresed with IV lasix and her oxygen requirement resolved and her exam improved.
[**Last Name (un) **] likely multifactorial secondary to both obstruction as well as hypotension.
Enlarged Gallbladder: On physical exam, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had RUQ tenderness, and her CT abdomen demonstrated a significantly enlarged gallbladder.
Per discussion with radiology and surgery, it appears that cholecystitis is not the likely cause of her septic shock in the setting of urosepsis, as described above.
