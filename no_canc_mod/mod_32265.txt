Admission Date:  [**2199-2-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-3-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-1-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**] Chief Complaint: VT storm, unable to extubate after VT ablation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VT ablation  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 76-year-old man with coronary artery disease status post single vessel CABG with previous critical aortic stenosis status post-aortic valve repair in [**2196**], status post AICD, history of PEA arrest, history of VT, who presented to [**Hospital1 **] with VT storm [**2-25**] with 40 ICD shocks and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for VT ablation.
with VT initially post CABG/AVR, and was started on amiodarone and mexelitine which he did not tolerate.
The patient denies prior palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath or dizziness.
In EP lab, intubated and found to have 2 separate foci near mitral valve annulus.
He was initially extubated, but was somewhat somnolent, and given a h/o hypoxia-induced PEA arrest s/p extubation from inguinal repair last year, pt.
In PACU, had CXR demonstrating likely reflecting left pleural effusion and fluid overload.
Review of PMH shows recent MCA stroke, with need for walker at baseline.
No report of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Per [**Hospital1 **] notes, he denied recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CAD status post 1v CABG (SVG-->OM).
AS status post AVR in [**2196**] which is a tissue valve.
PEA arrest in [**2197**] s/p hernia repair with prolonged intubation.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Left internal carotid artery stenosis.
Lumbar stenosis 16.  sternal nonunion after CABG [**07**].
Systolic and diastolic dysfunction presumed to be secondary to hypertensive diabetic and valvular heart disease.
Chronic renal failure, BL 1.2-1.3  Social History: The patient currently lives in [**Location 4288**] with his wife.
Sclera anicteric.
no carotid bruits CV: RR, normal S1, soft s2, loud harsh early systolic murmur best heard at LUSB Chest: Large anterior chest wall deformity with unstable sternum, large incision from CABG/valve repair well-healed.
No crackles, wheeze, rhonchi noted Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
L scar medial to arterial puncture site, sl.
indurated, well healed Skin: + mild stasis dermatitis, R shin ulcers 1.5mm X 2 mm, oval marked, with no crepitus, mild erythema.
1+ pitting edema to knees Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; dopplerable DP and PTs Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; dopplerable DP and PTs   Pertinent Results: CXR on admission: Lung volumes are low with opacification of the left lower lobe, likely reflecting left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
Vascular redistribution in the right upper lobe suggests fluid overload.
CXR at [**Hospital3 **] ([**2-25**]): The diaphragms are markedly elevated with low lung volumes.
This makes evaluation of the lung bases impossible.
There is suggestion of increasing interstitial opacities of the upper lung zones which could be a function of the high diaphragms or some superimposed edema.
LV dimensions mildly dilated.
There is global hypokinesis with abnormal septal motion.
RV is mildly dilated with moderate hypokinesis.
There is moderate biatrial enlargement.
Aortic valve bioprosthesis appears to be well seated with appropriate gradients for this valve.
Mitral leaflets are mildly thickened with mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with moderate PHTN.
A minimal pericardial effusion is seen.
Evidence of LVH as well as LAE.
Global LV systolic dysfunction.
Again, global hypokinesis was seen.
These findings however appear to be most consistent with a cardiomyopathy with moderate AS rather than hemodynamic insignificant AS.

Rhythm: He found to have 2 automatic foci which were the cause of his VT storm on presentation.
He was reduced to 200 mg Amiodarone sometime prior to admission for unclear reasons.
On the day of presentation, he underwent successful ablation of 1 of the 2 VT foci with other focus easily controlled in lab with burst pacing after pacer adjustment.
No benefit with vagal maneuver, carotid massage so IV lidocaine was given, amiodarone and mexiletine were discontinued and patient was switched to quinidine.
However, he developed diarreah on the quinidine so he was switched back to amiodarone and mexiletine.
He had no episodes of VT on this regimen and was discharged on telemetry monitoring with paced HR ranging in 70s.
CAD/Ischemia: Cath showed unchanged disease from previous.
Pump: Depressed EF to 30-35% compared to ECHO last year, with CXR e/o pleural effusion and pulmonary edema.
with limited BL activity [**1-5**] previous stroke, so unsure if class II or III NYHA CHF, though some evidence for benefit in both.
Respiratory failure: Given patient's history of difficult course post-extubation from prior procedure, he was watched closely after extubation from his EP procedure.
Microcytic anemia: Decreased Hct likely due to Fe deficiency + known thalassemia trait.
Patient's Hct remained stable throughout his hospital course with no indication of acute bleeding.
Cr bump likely pre-renal given significant diuresis and dry appearance on exam vs. contrast nephropathy from recent cath at [**Hospital3 **].
No changes in neuroexam post procedure.
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Final diagnosis Recurrent ventricular tachycardia  Secondary diagnosis Coronary artery disease Systolic congestive heart failure Acute on chronic renal fialure Hypertension Urinary retention   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a procedure to deactivate areas of your heart which were firing irregularly.
You had two areas of irregular activity and one of the two areas were deactivated.
