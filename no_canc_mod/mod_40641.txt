Admission Date:  [**2105-1-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2105-1-20**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 139**] Internal Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female resident of the [**Hospital3 **] Center for Aged with past medical history of CAD, right bundle branch block, and LAD, hypertension, status post colectomy for colon cancer with colostomy, who presented on the [**3-11**] to the hospital status post fall with left hip pain and a left hip fracture.
Colectomy for colon/rectal cancer with colostomy.
Right bundle branch block with LAD on EKG.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Patient was turned back in the supine position, given multiple chest compressions, Epinephrine and phenylephrine with immediate response, but was noted to have hypertensive and tachycardic response.
She was returned to the PACU, where she was noted on telemetry to have brief episode of second degree A-V block type two.
The patient briefly required mechanical ventilation for respiratory and metabolic acidosis, and was admitted to the MICU.
General:  Intubated, anxious patient.
Positive JVD, no bruits, and no lymphadenopathy.
Diffuse crackles.
Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen was soft, positive bowel sounds, ostomy bag with stool drainage.
Extremities:  Left foreshortened and externally rotated, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Given her history of fall leading to her hip fracture and intermittent type II Mobitz rhythm observed in the PACU, the patient was also maintained on telemetry.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was subsequently complicated by further arrhythmia--the patient was noted to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response as well as rate-related ischemic changes.
The patient reported having chest heaviness at the time of the episode.
Patient was maintained on telemetry and was not noticed to have further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
The patient was maintained on IV Heparin given her intermittent episode of atrial fibrillation.
Patient was felt to have either demand ischemia or mild MI in the setting of her RVR, as she was noted to subsequently have an increase in troponin from 0.01 to a maximum of 0.18 with similar rise in CK and CK-MB.
When the patient developed respiratory distress, her healthcare proxy was again [**Name (NI) 653**], and reaffirmed the family did not want the patient to be intubated or even noninvasively mechanically ventilated, and reaffirmed her status as DNR/DNI.
The patient continued to have ongoing hypoxia with SPO2 in the 80% range despite suctioning.
She remained tachypneic and with diffuse wheezes and rhonchi.
The patient's mental status declined following this episode, and the patient remained nonresponsive to verbal and tactile stimuli.
