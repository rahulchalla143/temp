The patient complained at that time of cough productive of small amounts of green sputum, as well as shortness of breath.
The patient has had a history of hyponatremia in the past.
This has been felt to be due to SIADH and successfully treated with fluid restriction.
She denies CP, SOB, abdominal pain (although she did have an "upset stomach" last night after eating eggs), fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, urinary symptoms.
Past Medical History: - COPD/Asthma on home O2 (2.5L/min) - Restrictive lung disease - HTN - CHF (diastolic, EF 55% in [**2109-2-2**]) - Moderate mental retardation - CKD, baseline Cr 1.8 - DM2 - h/o hyponatremia - Chronic LE edema - Dementia - IgA nephropathy - hearing loss - tobacco use - chronic constipation - hyperlipidemia   Social History: Lives in a group home.
Family History: nc  Physical Exam: Temp 98.8 BP 152/70 Pulse 59 Resp 16 O2 sat 95% on 2.5L nc Gen - Alert, no acute distress at rest.
Neck - Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no JVD.
Chest -  Few wheezes and diffuse rhonchi throughout bilaterally.
RRR, normal S1/S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
No fluid wave or shifting dullness.
No masses or organomegaly.
Extr - No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
No infiltrates are seen.
There has been no significant change since the prior chest x-ray of [**4-11**].
There is continued mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly.
There is increasing opacity in the left lower lobe, which raises the possibility of superimposed pneumonia.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Continued mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly.
Probable left lower lobe pneumonia.
There is prominence of the right hilum, consistent with enlarged pulmonary artery and lymphadenopathy seen on [**2109-2-5**] chest CT. Again seen is mild increase in interstitial opacities consistent with mild CHF.
No focal consolidations are seen in the increased opacity at the left lower lobe is likely secondary to patient's rotation.
IMPRESSION: No significant change from prior study with mild CHF.
Prominent right hilum consistent with enlarged pulmonary artery and lymphadenopathy seen on previous CT.   Brief Hospital Course: 1.
Resp distress: Pt's resp distress felt to be multifactorial due to COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and possibly component of CHF.
She likely has a component of obstructive sleep apnea, and would benefit from bipap at night.
She also was kept on solumedrol for a presumed COPD exacerbation and given levofloxacin for a LLL pna.
Hyponatremia:  This was felt to be due to polydypsia as well as hydrochlorothiazide usage.
CKD: Felt secondary to IgA nephropathy, baseline per notes between 1.8 and 2.4.
Renal followed her while in-house and felt that her hyponatremia was from polydypsia and HCTZ (see above).
