History of Present Illness: This is a 31 yo W with h/o intractable epilepsy who presented to OSH after having 7 seizures.
We intially had limited information given patient intubation and sedation and no collateral available.
Based on OSH records, patient is seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital1 487**] for temporal lobe epilepsy, with partial complex seizures and generalized seizures.
There is no description of the events (but later inferred to be GTC seizures given amnesia, whole body ache afterward, leukocytosis).
She did not return to baseline mental status in between seizures or after treatment, and she was intubated for airway protection.
CXR showed diffuse infiltrates c/w aspiration vs ARDS, and patient was requiring substantial ventilator settings.
There was concern for status epilepticis.
Past Medical History: Temporal lobe epilepsy s/p VNS Migraine Anxiety/depression Bipolar disorder Coarctation of the aorta Anemia Asthma  Social History: On [**Social Security Number 90055**]social security.
Lives with boyfriend, two children and boyfriend's uncle.
On Discharge: Changes in Examination:  General Appearance: Comfortable, overweight, no apparent distress.
No paraphasic errors.
Fund of knowledge for recent events within normal limits.
Posture normal and no truncal ataxia.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Unchanged severity of bilateral pulmonary opacities.
Increase in extent of a retrocardiac atelectasis.
CT Head [**2178-5-17**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute intracranial abnormality.
EEG [**2178-5-17**] (further EEG's pending) IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured a single pushbutton activation that did not show evidence of seizures.
Routine sampling showed a mildly encephalopathic background with faster frequencies suggestive of medication effect.
There was also some more normal-appearing sleep patterns later in the night but continued bursts of generalized slowing and occasional suppressions of the background to suggest encephalopathy.
There were no prominent focal abnormalities, and there were no definite epileptiform features.

She became hypotensive and two pressors were started as described in the HPI above.
She underwent EEG monitoring which initially corresponded to the sedation with burst suppression, then generalized slowing with bitemporal predominance, then slow normal EEG with temporal sharp waves - the latter in [**Location (un) **] with previously described abnormalities.
There were no seizures.
Lung Opacities Given Lung opacities were noted on arrival, improving somewhat with gentle diuresis.
The latter seems an unlikely cause of infiltrate, there was no evidence of prior respiratory infection, so it is possible that this relates to cocaine use.
At the time of discharge here was no cough, lung sounds were clear, there was no fever or leukocytosis, so antibiotic therapy was stopped.
If you experience cough or fever, you should go to your doctor.
If you are short of breath or having any other concerning symptoms, you should go to your nearest hospital."
Microcytic Anemia Likely iron deficiency.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital after having seizures in the context of missing some medication, recent sleep deprivation and a 'bender'.
You underwent EEG monitoring which initially corresponded to the sedation that you had received, then demonstrated previously described abnormalities without seizures.
If you experience cough or fever, you should go to your doctor.
If you are short of breath or having any other concerning symptoms, you should go to your nearest hospital.
