Slight interval increase in size of left temporo-parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with slightly increased amount of blood layering dependently in the lateral ventricles.
No new areas of hemorrhage.
No herniation or midline shift.
Multiple foci of bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, with interval worsening compared to prior scan, now also involving dependent portions of bilateral posterior ventricular horns.
New right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and possible left tentorial subdural hematoma.
Left preseptal soft tissue swelling.
Bilateral subcutaneous gas in the lateral temporal soft tissues, with no definite underlying fracture.
TTE [**2162-8-21**] : There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %).
There is a conduit from the left ventricular apex that probably connects to the descending aorta.
It appears widely patent with substantial flow.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe global LV hypokinesis.
Severely thickened and calcified aortic leaflets.
There is a conduit seen from the left ventricular apex.
At least mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 87 year old male with known multiple medical problems (though unclear chronicity and level of debility) as well as on chronic anticoagulation for AF presenting after a fall at home with subarachnoid hemorage.
On [**8-25**] he was found to be more somnolent, responding intermittently to sternal rub with [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] respirations in the setting of new coagulopathy and hepatitis.
During his stay, the following issues were addressed: 1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage:  Neuro checks were done Q2;  mental status was responsive and oriented to person but not place or time on presentation and he had no focal neurological deficits.
Head CT showed an intraparencyhmal hemorrhage in the right temperoparietal region that was stable on repeat head CTs.
On the day of discharge, mental status acutely changed and patient was transitioned to comfort measures only with IM ativan as needed for seizure activity.
Anticoagulation has been for hx of atrial fibrillation and also has a graft connecting his left ventricle to descending aorta placed at [**Hospital1 2025**]; cardiology was consulted and they felt that given his low CHADS2 score and after reviewing the graft, they felt that holding coumadin in setting of bleed was appropriate.
During his hospital course, despite further vitamin K and FFP, he became more hypercoagulable in the setting of acute hepatitis and absence of clear DIC.
Ultimately, may not have been syncopal episode and think patient's lack of memory likely due to concussion/head trauma not necessarily loss of consciousness.
Echo severe LV systolic dysfunction.
4) Hx CAD: No signs of active ischemia.
No ASA given bleeding risk and no BB given concern for BP in setting of bleed.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) inhalation Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing, shortness of breath.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: 1-2 mg Injection PRN (as needed) as needed for seizure.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 15644**] Long Term Health - [**Location (un) 47**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Subarachnoid hemorrhage Atrial fibrillation Urinary tract infection acute hepatitis coagulopathy   Discharge Condition: Comfort measures only.
Responding intermittently to sternal rub with periods of apnea followed by tachypnea.
As a result of your fall, we found on CT scan that you had bleeding in your head, called a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Due to further worsening of your mental status and changes in your respiratory pattern, the decision was made to discontinue aggressive care and to focus on comfort measures.
Please use morphine concentrate sublingual solution as needed for pain and ativan IM for any seizure activity.
