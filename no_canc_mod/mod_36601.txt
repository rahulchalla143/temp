Admission Date:  [**2107-9-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2107-9-19**]   Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old white male who was initially evaluated by the trauma service on the [**8-25**] after a fall on the commode.
At that time, he was noted to have multiple rib fractures and a small splenic lac.
He was readmitted on [**9-6**], brought in via the [**Last Name (un) 4068**] ER, for lethargy and hypotension into the 80s/50s.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No use of tobacco or alcohol.
He had a distended and tense abdomen.
He had bilateral right greater than left lower extremity edema.
This was consistent with his previous history of especially right-sided elephantiasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The gentleman was taken to the operating room on the [**9-7**] and had an exploratory laparotomy, during which was noted a large splenic bleed.
He had no other internal injuries noted.
He had a left subclavian and Swan-Ganz catheter placed secondary to decreasing urine output and rising creatinine preoperatively.
The Swan-Ganz catheter was removed by [**9-8**], secondary to hemodynamic stabilization.
He remained afebrile on cefazolin and Levaquin.
His NG tube was DC'd on [**9-9**], and he was taking small amounts of clear liquids without nausea or vomiting in the unit.
On the floor, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have a moderate amount of abdominal distention with tympany.
He had no abdominal pain and no nausea.
There was also some serous drainage noted from the site of the left groin Cordis that had been pulled, but this resolved over the next several days.
He reported that he was passing flatus, but had had no bowel movement in many days.
A KUB was checked on [**9-12**] which just showed nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of obstruction or perforation.
His amylase was 51, indicating no sign of pancreatic injury or inflammation.
TSH was checked to see if inadequate treatment of his hypothyroidism might be contributing to his ileus, and it turned out to be 13.
He had a small bowel movement on that day, the [**9-12**], but still remained quite distended.
His distention did not resolve by the following day, so a PO and IV contrast abdominal CT was obtained in order to determine if there was sign of obstruction or abscess.
The CT from the 21 showed no focally drainable collections, no findings to suggest bowel obstruction, a small amount of abdominopelvic ascites consistent with ex-lap, and mild distention of the gallbladder without any discrete fluid around it, and with some calculi.
Since there was no indication or obstruction or abscess, and the patient was still tolerating POs, it was assumed that this distention and lack of bowel movements was probably due to ileus.
He was placed on [**Hospital1 **] lactulose which caused him to have several large quantity bowel movements, and so the lactulose was discontinued.
The patient required occasional albuterol nebs in order to treat some mild expiratory wheezes.
Lower extremity and scrotal edema improved with lasix.
The patient was noted to be very weak and continued to require PT and assist with ambulation.
His UA was positive which was why he was placed on Levaquin for 3 days for the urinary tract infection  DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.
Heparin 5,000 U subcu q 12 h.  FOLLOW-UP in 2 weeks with Trauma Clinic.
