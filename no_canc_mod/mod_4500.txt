He notes that over the past 2 days he developed acute onset loose stools and malaise.
He did not have abdominal cramping or pain, no n/v or anorexia.
Given that these symptoms persistent into sunday, he consulted with a physician covering the PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] suggested he be evaluated in the ED.
EKG notable for TwI II, TwF in III and IVCD with Qw in II, III, unchanged from prior.
Of note, patient has had multiple admissions for hypoxemia.
This was felt to be multifactorial (COPD exacerbations vs. effusion vs. CHF).
He had a Right sided pleural effusion chronically, tapped on [**2107-2-9**], cytology negative, 4+PMN with no growth.
He apparently had a reaccumulation of the effusion s/p tap.

He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

Chronic moderate non-hemorrhagic right pleural effusion has grown from small-to-moderate in volume with attendant progression of substantial rounded atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobes.
No left pleural effusion, pericardial effusion or ascites in the upper abdomen.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, severe coronary atherosclerotic calcification.
Possible thyroiditis and/or hypothyroidism.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers; however cannot definitively exclude particularly since images were suboptimal.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**8-2**] PCXR: Moderate to large, non-dependent right pleural effusion has increased following removal of right pleural drains.
There is no longer a small pneumothorax at the base of the right lung.
Mediastinal widening due to a combination of lipomatosis and mild adenopathy is unchanged.
Right pleural tissue, thoracoscopy (A-C): Dense fibrous tissue with chronic inflammation and reactive changes.
Right visceral pleural rind, thoracoscopy (D): Fibrovascular tissue with acute and chronic inflammation.
Right visceral parietal pleural rind, thoracoscopy (E-G): Fibroadipose tissue with acute and chronic inflammation.
CCP IgG negative  Brief Hospital Course: 66M with longstanding PMH of COPD, R pleural effusion presents with hypoxia and R sided pleural effusion.
S/P diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis, c/b pneumothorax requiring urgent placement of R pigtail catheter.
Following drainage of the Right pleural effusion he was admitted to the MICU for persistent hypoxia.
# Pleural Effusion/Pneumothorax A CT chest showed evidence of increase in size of the known R sided pneumothorax, and Interventional Pulmonology was consulted.
They performed a diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis, unfortunately complicated by formation of a sizable pneumothorax.
His ROMI was indeterminate but was downtrending, with enzymes suggestive of myocardial strain, which could be from chronic hypoxemia.
A TTE on [**7-26**] showed preserved EF and overall normal systolic function, and a repeat Echo with bubble study on [**8-2**] also showed preserved EF and no ASD/PFO.
# PUMP: There is currently little evidence of acute CHF flare, pt's weight is the same as in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year.
He presented with no pedal edema, and coarse crackles on lung exam in presence of slightly larger effusion.
Pt's measurement of EF 40% was on TEE performed intraop during AAA repair and aortic cross clamping.
A TTE on [**7-26**] showed preserved EF and overall normal systolic function, and a repeat Echo with bubble study on [**8-2**] also showed preserved EF and no ASD/PFO.
In the MICU, the pt was given lasix and the pt was diuresed 1700mL after which his R pleural effusion on CXR appeared slightly improved.
# Hypoxemia.
Initially suspected to be related to either COPD flare (soft call, progressive and only increasing cough frequency) or due to worsening effusion (he does tend to desat more when supine and on L side).
The etiology of the pleural effusion was unclear, but the results of studies show an exudate.
Further interventional management may prove difficult if lung does not re-expand [**3-9**] cortication, may involve thoracic surgery input for VATS, especially in the setting of his history of asbestos exposure during construction work in his early youth.
The hypoxemia was not considered to be due to pneumonia and antibiotics were not started.
# Bloody loose stools.
The Pt has not had any bloody bowel movements since admission, suggesting that his BRBPR is at least not severe melena.
He was placed on a CIWA scale with diazepam Q2hrs as needed for CIWA >10, but in the MICU did not display and signs or symptoms of EtOH withdrawal.
# Thoracic Surgery: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room on [**2107-7-29**] for Right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical total pulmonary decortication and parietal pleurectomy.
He had high oxygen requirements initally which decreased with aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs ambulation and good pain control.
Serial chest films showed improving right lower lobe effusion.
# Transitional Issues - continuing torsemide for continued diuresis - CPAP at night - wound care for prior pigtail catheters as described - please check electrolytes on Friday, [**8-5**].
Indication - diuresis - f/u appts with specialists as noted above  Medications on Admission: DIAZEPAM - 5 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day this medication can cause sedation/confusion.
7. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: COPD Pleural Effusion Congestive Heart Failure Coronary Artery disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of your shortness of breath and pleural effusion.
Your symptoms were likely due to a combination of your COPD and pleural effusion.
You had a bedside drainage of your effusion, and required a drainage catheter to help keep the air out of your chest.
Once you recovered you were stable for discharge.
You had fluid removed from your lungs with diuretic medications.
