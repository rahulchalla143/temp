2) Cholelithiasis, wall edema and thickening commonly associated with cirrhosis.
The diaphragms are somewhat elevated and there are small effusions and mild bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
There is no bone destruction.
IMPRESSION: There is no significant change in the chest since [**2166-4-3**].
There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral areas of consolidation consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
No thrombosis identified.
The main portal vein also demonstrates hepatopetal blood flow.
3) Liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension.
No suspicious liver masses identified.
4) Moderate amount of abdominal ascites.
5) Patchy bibasilar lung opacities.
Clinical correlation is recommended, as these opacities may be secondary to dependent atelectasis versus a bibasilar infectious process.
Bilateral pleural effusion with marked bilateral opacities in the lungs, probably representing pulmonary edema.
Superimposed multifocal pneumonia should be considered in this patient with fever.
If the patient has hemoptysis, diffuse hemorrhage is also a consideration.
Right paratracheal lymph node measuring 12 mm in short axis.
Atrophic liver, splenomegaly, ascites and lateral collateral vessels in this patient with end-stage liver disease.
CXR [**4-30**]:  IMPRESSION: Marked improvement in bilateral lower lobe consolidations with only faint residual reticular opacity seen in these regions.
Improved congestive failure compared to the most recent study of [**2166-4-27**].
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 46**] is a 36 year old male with cirrhosis secondary to HCV, hemochromatosis, and renal disease, who presented with increasing abdominal girth and abdominal pain x 2 wks.
1) Liver Failure/Ascites:  The patient presented with a worsening MELD score pushing him further up the transplant list.
An abdominal U/S on admission showed good portal and hepatic vein flow without clot, but severe ascites.
The plan initially was for large volume paracentesis, however he was found to be in acute renal failure as well (see below), therefore he was given albumin and a diagnostic paracentesis was performed instead.
There was no evidence for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
His diuretics (lasix and aldactone) were held given his acute renal failure, and he unfortunately subsequently experienced steady accumulation of peripheral edema and ascites.
His renal failure persisted despite holding lasix, and he was eventually transferred to the SICU for initiation of CVVHD and removal of fluid with lasix drip under a more controlled setting.
In the SICU he had a therapeutic paracentesis and received CVVHD with massive improvement in his edema and ascites.
His MELD remained high because of having received CVVHD, necessitating inpatient monitoring, and his mental status was borderline encephalopathic at times.
He was discharged on 1 mg Bumex daily, and 50 mg spironolatone [**Hospital1 **], as well as cipro 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] for SBP prophylaxis, and lactulose.
2) Acute renal failure:  On admission he was noted to have a marked increase in creatinine from a baseline of 1.2 to 2.7.
Initially it was thought to be pre-renal from his liver disease and aggressive outpatient diuresis, however his creatinine did not improve with holding diuretics and giving albumin.
Additionally, he was never oliguric as would be seen with pre-renal failure or hepatorenal syndrome.
Given that hepatorenal syndrome was in the differential, however, he was started on midodrine and octreotide.
His creatinine had actually begun to improve prior to transfer to the SICU, down to 2.2, however it was slow and his edema was increasing, therefore he was transfered to the SICU for CVVHD and diuresis.
His acute renal failure is thought to have been secondary to ATN, which has resolved.
He was restarted on diuretics, and will need to have his renal function monitored to avoid further episodes of ATN (likely secondary to pre-renal state).
3) PNA: Mr. [**Known lastname 46**] presented with dyspnea, thought initially to be secondary to his large ascites - he had dullness at the bases of his lungs, with decreased air entry.
However, he became progressively hypoxic, to the point where he required up to 2 L to keep his oxygen saturation above 90%, and a repeat CXR suggested bibasilar infiltrates.
He had a BAL in the SICU which unfortunately didn't have any growth, therefore broad spectrum abx were continued.
4) Hyponatremia:  Secondary to liver disease.
His hyponatremia resolved with holding diuretics and giving albumin.
5) Anemia:  His hematocrit has fluctuated greatly over the last few months, generally anywhere between 24 and 33.
An EGD showed possibly a small esophageal varix, and portal hypertensive gastropathy.
A colonoscopy showed internal hemorrhoids.
His anemia is an anemia of chronic inflammation.
