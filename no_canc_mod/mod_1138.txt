Approximately one week ago the patient was noted to have a decreased appetite and not quite feeling herself.
2 days ago the patient had a stomach ache and vomitted twice.
Thursday morning the pt woke with severe shaking and chills.
Past Medical History: Uveittis Cataracts HTN Sarcoid ?
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

RUQ U/S FINDINGS: The liver shows no focal or textural abnormalities.
The gallbladder is distended but not tense and no stones or sludge are seen within the gallbladder.
If clinical suspicion remains, a HIDA scan or repeat ultrasound could be performed to document resolution of this pathology.
Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidations.
One-centimeter obstructing stone in the right mid ureter with proximal ureteral dilatation and right hydronephrosis.
Echo Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly elongated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Mild aortic sclerosis.
Prominent bilateral pleural effusions.
Very small circumferential pericardial effusion.
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation does not exclude the diagnosis of endocarditis.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
No evidence of endocarditis.
No intracranial hemorrhage, evidence of stroke, or mass effect.
Mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid and mastoid sinuses.
RUE U/S IMPRESSION: No right upper extremity DVT.
CT Abd MPRESSION: 1) Multiple areas of low attenuation in the spleen likely representing multiple splenic infarctions.
Moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis.
Brief hospital course by problem:  1) Urosepsis/ID:  Pt transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH with urosepsis complicated by hypotension, respiratory distress and VT s/p code.
Pt found to have right hydronephrosis/pyelonephrosis with stalhorn stone; s/p nephrostomy tube placement.
Briefly maintained with stress steroids.
In response to contiued fevers, abd CT obtained showing splenic infartcs.
Total goal of treatment being 14 day for urosepsis and 14 day total course of Vanco for MRSA (started [**8-14**]).
Pt is to follow up with Urology, appt made for [**9-10**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9125**], after completion of ABx to discuss management of renal stone and status of nephrostomy tube.
Return to AC since Pt became somewhat unstable cardiac wise (see below).
Cardiology consulted on [**8-12**] for tachy/brady syndrome with junctional escapes as well as NSTEMI.
Pt with peak trop of 0.23, most likely demand ischemia in response to hypotension.
If so they believed that she would be a good candidate for EPS with SVT ablation +/- pacer if Pt did not recover after urosepsis resolved.
During the remaining stay, Pt without evidence of continued ischemia or tachy-brady syndrome.
Pt should have stress-MIBI as an outpateint to better evaluate cardiac function.
4) GU: Pt with one-centimeter obstructing stone in the right mid ureter with proximal ureteral dilatation and right hydronephrosis, requiring nephrostomy tube placed by IR.
At time of discharge, nephrostomy tube draining well without problems.
Pt is to follow up with Urology, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9383**] [**9-10**], for nephrostomy tube managment as well as decision regarding surgical or lithotripsy for renal stone treatment.
Pt felt weak and per PT, it was felt appropriate for Pt to have a short term rehab stay upon discharge.
Diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pruritis.
Disp:*135 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: urosepsis nephrolithiasis cardiac ischemia respiratory failure hypertension   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Please call PCP or return to ED if fever greater than 101, chills, persistent nausea or vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquid, severe back/side pain, chest pain or shortness of breath.
