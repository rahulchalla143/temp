Coarsened liver echotexture without focal lesions.
History of liver failure with decreased breath sounds and fever.
No evidence for CHF.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Probable associated atelectasis at the right lung base but no definite pulmonary consolidation.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions and right basilar ill-defined opacity, consistent with atelectasis.
Liver ultrasound [**7-18**]: INDICATION: Fulminant liver failure with new fever.
FINDINGS: The liver again demonstrates no focal or textural abnormalities.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic ductal dilatation.
There is no perihepatic ascites.
The gallbladder is unremarkable without evidence of stones.
The right kidney is imaged measuring approximately 12.9 cm with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the right upper quadrant with no evidence of ductal dilatation.
Endoscopy: Changes suggestive of portal hypertensive gastropathy in the fundus.
Grade III esophogitis in the gastroesophageal junction, lower third of the esophagus and middle third of the esophagus   Brief Hospital Course: 44 yo w/hx of SA and alcohol abuse presents with acute hepatic failure with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and coffee grounds emesis intubated for AMS likely [**2-4**] hepatic encephalopathy, originally thought to require liver transplant, extubated and with clinical improvement with decreasing LFTs.
Fulminant hepatic failure.
Patient's fulminant hepatic failure was likely secondary to alcohol and acetominophen overdose.
He exhibited no signs of hepatic encephalopathy.
His toxicology screens were all negative, except for a positive urine acetominophen level prior to his transfer from an OSH.
Patient had persistent RUQ to light palpation, as well as an alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin which remained elevated for a period of several days.
In the context of jaundice, RUQ pain, and low grade fever, there was a concern for ascending cholangitis or cholecystitis.
Patient received a gallbladder ultrasound, which was negative for obstruction.
It was felt that the low grade fever was likely secondary to pneumonia vs. recovering alcoholic hepatitis, and his RUQ resolved over the course of several days.
Patient has a history of severe alcohol abuse, with >6 drinks/day, with no history of DTs, seizures, or withdrawal.
Patient had history of depression with suicidality, and it is thought that this admission was due to a suicide attempt.
A psychiatry consult was obtained, and it was recommended that patient have a one-to-one sitter, and be transferred to psychiatry when medically stable.
Patient had a history of bloody emesis per his family's report, as well as coffee grounds emesis in the OSH ER.
He had continued dysphagia throughout his stay, relieved by Maalox, and on discharge, was able to eat with minimal dysphagia.
His endoscopy showed Grade III esophagitis with no bleeding in the gastroesophageal junction, as well as changes suggestive of portay hypertensive gastropathy.
He was continued on his PPI, and is to follow up for a repeat endoscopy in [**1-5**] years to rule out Barrett's esophagus.
Patient had wheezing on exam, and episodes of desaturation, which resolved with use of albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers, and albuterol inhalers.
His CXR showed patchy atelectasis at the bases, and patient was encouraged to use his nebulizers and incentive spirometer.
Patient had a low grade fever on HOD6, thought to be secondary to alcoholic hepatitis, pneumonia, or UTI.
His CXR showed a questionable right basilar ill-defined opacity consistent with atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
He continued to have low-grade fevers, which resolved after three days of antibiotic treatment.
He required fluid boluses initially, but on discharge, was able to take po intake with no problems.
