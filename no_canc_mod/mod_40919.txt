Carotid bruit murmur radiated to bilateral carotids heard.
The patient was taken to the operating room with a preoperative diagnosis of 1) progressive aortic insufficiency, 2) new left ventricular dilatation, and 3) progressive fatigue.
Findings intraoperatively showed a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve with fusion of the right and noncoronary cusps.
At that time, the patient's hematocrit was 30.4; however, the patient had an acute hematocrit drop on postoperative day #2 to 19 with a concurrent pneumothorax seen on chest x-ray.
The patient maintained saturations at 98% on room air, however, was kept on oxygen for prophylactic therapy, and chest tube was elected not to be placed because of the patient's clinical and stable status.
Chest x-ray showed resolving pneumothorax.
On postoperative day #4, the patient was transfused 3 U of blood and continued to have oxygen saturations at 98% on room air.
