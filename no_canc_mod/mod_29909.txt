There is surrounding adjacent edema and significant mass effect, with shift of the midline.
There appears to be a subfalcine herniation, and compression of the right lateral ventricle and associated compression of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, with mild dilatation of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and temporal horns of the left lateral ventricle.
No intraventricular or extraaxial hemorrhage is identified.
There is no evidence of cerebellar tonsillar herniation.
IMPRESSION: There is a large 8.9 x 5.4 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage, centered within the right basal ganglia and right frontal and parietal regions, with significant mass effect and leftward shift of normally midline structures.
There is partial effacement of the interpeduncular cistern.
Performed because the patient had fallen: CT C-SPINE: No fracture or spondylolisthesis is identified.
There is extensive degenerative change at multiple levels.
No prevertebral soft tissue swelling is seen.
Within the visualized portion of lung apices, no pneumothorax is seen.
Biapical increased pulmonary markings are noted.
There are hypodensities within both lobes of the thyroid, which are not completely characterized.
No fracture or malalignment is identified.
Degenerative change seen at multiple levels.
There is mild hyperinflation of the ET tube cuff.
There is mild upper lung zone redistribution, however, this may be related to position.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
The pacemaker is seen overlying the left hemithorax with leads positioned overlying the right atrium and ventricle.
There is an overlying trauma board, which obscures underlying structures, however, no definite fractures are identified.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 84 yo woman with history of hypertension, high cholesterol, heart disease status post pacemaker, and "borderline diabetes," who was admitted to the [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center after being found down in the bathroom by her daughter with a left facial droop and slurring her speech.
She was found to have a very large subcortical hemorrhage (>100cc) with subfalcine herniation and effacement of the basilar cistern.
By morning, her pupils remained fixed, with no signs of brainstem activity, absent deep tendon reflexes throughout.
Due to the very poor overall prognosis with this intracranial hemorrhage, thought potentially related to either hypertension, or an underlying lesion (vascular or less likely, neoplastic), her family decided to change the goal to comfort care.
Exam at the time showed fixed pupils at 3mm, midline, no spontaneous heart sounds or breath sounds, absent brainstem reflexes, absent deep tendon reflexes.
