FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled "erect" with excessive lordotic positioning, is compared with semi-upright study dated [**2200-4-27**].
There is more marked cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion and blurring, indicative of interstitial edema, as well as right greater than left pleural effusions.
There is no overt alveolar edema or focal consolidation.
Airspace opacity at the right lung base likely represents a combination of atelectasis and effusion; pneumonic consolidation at this site cannot be excluded.
IMPRESSION: CHF with right effusion and right basilar atelectasis, significantly worse since [**2200-4-27**].
