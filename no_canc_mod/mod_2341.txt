Admission Date:  [**2177-10-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2177-10-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2117-5-16**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Squeezing chest pain and dizziness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 60-year-old man with history of coronary artery disease status post MI in [**2165**], RCA stent in [**2170**] for a 90% mid stenosis of the RCA who was admitted on [**6-3**] for chest pain.
Dobutamine MIBI at that time revealed a partially reversible inferior defect without any EKG changes or symptoms during the exam.
No intervention was done as patient refused and he was managed medically.
The chest pain was associated with nausea, diaphoresis and dizziness.
He also had worsening shortness of breath at the time.
The pain did not radiate anywhere.
Shortly thereafter he was found to be in sinus bradycardia with a rate in the 30s with stable blood pressure and worsening O2 saturation to the 70s.
He was diuresed with Lasix for symptoms of heart failure.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2165**] and RCA stent in [**2170**].
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home O2.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission he was afebrile at 97.3 F.  Blood pressure was 116/65, heart rate 78, respiratory rate 22 and he was saturating at 94% on six liters by nasal cannula.
He had a very dry oral mucosa.
Heart exam had a distant S1, S2 with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
His abdomen was obese, soft and nontender without hepatic enlargement.
Extremities had 2+ pitting edema bilaterally with preserved DP pulses.
His digits were cyanotic and he had changes of chronic venous stasis.
Chest x-ray revealed low lung volumes, mild interstitial edema, bilateral lower lobe opacities resembling atelectasis versus consolidation.
EKG was sinus at 80 beats per minute with a first degree AV block, right axis deviation, Q waves in V1 through V3 and RV strain pattern likely secondary to his chronic lung disease.
he had [**Hospital1 **]-atrial abnormalities as well.
Telemetry from the bradycardic event in the Emergency Department revealed sinus bradycardia at 38 beats per minute.
It was poor quality study, however not ruling out focal wall motion abnormalities.
The patient's bradycardia was thought to be due to either a vagal episode induced by hypoxemia or induced by recurrent right coronary artery disease.
He had no further episodes of bradycardia during hospitalization.
His beta blocker was held because of his bradycardia.
He was taken to the Cath Lab on [**2177-10-28**] because of his inability to lie flat.
Cath revealed elevated right sided pressures with a pulmonary artery pressure of 61/34 and a mean of 46.
Coronary angiography revealed a patent RCA stent, 50% OM2 lesion and 40% proximal LAD lesion.
It was felt that his bradycardia was not cardiac in origin.
More than likely it was due to a hypoxemic event as his O2 saturation was found to be in the 70s when the event occurred and hypoxemia may have lead to a vagal response causing his bradycardia and subsequent symptoms of dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea.
Because of his preserved ejection fraction, it was felt that he did not require afterload reduction to the degree that he had prior to admission.
PULMONARY:  Patient has a long standing history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Upon admission it was felt that perhaps he was having an acute flare of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and was given Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department 100 mg.
HEMATOLOGY:  Patient's hematocrit on admission was 51.9 and felt likely to be due to chronic hypoxemia and compensation for that.
ENDOCRINE:  While on steroids for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, the patient was covered with an insulin sliding scale.
Symptomatic bradycardia.
Coronary artery disease status post MI and RCA stent.
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
