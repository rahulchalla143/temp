Admission Date:  [**2135-2-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-3-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-9-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Augmentin / Levaquin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2499**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old female with a history of stage IIIA NSCLC s/p lobectomy, radiation, chemotherapy [**10-20**] and remote history of breast cancer as well as worsening chronic SOB who presented to outpatient hem/onc clinic on [**2-24**] with worsening SOB.
Since [**2134-6-17**] she has had progressive dyspnea and has seen Dr.  [**Doctor Last Name 2168**] to w/u this process (per husband, breathing has not been the same since lobectomy).
And has had a bronch [**8-/2134**] negative for malignancy; + atypical cells suggestive of post-XRT change however; Cx + for MAC (grew out after 1 month).
She developed SOB and pleuritic chest pain in middle of [**Month (only) 1096**] and was admitted from [**Date range (1) 104003**] and found to have a large pericardial effusion which required emergent pericardiocentesis.
Since the patient was discharged from the hospital she has been SOB at rest with very limited ambulation and on O2 at all times.
2 weeks ago went to OSH ED with SOB and was diagnosed with pericarditis, unclear treatment.
CXR was done which showed RML opacity and bilateral effusions.
She was discharged home on doxycylcine but represented to [**Hospital1 18**] for second opinion.
She was seen in clinic and d/t respiratory distress was had CT of chest which showed new PNA in RUL and increasing bilateral effusions.
She initially came to the floor and ABG demonstrated chronic respiratory acidosis with compensation.
Serial ABG's showed worsening hypoxia and hypercarbia, she become more somnolent, and was transferred to MICU.
Past Medical History: PMHx: # Right lower lobe lung CA - found incidentally in [**2132**] on a preoperative chest x-ray in anticipation of surgery for a ductal carcinoma - Resected [**2132-10-17**], path: stage IIIa T2, N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer - s/p 3 cycles of adjuvant carboplatin and Taxol, complicated by  thrombocytopenia and anemia.
- serial CTs concerning for malignancy recurrence - [**1-22**]: CT with RML consolidation/effusion with PET-CT showing increased PET avidity - underwent CT guided aspiration of this consolidation, the cytology and cultures were negative, no AFB was sent.
- [**7-22**]: CT with progressive cavitation in R lower lung field along with atelectasis and bronchiectasis - [**8-22**]: Bronch: Negative cytology, no micro - [**8-22**]: induced sputum MAC+, s/p 2 weeks levo - [**12-23**]: Sputum with MAC, no treatment # Right breast cancer, s/p lumpectomy and radiation therapy in [**2111**] - Ductal cancer diagnosed [**2132**], s/p lumpectomy alone #.
MDS # GERD # Urinary urgency # Anxiety # Hypertension # Leg cramps # Status post left knee surgery   Social History: The patient is married, with 3 kids and lives in [**Hospital3 **].

CT [**2135-2-24**]: IMPRESSION:  New pneumonia in the upper lobes.
Mild increase mediastinal node size, probably reactive.
Decreased pericardial effusion.
Stable radiation fibrosis in the right middle lobe and anterior segment of left upper lobe.
Increased left nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion.
There is a small partially echodense pericardial effusion.
[**2135-2-27**] CXR: Again noted is right-sided volume loss with associated increased opacity involving the right lung pulmonary parenchyma, unchanged.
Bilateral pleural effusions persist.
No pneumothorax detected.
Bibasilar atelectasis is present.
No interval change.
Calcified granuloma is again noted in the left lung apex.
Left perihilar opacity remains similar in appearance.
An ABG was significant for a significant respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis that appeared to be more chronic in nature.
Given the history of the pt taking Ativan everytime she felt short of breath since her prior admission, this was thought to be the primary cause of her respiratory acidosis, especially as the pt was not tachypneic on physical exam.
She was placed on IV vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin to broadly cover for a nosocomial PNA that was visualized on CXR and CT on admission.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] overnight on hospital day 1 given concern for increasing somnolence and PCO2.
She also underwent a L thoracocentesis that was not significant for an empyema and cytology was negative for malignant cells.
It was thought that the pt's SOB on presentation was likely multi-factorial including chronic issues of radiation changes, lobectomy, restrictive disease on PFTs, and possibly cancer.
More acute worsening was though to be due to her bilateral effusions and PNA.
Chronic hypoventilation in setting of overuse of benzos was also a large contributor to the chronic respiratory acidosis with a degree of compensation as well as more acute metabolic alkalosis d/t dehydration.
Her coumadin was initially held on presentation due to a supratherapeutic INR but was restarted once she was transferred back to the floor.
Diltiazem 30 mg qid was also added for increased rate control with good effect.
Prior to discharge, the pt was also diuresed a total of 3L for fluid overload noted on examination.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: Two (2) puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Shortness of breath or wheezing.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for shortness of breath and were found to have a pneumonia and were not breathing well secondary to overmedication with ativan.
You were started on several new medications, including Remeron for anxiety, and Diltiazem for heart rate control.
Please take only 0.5 mg every 6 hours as needed for anxiety.
Call ([**2135**] if you have further questions.
