There are no focal areas of consolidation .
[**2148-6-27**] Lower Extremity Doppler: 1) No DVT.
Cirrhotic liver with gallbladder wall edema and distention.
This might be related to third spacing, chronic liver disease, and enteric status--please correlate clinically as to whether there is abdominal pain which may be attributable to the gallbladder.

There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Large volume abdominal ascites, similar in appearance to study from [**1-2**], 09.

Patient presents with fevers, tachycardia, hypotension in the setting of end stage liver disease.
Urinalysis negative.
No evidence of SBP on paracentesis.
He never required pressors or central line placement.

TEE was negative for vegitations.
Colonoscopy was negative and no source of GI etiology of bacteremia was found.
One month course was recommended by ID since no etiology of bacteremia had been found.
EKG Changes: No complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.
Likely related to demand in the setting of profound tachycardia and hypotension.

During colonoscopy, Mr. [**Known lastname 19420**] had runs of SVT with no electrolyte changes.
He was monitored overnight after colonoscopy and had no further telemetry events.
Hepatorenal Syndrome: Recent admission for acceleration of hepatorenal syndrome requiring octreotide and midodrine with Cr of 3.8.
He had mild worsening creatine likely secondary to hyperperfusion in the setting of infection.
No evidence of GI bleeding or peritonitis.

Of concern was the finding of mild RV dilitation.
Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease: Secondary to alcohol abuse and hepatitis C. Currently on [**Known lastname **] list.
No evidence of SBP on paracentesis from emergency room.
He was encephalopathic on arrival but this has improved with IV hydration.

Sepsis 2.
Hepatorenal Syndrome 3.
Hepatic encephalopaty  SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1.
End Stage Liver Disease secondary to ETOH abuse and Hepatitis C   Discharge Condition: Mental Status back to baseline per mother.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 **] hospital on [**2148-6-26**] with fevers and low blood pressure.
You had bacteria growing in your blood so you were started on antibiotics.
There was no evidence of a clot.
We took cultures of your urine and the fluid in your abdomen, but there was no bacteria growing in either of these yet.
On the chest X-ray, there was no sign of pneumonia.
There was no source in your GI tract when we did a CT scan, so we did a colonoscopy to take a closer look.
It is unclear what the source of the bacteria in your blood is at this point.
We tested your heart enzymes, which showed that you were not having a heart attack, and your EKG changes resolved when repeated.
You had some abnormal rhythm on the heart monitor while you had your colonoscopy, but it resolved.
Your kidney failure is due to your liver failure.
Please return to the ER or call your doctor if you experience a change in mental status, confusion, dizziness, shortness of breath, weight gain, chest pain, fevers/chills, abdominal pain, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
