He has also noted increased wheezing.
He became more short of breath over last night, and restarted his home O2 at that time without improvement.
The patient denies fever, cough, chest pain, sputum production, rhinorrhea, orthopnea, PND, or increased leg swelling.
He was noted to have LLL ronchi and was using his accessory muscles to breath.
CXR revealed a left mid lung field PNA.
CTA was negative for PE but did show intralobular septal thickening c/w edema or lymphangitic spread.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p silent IMI; no prior interventions - Hypercholesterolemia - Hypertension - CHF, systolic, EF 30% by echo (Echo [**2150-2-26**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately-to-severely depressed(ejection fraction 30 percent)secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferior free wall and akinesis of the posterior (inferolateral) wall; the rest of the left ventricle also appears at least mildly hypokinetic) - COPD - H/o actinic keratosis s/p cryotherapy [**2-/2150**] - Seborrheic Keratosis - H/o T1N0M0 NSCLC s/p L superior segmentectomy [**10/2147**] - New lung nodule on CT of [**2149-12-30**]: surveillance CT in [**2149-12-3**] identified a new right lower lobe nodule which was found to be FDG PET avid.
The cytology from this examination was unrevealing, however, the bronchoalveolar lavage grew an atypical mycobacterium, Mycobacterium kansasii.
Subsequently, he had two induced sputa which were negative with no growth.
- BPH - Schatzki's Ring - Dementia not yet fully worked up; per PCP notes pt has been refusing head imaging to eval for mets - Silent aspiration per video swallow eval in [**3-10**]   Social History: Denies tobacco use; quit smoking 15 yrs ago; There is a history of alcohol abuse but he states he now abstains.
Family History: His father "dropped dead" of a heart attack in his 50's.
To his knowledge, there is no history of cancer in his family.
Pulm: Decreased breath sounds in the left mid-lower fields.
No masses or organomegaly.
New basal intralobular septal thickening and somewhat nodular interstitial prominence along with more scattered indistinct opacities bilaterally.
Diagnostic considerations include pulmonary edema, lymphangitic spread of malignancy, and infection.
Left greater than right small pleural effusions.
Consolidation in the mid left lung field is new as are increased interstitial markings in the right lower lobe.
There is no pneumothorax or sizable pleural effusions.
A/P: 68 y/o M w/ h/o CAD, COPD, NSCLC s/p L superior segmentectomy in [**2147**], systolic dysfunction (EF 30%), recently started on home O2, who presented with hypoxic respiratory distress and PNA.
# Hypoxia.
The patient has a history of COPD, NSCLC s/p lobectomy in [**2147**], and silent aspiration.
He also is known to have atypical mycobacteria in the lung, thought to be colonization.
He describes poor understanding of using continuous home oxygen and has signs of left middle lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray.
Given pts wheezing and progressive SOB, he seems to be having a COPD flare in the setting of an apparent PNA.
Also of question is the septal thickening on CT concerning for lymphangitic carcinoma.
Sputum culture and blood cultures are without growth.
The patient's case was reviewed with his primary thoracic oncologist.
He will follow-up with a repeat chest CT within the next 2 months for further evaluation of intralobular septal thickening.
# Neurologic.
Dementia, incontinence, gait disturbance and silent aspiration described in recent primary care notes.
Differential includes Alzheimer's, normal pressure hydrocephalus, late stage syphilis and microvascular disease.
Less likely is  metastatic disease.
Syphilis screening negative.
The patient had a complaint of 2 episodes of lightheadedness and change in vision.
These episodes lasted for seconds and were associated with turning of the head to the right.
The patient was NOT able to reproduce the symptoms on exam now did he have any other focal neurologic deficits.
He had no carotid bruits.
addition of other antiplatelet agents).
He had no further episodes >36 hours after these 2 isolated episodes on a single morning.
# H/o silent Aspiration.
The patient had a repeat speech and swallow evaluation.
# Leukocytosis.
The patient developed a leukocytosis in the setting of steroid use.
At that time the patient had no new signs of focal infection.
# Diarrhea.
The patient had an episode of diarrhea within hours of discharge.
If this persists at his extended care facility off of stool softeners than a sample should be sent for C. Diff testing.
# Pulmonary nodules.
Thought to be due to aspiration event(s).
Repeat outpatient CT scan to monitor for resolution.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: community-acquired and/or aspiration pneumonia COPD exacerbation  Coronary artery disease History of non-small cell lung cancer probable dementia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath and hypoxia (low oxygen in the blood).
This was likely due to pneumonia and a CHF exacerbation.
You had 2 episodes of lightheadedness while in the hospital.
Call your doctor or return to the hospital for new or worsening fevers, chills, nightsweats, shortness of breath, productive cough, confusion, dizziness or lightheadedness or any other concerning symptoms.
