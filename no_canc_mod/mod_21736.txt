pt of Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with h/o silent MI in [**2145**], DM, HTN, with known 2 vessel disease by OSH cath report transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for a possible intervention.
The patient was admitted to the OSH on [**2147-4-9**] with a one-week history of nausea and non-bilious non-bloody vomiting.
The patient also describes symtpoms of fatigue and malaise over the last week.
She describes episodes of intermittent shortness of breath with associated left sided chest pain that would frequently happen at rest.
She describes left sided chest pain as sharp, lasting "minutes", localized over left shoulder and radiating to left upper arm, pain would change with change in arm position.
She was given SL NTG with resolution of her symptoms.
She ruled out MI with three sets of enzymes.
On [**2147-4-10**] she underwent p-MIBI which showed inferior ischemia/no infarct.
Patient had stents to LAD placed on [**2147-4-13**].
During the procedure she developed CP/nausea with 2mm ST elevations in inferior leads, became bradycardic and was given atropine and dopamine.
Following the procedure she ruled in for myocardial infarction by enzymes but was symptomatically stable until early morning [**2147-4-15**] when she developed acute chest pain with EKG changes.
In the cath lab, she was found to have thrombus in her LAD.Export catheter was used to remove the clot when she started having EMD.
It was then decided that she might have had coronary spasm and showering of emboli.
Echocardiogram was done and ruled out pericardial tamponade but anterior wall AK.

Prox LAD lesion could not be crossed with Cyphher stents and two 2.5x12mm overlapping Taxus stensts were placed.
This revealec mid LAD lesion that was underappreciated.
Pt had CP/nausea, 2mm ST elevations in inferior leads, became bradycardic and was given atropine and dopamine.
Mid LAD 2.5x8 cm Cypher stent with no residuaa and TIMI 3.
EKG (post-cath at OSH): rate 80, sinus, nl axis, nl intervals, no ischemic ST or TW changes, Q in III, aVF.
Echo [**2147-4-10**]: EF 60-65%; mild concentric LVH, trace MR. .
P-MIBI [**2147-4-10**]: HR 76->96; SBP 126/70-> 100/62, no chest pain or ST changes.
Mild exercise induced LV dilation and failure.
Inferior infarct No evidence of infarct.
CT [**2147-4-15**]: no retroperitoneal bleed .
She had polymorphic VT while in cath lab.
Her plavix was switched to ticlopidine since she developed in stent thrombosis while on plavix.
Beta blocker was held as she has severe bronchospasm.
On the day of her death, she developed respiratory distress and ventricular fibrillation.
Resuscitation effort was attempted without success.
