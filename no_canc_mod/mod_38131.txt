He was diagnosed with a heart murmur approximately 2 years ago and followed by serial echoes.
He is a very active 87-year-old and asymptomatic until approximately 1 month ago when he started to experience some exertional chest tightness and shortness of breath.
He underwent an echocardiogram on [**2121-5-29**] that showed an ejection fraction greater than 55% with an aortic valve area of less than 0.8 cm as well as some left ventricular hypertrophy.
Based on these findings, he underwent cardiac catheterization which showed no coronary artery disease and based on the findings from the echocardiogram, the patient was scheduled to undergo an aortic valve replacement.
The patient understood the risks and benefits of the procedure including, but not limited to, bleeding, infection, myocardial infarction, stroke, death, renal or pulmonary insufficiency as well as the possibility of blood transfusion and future revascularization procedures.

Please refer to operative note for surgical details.
He experienced some mild confusion which quickly resolved over the next 24 hours.
He remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm - one short burst of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia was noted on postoperative five.
Over several days, he continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis and made steady progress with physical therapy.
His oxygen saturations were 96% on room air and his discharge chest x-ray was notable for only small bilateral pleural effusions.
