Admission Date:  [**2110-7-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2110-8-11**]   Service:  MEDICINE/[**Location (un) 259**] FIRM  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old Russian-speaking male, with a history of atrial fibrillation, no anticoagulation per patient's wishes, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, who was admitted to [**Hospital6 256**] with progressive, diffuse lower abdominal pain.
The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis on [**7-1**] following completion of a course of clindamycin for lower extremity cellulitis.
The patient was treated with Flagyl 500 tid and ciprofloxacin for persistent cellulitis and superimposed C. difficile colitis.
The patient continued having diarrhea which was nonbloody, nonmucoid, one to two times a day.
The patient denies any fevers or chills, but complains of nausea, decreased po intake and dyspnea which has been the patient's baseline.
The patient's abdominal CAT scan showed severe pancolitis, no evidence of toxic megacolon, consistent with Clostridium difficile infection.
There was no concern for ongoing mesenteric ischemia.
A hoarse voice.
Neck - no jugulovenous distention.
Pulmonary - coarse breath sounds, bilateral wheezing in all fields.
Cardiovascular - irregularly irregular, distant heart sounds.
Abdomen - positive bowel sounds, distended but soft, diffusely tender to palpation mostly bilateral lower quadrant, no hepatosplenomegaly, no rebound, positive guarding.
Extremities - [**2-17**]+ lower extremity edema, superficial erythema, left lower extremity more than right lower extremity, no purulence or open wounds.
Chest x-ray - right lung base linear atelectasis.
Given dilaudid for pain control.
The patient was put on isolation precautions for C. difficile colitis with positive C. difficile toxin.
The patient was closely monitored for signs of toxic megacolon by serial abdominal exam and daily KUBs.
The patient was put on bowel rest and was decompressed with a nasogastric tube for one day, and with rectal tube for the duration of three days with interval improvement in colonic distention as evidenced by clinical exam and radiographic confirmation.
2) RESPIRATORY STATUS WITH OBJECTIVE DYSPNEA:  During the hospitalization, the patient had complained objectively of severe dyspnea.
However, the patient's oxygenation had remained normal, and ABG analysis showed no hypocarbia or hypoxia.
It was presumed that the patient likely had emphysema and this was chronic progression of his chronic lung disease.
However, there was no evidence of CO2 trapping.
There were no infiltrates on chest x-ray, and chest CT was performed which showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
This was attributed to likely mild congestive heart failure in light of interval decrease of ejection fraction, as was found during this admission by echocardiogram, which showed an ejection fraction of 40% which was an interval decrease from more than 55% in [**2106**].
The patient was also rate controlled for atrial fibrillation with diltiazem.
3) RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's renal failure had mostly a prerenal component and creatinine returned to a baseline of 1.6 with IV hydration.
Subsequently, the patient remained uvolemic, and his creatinine was followed closely when the patient was started on lasix for congestive heart failure.
The patient has a history of longstanding atrial fibrillation and presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on Lopressor.
6) HISTORY OF CELLULITIS:  The patient presented with resolved cellulitis and no antibiotics targeting cellulitis were continued in light of current Clostridium difficile superinfection.
7) NUTRITION:  The patient was put on bowel rest in light of severe dilation of transverse colon.
