There was no loss of consciousness, no evidence of head trauma.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2161**].
History of atrial fibrillation.
History of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
History of deep venous thrombosis in the upper extremity in [**2160**].
ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT STATES SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  She was alert, in no acute distress.
Lungs had rales at the bases bilaterally.
S1 and S2 normal with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best appreciated in the left upper sternal border.
Extremities, the right upper extremity had pain to palpation at the wrist, which was greater on the radial side.
There was decreased flexion and extension of the wrist secondary to pain.
There was pain to palpation in the anterior groin.
Initial x-rays revealed a intratrochanteric fracture of the right hip as well as a distal radial fracture of the right wrist, neither fracture was displaced.
The patient was initially admitted to the orthopedic service with a diagnosis of a right hip fracture as well as a right radial wrist fracture.
However, on postoperative day number 2, the patient was complaining of right foot pain and vascular surgery was consulted, the patient had a history of a distal bypass graft on the right side and the concern was for graft occlusion.
The patient also became quite agitated and was given several doses of Haldol which controlled her agitation.
On [**2170-4-1**], the medical ICU team was consulted for an episode of respiratory distress.
Chest x-ray revealed multifocal infiltrates consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
The patient's blood pressure was in the 70s and 80s consistent with septic shock.
PA catheter was placed which confirmed septic shock likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
The patient's ICU course was really complicated by refractory hypotension and lactic acidosis.
CVVH was initiated to improve acid-base as well as for volume removal.
Code status was discussed with family the following morning, who stated that the patient would not want resuscitation in the event of a terminal cardiac event.
Despite this on the [**4-4**] at 04:30 a.m., the patient underwent a prolonged episode of polymorphic VT which degenerated into ventricular fibrillation and eventually asystole.
No CPR, no compressions were initiated secondary to family's previous request.
