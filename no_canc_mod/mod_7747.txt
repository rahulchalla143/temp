Admission Date: [**2107-1-16**]        Discharge Date: [**2107-2-10**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  F  Service:   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Congestive heart failure, non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old female with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who developed a cough five days prior to admission.
She was started on antibiotics one day prior to admission secondary to being short of breath.
The patient was at an outside hospital on [**1-16**], was intubated, became hypotensive and started on Dopamine, briefly found to be pulseless in the field.
At that time, echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20 percent with anterior hypokinesis.
An emergent catheterization showed patent grafts, however, severe congestive heart failure with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34.
On admission to [**Hospital1 69**] the patient was found to be in cardiogenic shock with a low cardiac output and high SVR.
Cardiac output improved on dopamine although the patient developed ATN and shock liver with AST in the 10,000 range.
The patient then developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate versus atrial tachycardia without any response to adenosine.
The patient was cardioverted on amiodarone but the amiodarone drip was discontinued secondary to liver failure.
The numbers on [**1-18**] were more consistent with sepsis with a cardiac output of 5.0 and an SVR of 704.
On [**1-19**], the patient developed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 170s with shocks times two and loaded on digoxin.
Significant for coronary artery disease status post    coronary artery bypass graft in [**2102**].
Questionable diet controlled diabetes mellitus.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Left main coronary artery with mild disease.
Left anterior descending with diffuse disease.
Left circumflex with mild disease; right coronary artery with proximal total occlusion; saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and left anterior descending were patent.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  No significant lesions in graft    on catheterization.
PUMP:  Repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction    of 20 percent with global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Initial concern was for cardiogenic shock; however, the    patient continued to spike fevers and physiology was more    concerning for sepsis.
The patient remained    tachycardic during most of the hospital course.
Once the    pressors were weaned, able to initiate an ACE inhibitor    and low dose beta blocker and titrate as tolerated by    blood pressure.
RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation versus supraventricular    tachycardia versus atrial arrhythmia.
HYPOTENSION:  Initially presumed to be cardiogenic, but    hemodynamics later were more consistent with sepsis and    blood pressure and cardiac output improved with fluid    boluses.
The patient was weaned off Levophed but    exquisitely sensitive to small changes in dose    questionably thought to be secondary to autonomic    dysfunction.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Persistent fevers, septic physiology.
A chest x-ray was without infiltrate.
Concern    for sepsis given increased cardiac output and dropping    SVR.
After a two week course of broad spectrum    antibiotics, the patient started to produce sputum    positive for E. Coli.
The    pathogen was thought to be from a new ventilator acquired    pneumonia versus prior infectious etiology for sepsis.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Evidence of shock liver with    transaminases in the 10,000 range and concerning for bowel    ischemia given guaiac positive stools.
Given the concern    for guaiac positive stools, the patient had an EGD and    colonoscopy.
EGD showed a 1 to 2 centimeter mass in the    esophagus and mild gastritis in the stomach body.
Colonoscopy showed non-bleeding rectal ulcer thought to be    the cause of the guaiac positive stools.
PULMONARY:  Evidence of congestive heart failure by chest    x-ray and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
She received a two week course of antibiotics with    ceftazidine for E. coli pneumonia.
RENAL:  Acute renal failure / ATN from shock.
There was    no evidence of DIC.
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient remained sedated for much of the    hospital course and minimally responsive.
Sedative    medications (Versed and Fentanyl) were discontinued for 96    hours without significance starting on [**1-26**].
The thought was that the patient had taken large    hit to liver and renal function secondary to sepsis /    shock.
The    patient was started on Dilantin with thoughts that there    may have been seizure activity; however, this did not seem    to make acute improvements in mental status.
The patient    demonstrated marked weakness secondary to immobilization,    however, neurologically intact.
Congestive heart failure with systolic and diastolic    dysfunction.
Cardiogenic shock.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation requiring shock and chemical    cardioversion.
Septic shock.
Escherichia coli pneumonia.
Acute renal failure.
Ischemic hepatitis.
Followup with GI in two to three weeks for biopsy results.
