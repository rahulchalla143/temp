There may be some intraventricular extension of hemorrhage, as well as a small subdural component tracking along the falx.
There is marked associated mass effect throughout the right hemisphere as well as dilatation of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There are approximately 3-4 mm of leftward shift of midline structures.
There is extensive low attenuation surrounding the hemorrhage.
There is mild irregularity and calcification within the carotid segments bilaterally, otherwise, the petrous segments are normal.
There is a small posterior communicating artery infundibulum on the right side.
Within the cavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery, just beyond the anterior genu, there is a linear 3 mm posteriorly oriented outpouching compatible with a small aneurysm.
There is a small left-sided posterior communicating artery infundibulum.
There is pansinus disease with a hypoplastic right frontal sinus.
The ophthalmic arteries are patent and no intraorbital abnormalities identified.
There may be some blood layering within the posterior thecal sac at the upper cervical spine (3:7).
Large right occipital lobe intraparenchymal hematoma with marked associated mass effect and dilatation of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Narrow 3-mm aneurysm of the cavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery.
Head CT [**8-21**]: HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no significant change in right-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the right occipital parietotemporal lobe.
There is edema with extensive effacement of the sulci throughout the entire right hemisphere.
There is mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle, and approximately 3 mm of left shift of midline, which is not changed since the prior evening.
There is no definite change since the prior evening.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and soft tissues appear unchanged, with sinus mucosal disease, most severe in the left maxillary sinus.
No significant change since the prior evening, with no evident increase in the size of hemorrhage.
Continued severe mass effect upon the right hemisphere, with extensive effacement of sulci and compression of the right lateral ventricle and dilation of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
ECHO [**8-22**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2160-8-22**] FINDINGS: There is a large right parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring 6.7 x 3.5 cm with persistent perihemorrhagic edema and mass effect on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
There is persistent near-complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus and anterior ethmoid mucosal thickening.
There are no short-term interval changes.
No other short-term interval changes.
SHOULDER RIGHT [**2160-8-25**] FINDINGS: There is no glenohumeral joint dislocation.
There is a curvilinear density adjacent to the superior posterior lateral aspect of the right humeral head which may represent a small fracture fragment from [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 3450**] deformity.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 45M who presented to an OSH on [**8-19**] after complaining of left sided visual difficulty(in both eyes).
He was admitted to an OSH with diagnosis of embolic stroke of the PCA.
In the overnight hours of [**8-20**], he hand an abrupt MS change and a CT scan was performed, which showed hemorrhagic conversion.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive care.
He had an elevated WBC count of 14.7 but this normalized and no active infection was detected.
The patient continued to have cognitive deficits and required redirection at times.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Cyclobenzaprine 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for muscle spasm.
