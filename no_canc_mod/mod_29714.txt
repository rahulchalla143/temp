Pt has long hx of labile BP and hyponatremia.
Pt did not tolerate Lasix as she did not like having a dry mouth while on it and was switched to chlorthalidone.
Admits to some b/l pedal edema that has been improving since decreasing dose of felodipine.

MICRO: [**2126-7-15**] Blood cultures: no growth to date [**2126-7-16**] Urine culture: no growth .
IMAGING: [**2126-7-15**] CXR: There is pulmonary edema with basilar opacity likely atelectasis.
No pneumothorax.
Left effusion, possibly small right effusion noted.
[**2126-7-16**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
There is now borderline tissue Doppler/mitral inflow evidence of high left ventricular diastolic filling pressures.
Mild residual pulmonary edema can explain the lung opacities and pleural effusion.
Superimposed infection cannot be excluded but is less likely.
Left renal lesions, probably cysts, but a son[**Name (NI) **] is suggested.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 year old woman with a history of HTN and pulmonary HTN who presents with SOB and hypoxia.
# Hypoxia, SOB: CHF versus pneumonia were on differentials.
Pneumonia was considered with pt's history of progressively worsening cough and shortness of breath with leukocytosis and subjective fevers.
CXR shows pleural effusions but no lobar consolidations, and given that pt recently stopped diuretics, it was likely pt was fluid overloaded.
TTE showed moderate mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hyptertension (stable from prior).
Pt came in with SBP in 190s and we continued felodipine and started TID captopril.
On hospital day 2 pt became oliguric and Cr bump to 1.3 and thus stopped captopril.
# Anxiety: Pt was having multiple anxiety episodes upon admission and we continued her home diazepam.
During these episodes, pt's BP increased significantly with tachycardia and had periods of nausea.
# Hyponatremia: Pt's sodium remained low throughout MICU course and has a history of having diuretics changed due to hyponatremia.
Urine lytes, osm and urea were checked which showed low Na and osm consistent with dehyradation.
# Anemia: Pt has h/o of anemia which had been worked up recently with EGD and colonoscopy.
# Hypothyroidism: Chronic and stable.
# Renal lesions: Two renal lesions were seen incidentally on CT.
Recommend that PCP get renal ultrasound to further characterize and to eval for renal cell carcinoma (considering her iron deficiency anemia of unclear etiology).
# Transitional Issues: - Needs renal ultrasound - Anemia workup  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Atenolol 50 mg PO DAILY 3. butalbital-acetaminophen-caff *NF* 50-325-40 mg Oral q4-6 PRN headache 4.
Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY 13. butalbital-acetaminophen-caff *NF* 50 mg ORAL Q4-6 PRN headache 14.
Furosemide 10 mg PO DAILY To be taken until you see your primary care doctor Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] RX *furosemide 20 mg 0.5 (One half) tablet(s) by mouth daily Disp #*10 Tablet Refills:*0  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: community acquired pneumonia, pulmonary edema Secondary: hypertension, pulmonary hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because you have been having shortness of breath and fevers.
The chest x-ray and cat scan show that you have pneumonia as well as fluid in your lungs which is likely related to the pneumonia.
You also have pulmonary hypertension which has been a longstanding issue, but which may be contributing.
You are anemic which is not new, but which is slightly worse than prior, and you were found to have low iron.
The cat scan showed two lesions in your kidneys which may be benign cysts, however your primary care doctor will need to do further workup for this.
START benzonatate (Tessalon perles) as needed for cough .
