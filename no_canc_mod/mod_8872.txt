Picc line placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 32457**] is a 37 yo F with h/o Ulcerative Colitis, Primary sclerosing cholangitis with ESLD s/p 2 liver transplants in [**2161-3-26**], with the second transplant complicated by neurocognificant defects attributed to cerebral edema, and biopsy in [**2165**] performed for increasing alk phos showing PSC recurrence.
She was transferred from Eastern [**Hospital 1727**] Hospital at the request of transplant surgery for persistent fevers of unknown origin.
This is Ms. [**Known lastname 32461**] third hospital admission for fevers in the last 2 months.
Her first admission was at [**Hospital6 8432**] Center [**Date range (1) 32462**] when she presented with vomiting and diarrhea thought to be from viral gastroenteritis.
After discharge she developed upper respiratory symptoms.
She was given 10 days of tamiflu for recent outbreak at her rehab.
She reportedly did not have any mental status changes, new rash or changes in PO intake.
At that time, she did not have new rashes, HA, change in mental status, and was only battling respiratory symptoms.
She continued in her usual state until 2 days prior to her current presentation when she was noted to be more lethargic and had fevers again to 102.
She has baseline loose stools, but unclear whether they have been increasing in quantity, frequency, or caliber.
CT scan showed bowel wall thickening involving mainly the sigmoid and rectum, and to a lesser degree the cecum and ascending colon in addition to small locules of air in liver which may represent pneumobilia.
Past Medical History: * ESLD secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis, s/p living unrelated donor transplant in [**3-/2161**] which failed (thrombosed) leading to second transplant complicated by tracheostomy, feeding tube, and cerebral edema requiring VP shunt * IBD - UC diagnosed [**2156**] after p/w bloody stools * cognitive defecits from anoxic brain injury [**1-27**] respiratory arrest * h/o cerebral edema s/p VP shunt * h/o prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy * h/o dysphagia and aspiration PNA with G tube placement (now removed) * h/o seizures, on anticonvulsants * Ulcerative colitis * h/o dysphagia * h/o aspiration PNA * H/o UTIs * Psoriasis * h/o DVT in post-op period * Hypothyroidism, on Synthroid  Social History: Living at [**Hospital 32458**] rehab facility following anoxic brain injury in [**2161**].
No history of tobacco or alcohol use.
Family History: One brother with [**Name (NI) 4522**] disease or ulcerative colitis s/p bowel resection.
Mother with breast cancer (d. [**2164**])  Physical Exam: ADMISSION PEx: VS:  101.1, 112/74, 115, 24@94%(RA) GENERAL: Female in NAD laying in fetal position in bed, agitated when examined, speaking in one-word statements such as "juice," "drink" HEENT: NC/AT, NGT in place, PERRL, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear.
SKIN: Non-jaundiced, no rashes or lesions.
LYMPH: No cervical LAD appreciated.
CNs II-XII grossly intact, moving all extremities, non-cooperativ with sensation coordinaiton, and relaxing for DTR testing.
However, no hemorrhage.
There is FLAIR hyperintensity, slow diffusion and enhancement in the subarachnoid space overlying the right posterior frontal and parietal lobes.
This is concerning for subarachnoid empyema with menengitis and encephalitis.
There is a thin subdural collection overlying the right hemisphere which demonstrates FLAIR hyperintensity and enhancement without slow diffusion which may represent a subdural hemorrhage, or dural thickening/fluid related to the previous shunt manipulation.
Infection cannot be excluded in this compartment.
Brief Hospital Course: 36 h/o UC, PSC with ESLD s/p 2 liver transplants [**2161-3-29**] c/b graft failure and cerebral edema with permanent anoxic brain injury s/p VP shunt who is chronically immunosupressed after transplants p/w fevers (to 102) and found to have question of colitis on CT. .
Differenials included IBD flare, especially with pancolotis on colonoscopy.
CT abd/pel showed signs of colitis on admission, but no abscess.
She completed a course of Influenza prophylaxis prior to admission, and had no respiratory symptoms.
Drug fever was considered, but there were no recent medication changes making this less likely.
CNS infection was considered, but no change in MS per husband, no rashes, and no CT head findings to increase suspicion.
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder was also considered, but patient was then found to have potential sources with UTI and VP shunt that traversed the bowel wall.
Colonoscopy on HD3 revealed pancolitis, as well as unclear foreign object that seemed to be embedded in the bowel wall.
CSF studies were sent at that time, and revealed E. Coli.
UTI: patient was diagnosed with a UTI based on urine culture.
She was initially given a dose of ciprofloxacin, however, given past sensitivities and concern for concomitant infection once it was learned that she had VP shunt connection with bowel flora, she was switched to broad coverage with CefePIME, Vancomycin, MetRONIDAZOLE (FLagyl).
Ulcerative colitis with pan-colitis on colonoscopy: this in itself could have been contributing to her cyclical fevers.
Trigger for flare may have been bowel wall irritation with CSF from VP shunt.
Hx of seizures and anoxic brain injury: no SZ activity during first part of hospitalization (she had been continued on her home dose of Keppra), however, she was transferred to the ICU on the day prior to her OR date for removal of her VP shunt for status epilepticus.
She had a second seizure that persisted for 15 minutes, despite Ativan, until she received sedatives for intubation.
She had decreased discharges with the addition of vimpat and was eventually increased to vimpat 200mg [**Hospital1 **].
h/o dysphagia with regular diet at rehab: when patient was not NPO, she was given a regular diet with aspiration precautions.
12. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
19. heparin, porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Eastern Main Medical Acute Rehab Unit  Discharge Diagnosis: Meningitis Perforated Colon Pancolitis Seizures UTI   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Requires FALL PRECAUTIONS   Discharge Instructions: Please call the Transplant Office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] if fever, chills, seizure activity, change in mental status, head/abdominal incision sites appear red or have drainage.
