There was apparently seizure activity and EMS arrived to find the patient "post-ictal," incontinent of urine and stool, with some bruising over the right eye.
CT of the head showed a left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with a component of SAH.
Extraocular movements intact laterally, no nystagmus.
Moving upper and lower extremities anti-gravity and symmetrically without obvious focal deficit.
Coordination and gait: unable  ON DISCHARGE PT WITHOUT NONFOCAL NEUROLOGICAL EXAM.

There are no focal consolidations.
There are no displaced rib fractures.
No evidence of displaced rib fracture.
Non-contrast CT head: Reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**], a left frontal IPH, ~2.4 x 1.7 cm with subarachnoid component noted along convexity.
There is a gap at the mid-frontal bone that was concerning for a fracture at the OSH.
However, it appears somewhat distinct from the area of hemorrhage and there is no clinical correlate with trauma at that location on examination.
We also reviewed CT C-spine that showed no apparent fracture or other pathology.
No significant change in the acute intraparenchymal hematoma, with subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage, as described above.
Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital horns, better seen on MR.  2.
No definite abnormal enhancement noted in the left frontal lobe at the site of the hematoma to suggest a vascular lesion.
However, any underlying vascular lesions obscured by the hematoma cannot be evaluated.
To consider repeating the study without and with IV contrast as well as MR angiogram, after resolution of the hematoma, for assessment for any vascular lesions.
Moderate sinusitis, as described above, with a few retention cysts/polyps in the maxillary sinuses.
No evidence of acute fracture.
MRI showed no definitive underlying lesion.
The patient had left shoulder discomfort limiting range of motion and an x-ray revealed osteoarthritis and an old healed fracture.
No acute PT / OT needs.
