On exam she was found to have cool, pulsless right foot and a CTA revealed a right CFA occlusion.
Of note the pt has a h/o PAD with a left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass and subsequent angioplasty to the graft about a year ago.
She was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] in [**2106-12-21**] and had bilateral lower extremity angiography for persistent bilateral LE claudication symtptoms.
Records also state that the angio showed hemodynamically moderate Right common iliac artery stenosis and moderate distal right superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery.

[**2107-2-22**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
A small secundum atrial septal defect is present.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 43357**] was transferred from an OSH on [**2107-2-21**] with acute ischemia of her right lower extremity and a CT angiogram which showed thrombus involving the distal external iliac, common femoral and proximal superficial femoral and deep femoral arteries.
Upon transfer the patient was in florid pulmonary edema (as a result of contrast dye allergy), had EKG changes suggestive of an evolving MI and was intubated.
The pt had atrial fibrillation on [**2-24**] which initially resolved with iv lopressor.
She did have several other episodes of afib and was eventually rate controlled with beta blocker.
She was found to have stenosis of the SVG-LAD graft and underwent successful PCI of the SVG-LAD with DES.
Although initially anticoagulated for her iliofemoral thrombus, it is also indicated given her atrial fibrillation.
She was restarted on coumadin with a goal INR of 2.0-3.0  On [**2-25**] the bedside nurse noted the pt had difficulty swallowing and a speech/swallow consult was obtained.
However, on [**2-26**] the pt did take some po's with nursing supervision and tolerated without difficulty.
A speech re-evaluation later confirmed that the pt was taking po's without difficulty.
