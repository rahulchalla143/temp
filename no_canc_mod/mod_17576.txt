PICC line placement x 2  History of Present Illness: 45F with ESLD secondary to EtOH, AIHA due to lasix recently on prednisone who was initially presented to OSH with hepatic encephalopathy transferred from OSH on [**5-27**] for liver transplant evaluation whose course has been complicated by coagulopathy with recurrent epistaxis, VRE bacteremia, new onset Afib with RVR and now with worsening leukocytosis and diffuse bilat pulmonary infiltrates.
To summarize her recent course, the patient was admitted to OSH from [**Date range (1) 74368**] for hemolytic anemia thought to be [**1-15**] lasix and was started on prednisone 50mg.
CXR showed b/l infiltrates and she received tx with vanco, levoflox, and zosyn and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for liver transplant eval.
At [**Hospital1 18**], she was noted to have numerous small pulmonary nodules on [**5-29**] chest CT of unclear significance.
Pulm consulted for ?bronch given concern for infection vs. malignancy.
Eventually blood cultures from [**6-11**] returned [**12-17**] bottles +ve for VRE and was started on daptomycin.
Also on [**6-11**], the patient was started on CTX for positive U/A which was then continued per ID to empirically cover possible SBP.
Also treated for hepatorenal syndrome (cre 1.5 which improved to 0.4) with albumin, midodrine, and octreotide x 4 days, which was d/c'd on [**6-16**] given improvement in renal function.
On [**6-14**], the patient developed significant epistaxis requiring multiple FFP, platelet, and RBC transfusions.
There was concern for aspiration given altered mental status.
On [**6-16**], the medical team repeated her CT chest to eval for progression of pulmonary nodules and found bilateral infiltrates concerning for infection, bleeding, or aspiration.
Also on [**6-16**] developed new-onset Afib with RVR 150s that responded to diltiazem.
Due to increased volume of diarrhea and climbing WBC count she was started on empiric flagyl on [**2106-6-17**].
On transfer to the MICU, the patient denies any complaints including shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, confusion.

RADIOLOGY: ========= [**5-28**] ABD U/S- DOPPLER LIVER ULTRASOUND: No prior studies are available for comparison.
The TIPS is patent with wall-to-wall color flow.
There is a small amount of ascites surrounding the liver, relatively less in the lower quadrants.
The liver is extremely shrunken and nodular with very heterogeneous echotexture.
Anterior to the TIPS stent are multiple tubular hypo-to-anechoic structures which could represent dilated ducts or less likely, thrombosed veins.
No frank mass lesion is identified but assessment is limited due to the shrunken appearance of the liver.
Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flows and appropriate velocities as listed above.
Shrunken cirrhotic liver without overt hepatic mass.
If no prior examinations are available for comparison, and the patient is a high risk patient i.e.
Chronic occlusion of the left portal vein and posterior division of the right portal vein with corkscrew hepatic arteries which are patent.
There is a tiny left hepatic artery off of the proper hepatic artery with an accessory branch off the left gastric artery.
No suspicious hepatic lesions.
Moderate intraabdominal and intrapelvic ascites with extensive intraabdominal varices as described consistent with portal hypertension.
ECHO (TTE) [**2106-6-1**]- Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Trivial aortic regurgitation.
There is no pneumothorax.
New ill-defined opacity in the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac area is consistent with atelectasis and/or area of aspiration Small left pleural effusion is also new.
The coalescing airspace disease adjacent to the minor fissure appears much improved.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate-to-large ascites as well as subcutaneous edema are unchanged from the prior exam.
A spot was marked for paracentesis to be performed by the clinical service.
No focal lesions identified.
Portable CXR [**6-14**]: IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2106-6-12**]: Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened and new opacification at the lung bases is probably a combination of atelectasis and mild edema.
Pleural effusion is small, on the left, unchanged acutely.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**6-16**] Chest CT FINDINGS: Since the prior study there has been marked worsening of the alveolar opacities involving both lungs, predominantly in the upper zones.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are borderline lymph nodes in the paratracheal region measuring up to 9 mm in short axis.
The central airways are patent without endoluminal lesions.
Marked worsening of bilateral extensive alveolar opacities particularly centrally.
The rapidity of development and distribution is most concerning for pulmonary edema, however, atypical infection or less likely pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Cirrhotic liver with a moderate amount of ascites and TIPS shunt in place.
Brief Hospital Course: 45 yo female with ESLD [**1-15**] EtOH cirrhosis s/p TIPS who presented from OSH for liver transplant evaluation, recent severe bleeding, who developed sepsis, DIC, and multiorgan failure.
Lactate continued to rise and she became progressively acidotic.
She was treated broadly with antibiotics and aggressively transfused with blood products and albumin for intravascular volume support and to correct her underlying coagulopathy.
The patient was made CMO after an extensive family discussion regarding her poor prognosis and she rapidly expired after removal of vasopressors and respiratory support.
# Respiratory Failure: Progressively worsening bilateral lung infiltrates resulting in hypoxia requiring intubation.
She was afebrile with rapidly progressive leukocytosis.
The patient was treated with steroids and bactrim for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 74369**] for fungal coverage, and levaquin to cover mycoplasma, and flagyl for anaerobic coverage.
Given worsening infiltrates and P/F ratio suggestive of ARDS, she was ventilated on ARDSnet protocol to minimize barotrauma and allowed permissive hypercapnea.
# Acute renal failure: Cr progressively worsened in the setting of sepsis and the patient became anuric.
She was unable to take po octreotide, midodrine due to increased GI secretions and poor absorption.
The patient developed a severe lactic acid metabolic acidosis due to tissue hypoxia requiring HCO3 pushes.
# ETOH Cirrhosis: Decompensated liver disease s/p TIPS, with hepatic encephalopathy, coagluapathy, elevated Tbili, hyponatremia.
On admission, aldactone held given hyponatremia and hypotension.
She was given lactulose and rifaxamin for hepatic encephalopathy.
Ultrasound perfomed on admission and showed patent TIPS, cirrhotic liver, no hepatoma.
TTE showed a hyperdynamic EF, with no pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular disease.
PFT's performed, with noted mild diffusion abnormality.
Chest CT demonstrated pulmonary nodules (see below) which were stable on repeat CT chest one week later.
Hospitalization was complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, hyponatremia and hepatorenal syndrome.
HRS improved after midodrine and octreotide, and albumin steadied hyponatremia near baseline of 127-129.
On [**2106-6-16**], pt developed atrial fibrillation to 160's.
On transfer to the MICU, she had bursts of atrial flutter with variable block and rate-dependent bundle branch block.
She remained asymptomatic but nodal agents were held given hypotension.
# Leukocytosis: Initially with nosocomial pneumonia at outside hospital treated with a course of IV antibiotics.
Although pulmonary nodules were seen on chest CT, this was not felt to represent an acute infectious process given lack of associated signs or symptoms of infection, therefore no further antibiotics were given.
Acute alcoholic hepatitis was considered as a possible cause of leukocytosis, however there was no recent alcohol use to go along with this diagnosis.
Felt that PICC line was possible source; however, wound tip culture showed no growth.
Echocardiogram was negative for vegetation.
On [**6-16**], a repeat chest CT was performed for further characterization of pulmonary nodules which revealed the interval development of diffuse hazy opacities thought to be consistent with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 7470**] given that she was weaned off steroids for AIHA only days earlier.
# Coagulopathy: [**1-15**] liver disease.
Also received ddAVP for uremic platelets.
She had an episode of profuse epistaxis in the setting of trauma from Doboff feeding tube that could only be controlled with packing, Afrin and pressure by ENT.
She developed DIC and diffuse mucosal bleeding after becoming septic.
# Auto-Immune Hemolytic Anemia: Diagnosed with auto-immune hemolytic anemia at outside hospital, felt to be secondary to lasix.
Lasix was held during admission and repeat coombs antibody negative.
Reticulocyte count high on admission (29%), with elevated LDH, tbili, and decreasing hematocrit suggestive of ongoing hemolysis.
