Admission Date:  [**2157-11-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-11-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 97194**] is an 89 year-old man with a history of CHF (EF 30%, NYHA class III), CAD s/p CABG and recent PCI, and atrial fibrillation, admitted with hypotension.
Most recently, he was admitted [**10-15**] - [**10-20**] after a fall when he was found to have a bloody R effusion (Hct 2%).
He was then re-admitted [**10-22**] - [**11-2**] for CHF and NSTEMI with PCI.
At that time part of his hypoxia was thought to be due to his reaccumulated effusion, and it was again tapped, removing 1.5 L of blood-tinged sputum.
He has remained quite frail with a poor functional status, using a walker but unable to get far due to shortness of breath.
The procedure was stopped due to low pressures, but the patient was asymptomatic.
CXR showed a well-expanded lung and a small pneumothorax that was thought to be clinically insignificant.
However, he seemed very weak and not himself so he brought her to the ED.
CXR was concerning for pneumonia.
IP wanted to keep him dry, but he was given 1 L NS for low urine output.

Premature ventricular contractions and premature atrial contractions are probably present.
Possible prior septal myocardial infarction, age undetermined.
Tiny right apical pneumothorax.
New right lower lung opacity concerning for asymmetric/reexpansion pulmonary edema vs pneumonia.
Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 97194**] is an 89y/o man with an extensive cardiac history including chronic systolic CHF (last EF 30%), CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**], last PCI in [**10/2157**] with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**] to LIMA, Afib not on coumadin and recurrent pleural effusions s/p recent large volume thoracentesis, who presented with hypotension and weakness in the setting of increased diuretic regimen.
# Hypotension: Was likely related to large volume thoracentesis on [**11-11**], hypovolemia from being NPO and poor PO intake since last discharge, strict 6 cup fluid restriction, and recent change and titration up of diuretics and antihypertensive regimen.
I addition, Tamsulosin was stopped (he had no trouble urinating).
# Chronic systolic CHF: last EF 30% on [**9-/2157**] TTE, NYHA class III.
No evidence of overload now.
# Atrial fibrillation: he was rate controlled (60-80).
# Coronary artery disease: Troponin was stable at .03 x3, most likely demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension, less likely [**2-8**] atrial stretch given no evidence of overload.
# Hyperlipidemia: stable.
# BPH s/p TURP: holding Tamsulosin due to low BP/lightheadedness, but hehad no trouble urinating.
Goals of Care: Unfortunately, the patient has been readmitted frequently to the hospital; this time it was because of asymptomatic low SBP readings.
In discussions with Mr. and Mrs. [**Known lastname 97194**], it was clear that they understand the prognosis of advanced heart failure, especially in the setting of needing to cut back on medications such as Spironolactone that would benefit him in the long run.
6. nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet Sublingual once as needed for chest pain: may repeat every 5 minutes for 3doses; please seek help if having chest pain.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: -hypotension -chronic systolic congestive heart failure -fatigue   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because of low blood pressures.
You will follow up with your PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] (for blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and heart failure management), and also Pulmonology (to follow up your pulmonary effusion).
