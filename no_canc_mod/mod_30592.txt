In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname 96706**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with h/o a-fib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG X 2, and recent hospitalizations at [**Hospital1 112**] for C. diff colitis who initially presented with hypotension and supratherapeutic INR.
Per wife, pt had ongoing diarrhea prior to presentation.
Had brief episode of SVT to 180s, resolved with carotid massage.
Cardiac enzymes showed flat CKs, but elevated CK-MB (18), MBI (23.1), and troponin peak to 0.95 in setting of acute on chronic renal failure which was thought to be pre-renal in etiology.
Intubated on [**3-20**] for worsening mental status and airway protection.
retrocardiac opacity, fluffy infiltrates, and pleural effusions.
The patient received 10 mg IV lasix in the AM on [**3-25**] to promote diuresis, given that the patient was felt to be intravascularly depleted with third spacing after fluid resuscitation.
1 L NS hung wide open, with pressures transiently bumping to 90s systolic, but BP noted as low as 60s systolic.
On exam, patient was noted to have upper respiratory noises, but SaO2 persistently high 90s on 3L.
Past Medical History: (all records at [**Hospital1 112**], PMH here per wife) atrial fibrillation on coumadin CAD s/p CABG X 2 ([**2111**], [**2118**]) CHF: EF 45% in [**2135-4-10**] hypertension recent renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 1.6) anemia (on iron)   Social History: Lives with wife.
Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: ON TRANSFER TO MICU: T: 96.3 Ax BP: 79/51 HR: 93 RR: 24 O2 91% RA 4 L NC Gen: elderly gentleman in mild distress, grunting occasionally while lying in bed HEENT: No conjunctival pallor.
NECK: supple, no LAD, no JVD appreciated, has Right IJ CVL in place CV: normal rate & irregular, no murmurs appreciated LUNGS: clear anteriorly, decreased breath sounds at bases ABD: somewhat distended, + bowel sounds, nontender to palpation EXT: feet & hands slightly cool but + DP & radial pulses, no peripheral edema SKIN: scattered ecchymoses NEURO: moaning, not following commands, but turns head to voice   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with h/o recent C diff, CAD s/p CABG, atrial fibrillation who who presented initially with supratherapeutic INR and hypotension in setting of C. diff, and who now is re-admitted to the ICU with hypotension.
# Hypotension: Etiology most likely due to sepsis.
Differential sources at the time included C diff or pulmonary.
Blood cultures no growth.
Patient wa maintained on pressors and it was not possible to wean of due to hypotension.
C Diff was treated with Flagyl and po vancomycin for 14 days after [**3-24**], and also covered for hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin.
Patient had PEA arrest on [**2136-3-28**].
Patient was continued to receive full care but no resuscitation if heart stops.
ECHO [**3-29**] no right heart strain, largely unchanged from prior.
CE trending downward, likely elevated in setting of CPR and renal failure.
Had CT head on [**3-20**] which was negative for acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Patient may had difficulty clearing sedatives, although has been off for several days.
Likely due to sepsis or pre-septic.
# Respiratory failure: Pt initially intubated for respiratory failure, but extubated on [**3-22**].
Patient with loud respiratory noises, secretions, coarse breath sounds on exam.
Empirical treatment for hospital acquired pneumonia with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
# Renal insufficiency: Baseline Cr 1.6-2.0.
# Volume status: pt overloaded during LOS and pitting edema on physical exam.
# Supra therapeutic INR: On admission, likely related to recent poor nutrition and diarrhea plus medication changes with Coumadin.
# CAD s/p CABG X 2: Not on aspirin at home per current medication record.
Re-cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of hypotension as above.
Representing cute decompensation in the setting of sepsis and possible fluid overload.
Cardiac ischemia ruled out, and no new valvular disease  During the course of MICU stay it was not possible to wean patient off pressors and ventilator.
Patient deceased on the same day due to cardiopulmonay arrest.
