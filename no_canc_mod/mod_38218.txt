History of Present Illness:  This is an 88 year old creole speaking male nursing home resident with a PMH significant for HTN, and DM who presented with symptoms of dyspnea and abdominal pain radiating to the neck.
The patient reported severe "gas pain" radiating to the neck on the night of [**2-2**] at his nursing facility and presented with sudden onset dyspnea this morning prompting transfer to [**Hospital3 **].
At [**Hospital1 **], initial saturations were in the low 80s and a CXR demonstrated cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, and infiltrates.
Labs were significant for elevated BNP (555) and troponin I (2.2).
EKG demonstrated ST elevation in III, AVF with reciprocal depression lateral leads.
EKG demonstrated ST elevation noted III, AVF with reciprocal depression lateral leads initially felt to be < 1mm.
Catheterization demonstrated right dominant system with diffuse disease in the mid - distal RCA with 90% stenosis followed by ectactic segments and a subtotal versus recanalized total occlusion and faint distal filling.
Left heart cath was significant for proximal occlusion of the ramus with no effective antegrade perfusion.
The left circumfelx was notable for diffuse plaquing throughout 30-70%.
He was chest pain free on arrival to the floor.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -DM2 : poorly controlled -HTN -OSA -Left sided tibial fracture -GERD -transaminitis: unknown etiology?
He states that he broke his legs years ago and has been wheelchair bound since then.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No abominojugular reflex.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Trace pedal edema bilaterally.
No femoral bruits at catherter site.
Small hematoma on palpation.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Hypopigmented skin lesions noted throughout upper and lower extremitites including chest likely vitiligo.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No abominojugular reflex.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: Bibasilar crackles noted w/ rhonchi in mid right lung.
No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Trace pedal edema bilaterally.
No femoral bruits at catherter site.
Small hematoma on palpation.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Hypopigmented skin lesions noted throughout upper and lower extremitites including chest likely vitiligo.
Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension 3.
Elevated PCW consistent with at least moderate Left ventricular diastolic heart failure.
Severe right ventricular diastolic heart failure.
Moderate pulmonary edema.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusion.
Mild cardiomegaly.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %) with extensive akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dilated left ventricle with inferior/inferolateral akinesis and hypokinesis of all remaining segments.
| AMPICILLIN------------   <=2 S NITROFURANTOIN--------  <=16 S TETRACYCLINE----------  =>16 R VANCOMYCIN------------     1 S   Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: This is and 88 year old gentleman w/ h/o DM2 and HTN who presented from OSH w/ inferior STEMI and is s/p DESx3 to RCA and [**Year/Month/Day **] to Ramus admitted to CCU for monitoring.
Catheterization demonstrated right dominant system with 3VD (LCx, Ramus and RCA).
Given ST elevations in inferior leads, culprit lesions  most likely in RCA although collaterals noted on cath.
Coronary artery risk factors include diabetes and hypertension.
He was chest pain free on hospital day 2, and continued to be chest pain free on discharge.
# CHF:  The patient was noted to be volume overloaded on CXR with elevated BNP.
Overload may represent chronic failure (patient is on home lasix) versus acute onset in setting of ongoing STEMI.
Cath demonstrated elevated PCWP consistent with mild-moderate LV diastolic heart failure.
No symptoms of orthopnea, peripheral edema or PND on patient hx.
Physical exam not remakable for florid failure.
CXR also c/w fluid overload.
Diuresis initially held, and started on hospital day 2 with 20mg IV lasix.
TTE today showed EF 20-25%, and severe global LV hypokinesis.
# RHYTHM:  Sinus rhythm on admission however presents with diltiazem on admission.
Unclear if prior history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not currently on anticoagulation.
# URINALYSIS: Urinalysis normal.
Urine culture positive for enteroccocus likely foley catheter.
# GUAIC POSITIVE BROWN STOOL: Had one episode of guaic positive stool.
Would recommend outpatient follow-up and review of age-appropriate cancer screening.
6. lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Solution Sig: Fifteen (15) cc PO three times a day as needed for constipation.
10. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for constipation.
Guaifenesin DM 10-200 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Five (5) ml PO four times a day as needed for cough.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 10246**] Extended Care Center - [**Location (un) 2268**]  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Hypertension Urinary Tract Infection Diabetes Mellitus Acute Systolic congestive Heart failure   Discharge Condition: Stable Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You had trouble breathing and a heart attack.
There were many blockages in your heart arteries and we fixed the blockages that were causing the heart attack.
Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
You also have a urinary tract infection, you will need 10 days of ampicillin to treat this and another urine culture should be sent after the antibiotics are done.
