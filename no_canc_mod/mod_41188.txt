**FINAL REPORT [**2197-12-7**]**     Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2197-12-7**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
There is partially visualized anterior and posterior fusion of the mid and lower cervical spine.
There is posterior fusion extending from T9-S1 with corresponding pedicle screws at all levels and two vertical posterior metallic rods.
There is disc narrowing and associated osteophytes at most of the fused levels as well as at T7-T8 and T8-9.
Slight angular kyphosis centered at T8-9.
The visualized medial lung is clear with slightly tortuous aorta.
There is a moderate amount of stool in the right and transverse colon.
PATHOLOGY LUMBAR WOUND [**11-26**]: Acute osteomyelitis.
Extensive post-operative changes in the posterior soft tissues with foci of signal hypointensity which may reflect air.
However, no definite focal collection in the soft tissues or epidural space is identified on this limited exam.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
No acute intra-abdominal process.
No evidence of obstruction.
Nonobstructing 2 mm right renal calculus.
Partial nonocclusive thrombus involving the right brachial vein containing the PICC.
No evidence of DVT within the remaining veins.
There is a moderate left and small right pleural effusion.
Left lower lobe atelectasis is noted, unchanged.
There are mild interstitial opacities consistent with edema.
KUB (there are a series of these that are unchanged: latest on [**12-8**]) Multiple air-filled dilated loops of large and small bowel compatible with ileus.
The appearance has not changed significantly from yesterday's examination.
Small nonobstructing left renal stone.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
No renal vein thrombosis visualized on limited Doppler evaluation.
Large fluid collection with surrounding calcification extending from the surgical site to the level of L5, noted to have increased in size since prior examination.
Multilevel degenerative changes.
MRI of thoracic and lumbar spine [**2197-12-15**]: 1.
Large posterior paraspinal fluid collections, significantly increased in size from the prior MRI two weeks ago, but similar to the CT one day ago.
Within the limits of a non-contrast study, irregular rim around the large collection is in keeping with superimposed infection, and cannot exclude a developing abscess.
Segmental cord deformity at T7-8 with anterior displacement of the cord secondary to a posterior epidural collection, uncertain if it was already present in the prior MRI study.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
RUE LENI [**2198-1-2**]: IMPRESSION:  Resolution of right upper extremity DVT  LUE ultrasound [**2198-1-8**]:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the bilateral lower extremities.

He presented [**11-26**] with sepsis and neck pain and was found to have MRSA wound infection at laminectomy site and MRSA bacteremia requiring ICU admission and pressors.
Course complicated by decompensated [**Month/Year (2) 9215**], 30 beat run of V-tach in context of K+ of 3.2, anemia requiring transfusion of PRBCs, staph aureus pneumonia, bowel pseudoobstruction/ileus, PICC associated DVT, ATN.
Also s/p drainage of paraspinal MRSA-infected hematoma [**12-15**] and debridement of sacral ulcer first in OR on [**12-19**] and then at bedside on [**12-26**].
Debridement of sacral ulcer performed again at that time.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Wound infection and MRSA bacteremia: Patient has a spinal hardware infection s/p T9-S1 laminectomies.
Washout of wound was performed on [**11-26**], dura was intact and wound cultures grew staph aureus sensitive to vanc and corynebacterium.
There was no sign of epidural abscess on MRI.
On [**12-15**] noted on imaging to have paraspinal fluid collection so this was drained by IR with finding of infected hematoma with MRSA.
Decision was made with orthopedics to remove infected hardware and to definitively drain paraspinal abscess in OR on [**1-1**].
The patient's sputum culture grew out coag + staph aureus, and he was treated for presumed MRSA pneumonia.
Azithromycin was added to the patient's regimen per ID recs for possible COPD exacebration.
However, given new O2 requirement on [**12-20**] was started on another course of Cefepime ending on [**12-27**].
# Hypoxia: Patient had 3 liter O2 requirement with O2 sats in the mid to high 90s.
His hypoxia was likely multifactorial and due to pulmonary edema from [**Month/Year (2) 9215**] and volume overload, presumed MRSA pneumonia, atelectasis, and COPD exacerbation.
Repeated CXRs shows bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the left, left lower lobe atelectasis and pulmonary edema.
His sputum culture grew coag + staph aureus, presumed MRSA pneumonia is adequately covered by vancomycin.
The patient is volume overloaded on exam and has [**Last Name (LF) 9215**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was diuresed with good effect on respiratory status, although diuresis was limited by kidney function.
The patient does not have a previous diagnosis of COPD, but he has an extensive smoking history and his exam is concerning for underlying COPD.
We placed him on standing lasix 20mg PO qd for peripheral edema.
On exam his abdomen was tense, distended and tympanic throughout with hyperactive bowel sounds.
The patient had only mild rectal tone and was unable to feel when he passes gas or stool.
This was continued until resolution of abdominal distension and return of spontaneous stooling.
The patient still intermittently complains of abdominal cramping and fullness, and requires multiple bowel medications.
There were no signs of hemolysis and no active source of bleeding was found on examination, serial guaics, or CT abdomen / pelvis.
# [**Month/Year (2) 9215**] and hypervolemia: Hx of diagnosed [**Month/Year (2) 9215**], with volume overload leading to pleural effusions and pulmonary edema on this admission.
Due to hypoxia from pleural effusions on [**12-18**] began aggressive course of diuresis starting [**12-18**] with up to 160mg IV lasix daily.
We placed him on standing lasix 20mg PO qd for peripheral edema.
Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal failure, likely due to decreased effective circulating volume due to [**Last Name (un) 9215**].
Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis.
Due to hypoxia from pleural effusions on [**12-18**] began aggressive course of diuresis starting [**12-18**] with up to 160mg IV lasix daily.
# Catheter associated DVT: Patient had a PICC line in his right arm and was noted to have swelling of his right hand and forearm.
RUE ultrasound revealed a catheter-induced thrombus associated with the PICC line in his right brachial vein.
He showed some LUE swelling on [**12-8**], but a LUE ultrasound showed no evidence of thrombus.
Warfarin 5mg started [**12-11**] but then discontinued due to need for OR interventions.
RUE was rechecked after patient had been on anti-coagulation for one month, and showed interval clot resolution.
Decision made to stop anticoagulation at that time given patient's bleeding risk and lack of data to support continued anticoagulation for PICC related clot in brachial vein only.
# Sacral deep tissue injury: The patient has a sacral deep tissue injury with friable, deep tissue involvement.
Noted to be necrotic and debrided first in OR on [**12-19**] and then at bedside on [**12-26**], then again in OR on [**1-1**].
# Episode of ventricular tachycardia: 30 beat run on [**11-29**] in context of low K of 3.2.
SBP during episode held in 150s and he was asymptomatic.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with PACs afterwards without intervention.
# Back and Neck pain: Acute on chronic pain secondary to nerve compression due to spinal stenosis, multiple surgeries, and recent infection.
Pain was well controlled on this regimen.
Increased amounts of opioids were avoided due to abdominal pain and ileus vs pseudobstruction.
# Chest pain: Transient episode of pleuritic chest pain on the night of [**1-7**].
There were no significant EKG changes and trop t was 0.12 and 0.13.
Troponin negative on admission, was 0.11-0.16 on [**11-15**] (likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of acute infection), with no subsequent troponins drawn since until this episode so elevation may be residual.
# Enterococcus in urine: Patient found to have [**Last Name (un) **] in urine with 10k - 100k organisms / ml; however upon changing the foley the enterococcus bacterial count decreased to [**2185**] organisms/ml without treatment indicating bacterial colonization with [**Year (4 digits) **] and not true UTI.
Repeat culture showed continued enterococcus colonization, but patient without signs of active infection at that point.
Foley changed by urology, repeat culture at time of discharge was positive for enterococcus.
No standing insulin.
His losartan was initially discontinued due to his acute kidney injury, but was restarted prior to discharge.
# BPH:  Patient was continued on home finasteride and tamsulosin with no issues on this admission.
# Polio with residual RLE paralysis: Stable on this admission with no issues.
Foley changed, repeat urine culture at discharge still positive for enterococcus.
Electing not to treat as no clinical signs of UTI and we believe this is chronic bladder colonization # Consider changing labetalol to cardioselective beta blocker such as metoprolol # If worsening abdominal pain and distension and patient not stooling, GI recommends: - Serial rectal exams with stimulation to produce BMs, patient should be rolled on left side for this - Electrolye repletion # Sacral ulcer, continue wound care as follows: Cleanse ulcer with wound cleanser set to "stream" pat dry, use cotton tip swab as needed to remove excess cleanser Prep periwound tissues with No Sting Barrier Wipe and miconazole powder fill ulcer with slightly moistened AMD Kerlix Cover with softsorb dressing Secure with Medipore H soft cloth tape and pink Hy tape to inferior edge change [**Hospital1 **] # Per ortho: TBSO when out of bed.

You were admitted with a surgical site infection of your back.
On [**11-26**], you went to the operating room where infected tissue and pus were removed.
Your course was complicated by bacteria in your bloodstream, kidney injury and pulmonary edema (fluid in your lungs) due to your heart failure.
Over your hospital stay, you developed abdominal distention from a condition we call ileus, which can happen after surgery or severe infection.
