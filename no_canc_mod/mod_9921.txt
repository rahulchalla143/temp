Admission Date:  [**2155-4-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2155-4-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2107-10-19**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain, shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47 year-old female with a history of hypertension, ITP status post splenectomy, and a history of supraventricular tachycardia for which she underwent an electrophysiologic study at [**Hospital1 1444**] [**2155-1-8**].
Her study demonstrated duel pathway physiology and a diseased His-Purkinje system.
No supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia could be induced, however, and no intervention could be initially undertaken.
The patient had a near syncopal event on the telemetry floor the next day in the setting in which her heart rate decreased from 120 to 60.
The patient had an echocardiogram at that time, which disclosed severe left ventricular dysfunction.
Cardiac MRI confirmed markedly depressed left ventricular function, but failed to show any scarring/infarction, therefore the patient was thought to have not ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Given her near syncope and cardiomyopathy the decision was made to place a DDD pacemaker.
The patient did well postoperatively, however, and had no complications until today at 2:30 p.m. when she awoke from a nap with sharp chest pain that radiated to her right shoulder.
The patient also experienced shortness of breath.
She went to an outside hospital where initially concern was for a pulmonary embolus.
The patient underwent CT scan, which demonstrated a large pericardial effusion.
During her time there she developed progressively distended neck veins and hemodynamic instability with systolic blood pressure 60 to 90.
ITP status post splenectomy, hypertension, history of supraventricular tachycardia status post EP study [**2155-1-8**] with diseased His-Purkinje system.
Nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
Echocardiogram [**2155-1-8**] disclosed EF of 25%, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, no pericardial effusion.
Mother died at the age of 35 of an aneurysm and had a history of hypertension.
Father died of myocardial infarction at age 67.
Markedly distended neck veins.
Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Electrocardiogram sinus tachycardia at 111 beats per minute, normal PR intervals, prolonged QTC, normal axis, left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block, T wave inversions in 2, 3 and AVF, V5 and V6, poor R wave progression.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 47 year-old female who presents with acute cardiac tamponade.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Initial right heart catheterization revealed elevated right heart filling pressures with equalization of pressures across the [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
The RA mean pressure was 14 mmHg with an RVEDP and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 mmHg.
Initially pericardial pressure was found to be 15 mmHg, 350 cc of frankly blood fluid was removed with a subsequent decrease in the mean RA pressure to 8 mmHg, a decrease in the mean pericardial pressure to 3 mmHg and a rise in the arterial blood pressure to 165/84/114 mmHg.
A follow up echocardiogram performed in the catheterization laboratory demonstrated complete resolution of the pericardial effusions.
Analysis suggested that the V lead was still present in the RV.
There was no definitive evidence of RV perforation by the V lead.
On [**4-21**] the patient underwent this procedure without complications.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
On [**4-23**] the pericardial drain was discontinued without difficulties.
Echocardiogram did not show evidence of recurrent pericardial effusion.
The etiology of hematocrit drop was unclear, since echocardiogram did not demonstrate accumulation of pericardial fluid.
Compared with prior study of [**4-24**] there has been no significant change.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is instructed to return to the Emergency Department should she experience recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath.
Pericardial tamponade.
Nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
