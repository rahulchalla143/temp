[**2143-10-31**]: Chest Xray - Findings consistent with mild CHF .
[**2143-10-31**]: EKG Sinus tachycardia, RV conduction delay Lateral ST-T changes are nonspecific Since previous tracing of [**2143-9-4**], rate is increased   Brief Hospital Course: In brief, the patient is a 45 year old woman with poorly controlled hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who presented with shortness of breath found to be in hypertensive urgency.
Hypertensive Urgency: There was no evidence of end organ damage (no neurologic deficits and ruled out for MI).
The likely trigger to this hypertensive episode was irregular medication adherence.
Her prior evaluation for causes of secondary hypertension did not reveal evidence consistent with either endocrine or renovascular causes.
During her [**2143-1-30**] evaluation she had an isolated aldosterone level of 37, however, 3 days later the an aldosterone and renin levels were measured (7 and 9.2, respectively) and were not consistent with a primary hyperaldosterone state.
Shortness of Breath: The presenting shortness of breath was likely due to flash pulm edema in the setting of uncontrolled hypertension.
