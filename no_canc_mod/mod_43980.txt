At CCH she was found to be in respiratory distress and was intubated.
Patient was initially on dopamine for low BP but after propofol was switched to fentanyl/midazolam her BP came up and dopamine was weaned off.
CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis/dyskinesis of the distal LV/apex.The inferior wall is akinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
CXR [**2204-6-4**]:  Cardiomegaly, [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] congestion, and bilateral parenchymal opacities most compatible with pulmonary edema.
Renal Transplant US [**2204-6-4**]:  Progression of high resistance pattern of flow within the transplanted kidney with lack of antegrade diastolic flow in the intrarenal and main renal arteries.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2204-6-4**] No evidence of DVT.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2204-6-5**]: Pulmonary edema present on [**6-4**] has substantially improved.
Residual opacification at the lung bases is probably a combination of residual edema, pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Tip of the endotracheal tube, with the chin in neutral or elevation is less than 2 cm from the carina and should be withdrawn 2-3 cm to avoid unilateral intubation.
Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions are larger on the left side associated with atelectasis in the bases of the lungs, left greater than right.
Multiple calcified lung nodules in the right upper lobe are again noted.
Pulmonary edema continues to improve, now mild.
There are no new lung abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 61 yo F with CAD, CHF EF 30%, ESRD s/p transplant now failing, not yet on HD who presented to OSH with dyspnea and was intubated due to pulmonary edema causing respiratory distress.
Respiratory distress: Patient presented to OSH with dyspnea and was intubated due to respiratory distress.
A CXR showed pulmonary edema and her BNP was measured at [**Numeric Identifier 104608**].
Felt to be secondary to worsening renal function causing oliguria, fluid overload and pulmonary edema due to fluid poor cardiac reserve.
Unclear as to cause of acute change but failing transplant is most likely.
Renal ultrasound showed progression of high resistance pattern of flow within the transplanted kidney with lack of antegrade diastolic flow in the intrarenal and main renal arteries.
Congestive Heart Failure: A cardiolgy evaluation was performed while she was in the MICU given her history of worsening SOB and fluid overload on admission.
An echocardiogram was performed on this admission which showed overall left ventricular systolic function that is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis/dyskinesis of the distal LV/apex and an akinectic inferior wall.
She is not longer hypervolemic on exam and her SOB has resolved.
Hypotension: Presented with low BP in setting of propofol.
Anemia:  felt to be secondary to decreased eyrhtropoesis.
Sceleroderma:  not an active issue while inpatient.
