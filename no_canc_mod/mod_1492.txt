Admission Date:  [**2121-10-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-10-30**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Motrin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint: HYPOTENSION / BRADYCARDIA  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 10829**] is an 89 year old woman with HTN, COPD, mild aortic stenosis, paroxysmal afib (on coumadin), hypothyroidism, and recent gram negative bacteremia (pseudomonas), presenting with nausea, vomiting, hypotension and bradycardia one day after discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] after a complicated stay.
Patient has had repeated admission in the recent past, most recently after presenting with dyspnea on exertion and nausea.
She was found to have positive blood cultures, ([**1-15**]) for pseudomonas.
Today, patient was found hypotensive and bradycardic at her nursing home, with SBP in 80's and HR in the 50's.
Shortly thereafter, patient became bradycardic with HR to 30's and BP to 80's.
ECG obtained revealed complete heart block with junctional escape rhythm.
Patient was given atropine x 2, glucagon with little improvement.
Patient continued having nausea and vomiting, and was obtunded.
CT Torso was obtained, which was only remarkable for a small left pleural effusion and bilateral shoulder effusions.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: [**2115**] CARDIAC CATH WITHOUT CAD -PACING/ICD: .
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Peripheral vascular disease Mild Mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension Severe Tricuspid regurgitation Mild Aortic stenosis (Valve area 1.3cm2, peak gradient 19mm Hg) Aortic regurgitation Mild cognitive impairment.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: Cold extremities, no splinter hemorrhages, no osler nodes or [**Last Name (un) **] lesions.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Interval improvement in bilateral small pleural effusions.
Small right renal hypodensity, too small to be fully characterized, likely represents a cyst.
ECHO [**2121-10-23**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-10-15**], the findings are similar with less tricuspid regurgitation and lower estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
Extensive right hemispheric infarct involving the anterior and middle cerebral artery distributions.
CT perfusion demonstrates delayed transit time, reduced blood flow and reduced blood volume in this region.
Occlusion of the intracranial portion of the right internal carotid artery.
ART DUP EXT [**2121-10-24**]: Focal right brachial arterial thrombus at the level of the antecubital fossa.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2121-10-25**]: Edema of the right hemisphere with mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle and 4 mm leftward shift of midline structures.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient presented with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypothermia.
Patient was intubated in ER due to concern of airway protection secondary to nausea, vomiting and decreased mental status.
Bradycardia thought to be secondary to nodal medications (Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], Verapamil 120 mg Tablet PO Q24H) in setting of worsening renal function.
Patient was on nodal agents for A Fib and history of tachycardia.
Hypotension and hypothermia on admission were attributed to sepsis, supported by elevated white count and recent discharge for pseudomonas bacteremia.
On [**2121-10-24**] patient entered A Fib and demonstrated decreased L sided movement.
On exam, she had R preferential gaze with L hemiplegia and neglect.
CT of head was obtained urgently showing R ACA/MCA infarct with dense R MCA most likely cardioembolic secondary to Afib.
Given the extensive infarct with evidence of completion plus the fact that she was already anticoagulated with INR 2.0 she was not given lytics (IA tPA) due to high likelihood of hemorrhagic transformation with such intervention.
Patient became non-verbal.
