Flat Lesions A single small angioectasia was seen in the ascending colon that started oozing upon examination.
There were 2 small AVM's noted in the transverse colon that were not bleeding.
A gold probe was applied for hemostasis successfully to the ascending colon AVM.
Other There were [**1-26**] cords of engorged veins noted in the rectum suggestive of rectal varices.
There was no active bleeding noted in this area.
Impression: Angioectasia in the ascending colon (thermal therapy) Abnormal mucosa in the colon There were [**1-26**] cords of engorged veins noted in the rectum suggestive of rectal varices.
There was no active bleeding noted in this area.
Consider small bowel capsule study to evaluate small bowel for AVM's.
It was explained that colon cancer and colon polyps on rare occasions may be missed during a colonoscopy.The procedure was done with attending physician and GI fellow.
Protruding Lesions Trace varices that flattened with air insufflation were noted at the GE junction.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Patchy mild erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance of the mucosa were noted in the fundus, stomach body and antrum.
These findings are compatible with mild portal gastropathy.
Impression: Esophageal varices Erythema in the gastroesophageal junction Erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance in the fundus, stomach body and antrum compatible with mild portal gastropathy Normal mucosa in the first part of the duodenum and second part of the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: 1.
