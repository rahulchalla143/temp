Assess for ligamentous injury.
Axial and sagittal T2-weighted images demonstrate the fractures at the base of the odontoid process and of the transverse processes of the C4 vertebral body.
However, these fractures are better visualized on the earlier CT C- spine examination At the C4- C5 level, there is mild protrusion of the intervertebral disc anteriorly.
Sagittal STIR images demonstrate a thin line of high- signal intensity material extending from this level (C4-5) along the anterior aspect of the C5, C6 and C7 vertebral bodies consistent with a tiny amount of edema or hematoma in the area of the anterior longitudinal ligmaent.
STIR images also demonstrate high- signal intensity in the interspinous regions of the posterior elements of C2, C3 and C4 indicative of edema, and may also reflect underlying ligamentous sprain versus tear.
The intervertebral disc spaces and the neural foramina of the cervical spine are otherwise within normal limits.
No evidence of spinal cord contusion.
Mild anterior longitudinal ligament edema versus hematoma along the C4-C6 vertebral bodies may reflect underlying anterior longitudinal ligament injury.
High signal within the soft tissues and posterior elements of C2, C3 and C4 could also reflect a underlying ligamentous injury.
Assess for vertebral artery involvement.
FINDINGS: Please refer to the CTs of the cervical spine and brain respectively from the same date for full details.
In summary there is comminuted right clavicular fracture.
There is a minimally displaced comminuted fracture of C2.
There are bilateral facet fractures of C4 with a fracture of the left transverse process involving the transversarium foramen.
Images from the neck to the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrate no focal areas of stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation of the carotid or vertebral arteries respectively.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of vertebral artery injury.
FINDINGS: Two views of the left knee demonstrate no fracture or dislocation.
No effusion is detected.
FINDINGS: There is a comminuted fracture of the mid right clavicle.
A diplaced fracture of the base of first right metacarpal is also identified.
No evidence of right shoulder dislocation on limited single view.
IMPRESSION: Fracture of the mid right clavicle and base of the right first metacarpal.
No pleural or pericardial effusion is detected.
No mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
19 x11 mm soft tissue density is seen in the anterior mediastinum, likely representing residual thymic tissue.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The liver shows no focal lesion.
No free fluid, free air, or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
No pelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified.
Note is made of a comminuted fracture of the mid right clavicle.
IMPRESSION: Comminuted fracture of the right mid clavicle.
Specifically, no evidence of intra- abdominal parenchymal organ injury or free fluid.
TECHNIQUE: Contrast MDCT acquired axial images of the cervical spine and skull base to the level of C2.
FINDINGS: A minimally displaced comminuted fracture of the dens is identified (essentially type 3).
A fracture is also identified within the left pedicle, facet and lamina of C4.
The facet fracture involves both the superior and inferior articular aspects.
A fracture through the right facet joint is also present, again involving the superior and inferior articular facets.
The fracture of the left transverse process involves the foramen transversarium and therefore there is suspicion of vertebral artery injury.
There are concerns regarding injury of the cord or ligamentous fractures and MRI is recommended.
Incidental note is made of a comminuted and displaced right distal [**2-10**] clavicle fracture.
Minimally displaced comminuted fracture of C2 (type 3).
Fracture of the left transverse process involves the transversarium foramen.
Therefore, if there is suspicion of injury to the vertebral artery, then MRA is recommended for further evaluation.
Given the extent of injury, an MRI should be obtained to evaluate for ligamentous and/or spinal cord injury.
Comminuted and displaced right clavicle fracture.
No occult fractures are identified.
There is mild mucosal thickening within bilateral maxillary sinuses, consistent with chronic sinus disease.
Note is made of extensive injury to the scalp with exposure of the calvarium, including a degloving injury to the front of the scalp.
A large subgaleal hematoma is present at the vertex.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Orthopedics and Orthopedic Spine Surgery were consulted because of her hand and cervical spine injuries.
She underwent stabilization of her cervical fractures on [**7-26**].
There were no intraoperative complications.
She was taken to the OR on [**7-29**] for ORIF of her right 1st metacarpal; there were no intraoperative complications.
