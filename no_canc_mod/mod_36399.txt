HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year old white male with a past medical history of seizure disorder on Tegretol and mental retardation among others.
The patient was noted to have multiple abrasions over his body.
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 336**] last week with a change in mental status.
His mental status there was described as awake, alert, but minimally attentive.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed severe erosive esophagitis, question of [**Female First Name (un) 564**], and small gastric polyps.
Chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe pneumonia and bilateral apical opacities.
CT of the spine was negative for any cervical spine fractures.
Mental retardation.
Seizure disorder secondary to meningitis as a child.
Fecal incontinence.
Recent upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to erosive esophagitis.
Atrial fibrillation.
Fluconazole  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No petechiae.
Bilateral periorbital erythema and edema.
No Battle sign.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen is soft, normoactive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended, no organomegaly.
Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, pulses 2+ bilaterally.
Neurologically, the patient is moving all four extremities, withdraws to pain, no posturing, no corneal or gag reflex (but on Propofol).
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, PR interval 204 consistent with first degree AV block, left atrial enlargement, QRS 140, Q-Tc 450, peaked T waves, 1.0 to 2.
[**Street Address(2) 27948**] elevation in V1, V2, but pattern is left bundle branch block, no T wave inversions, Q wave only in lead III.
IMAGING STUDIES:  CT of the head revealed cerebellar atrophy, mucosal thickening of maxillary and ethmoid sinus.
CT spine revealed normal alignment of vertebra, no fractures, no subluxation, positive degenerative changes in C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7.
Chest x-ray revealed hazy opacities in the bilateral apices and right lower lobe - ?
Toxicology - The patient was noted to have elevated Carbamazepine levels.
The patient most likely had a Carbamazepine overdose (question intentional or confused or due to interaction with fluconazole, recently begun for candidiasis).
Cardiology - The patient had a new widening of the QRS on initial electrocardiogram and this was likely related to sodium channel blocking activity of Tegretol.
Pulmonary - Due to the patient's findings on chest x-ray of right lower lobe and bilateral apical opacities, he was assumed to have suffered an aspiration event causing aspiration pneumonia.
No complications after extubation.
He also had elevated creatinine kinase enzyme levels around 10,000.
This was most likely rhabdomyolysis and resolved with hydration and bicarbonate and eventually the CKs trended downward.
The elevated creatinine normalized within the first couple of days around [**2100-11-4**], and was postulated to be due to acute renal failure secondary to severe hydration.
Gastrointestinal - His recent gastrointestinal bleed at [**Hospital 14852**] secondary to erosive esophagitis prompted nasogastric tube lavage on admission in the Emergency Department which was clear.
Neurology - The patient's altered mental status was likely secondary to the Tegretol overdose.
His CT of the head was negative for any acute process.
Cerebrospinal fluid cultures for HSV and urine toxicology screens were negative, not consistent with these as possible etiologies of altered mental status.
The patient was also while intubated on Propofol and thus not allowing assessment of his current mental status.
A few days later, a CT was done of the head again which showed minimal intraventricular and subarachnoid blood.
Neurology recommendations included electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance scan to further workup altered mental status.
Both were bloody with increased protein, however, CT of the head initially did not reveal an acute bleed.
Trauma - He was seen by trauma surgery to be evaluated for cervical spine instability; they recommended that he be kept in a cervical collar even though he had no fracture, since ligamentous injury was not ruled out at the time.
He will follow-up with neurosurgery a week or two after discharge when he will be reevaluated with flexion and extension films as well as a head CT to follow his subarachnoid blood and intraventricular blood seen on CT of the head on [**2100-11-4**].
Initially, it was felt that these may be trauma induced erosions versus herpetic erosions.
DFA for HSV type I and type II as well as ZBZ were negative except for an HSV type I DFA which was positive.
All other cultures of the wound were negative and Acyclovir, which was started empirically when dermatology first saw him for HSV, was discontinued when these cultures and DFA came back negative.
They also were questioning the fact that his Carbamazepine level of 33 implied overingestion, suggesting possible assault or possible suicide attempt.
The hypothesis that was generated was that perhaps the patient had a seizure and overdosed with Tegretol during postictal confusion.
He did not know anything about the overingestion of the Tegretol, however, he did deny assault or suicidal attempts.
At the time of discharge, the patient was not considered to have any psychiatric issues as he was cheerful and responsive to questions.
His issues of Tegretol overdose as well as rhabdomyolysis were resolved and levels of Tegretol as well as CKs were trending downward towards normal limits.
As aspiration pneumonia continued to be treated with Levofloxacin and Clindamycin for a fourteen day course.
Neurology: he had a repeat head CT done on the day of transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the floor which was not different from the [**2100-11-4**] study and was notable for perhaps a slightly larger bleed ("subdural fluid collection").
It was decided that a repeat CT would be done one to two weeks after discharge when following up with neurosurgery unless there was significant clinical deterioration.
During his continued hospital course, he had no neurological deficits, no signs of central nervous system infection.
for his hypertension and was switched to Atenolol 100 mg q.d.
Nutrition - The patient had a nasogastric tube in since the Medical Intensive Care Unit stay and due to aspiration pneumonia history as well as neck instability, tube feeds were started on this patient two days after he reached the floor in efforts to give him nutrition.
For the first couple of days, he failed the swallow studies with signs and symptoms of aspiration upon taking thin liquids.
