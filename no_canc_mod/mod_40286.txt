Occ fracture extending to the foramen magnum).
Due to fever and concern for aspiration PNA, sputum cultures were sent, blood culture negative thus far.
Subsequent CT head showed no significant change.
ABX was dc'd as sputum showed 2+GPCpc/2+GPR/sparse yeast and no fever.
Of note, CT Torso showed left upper lobe lung mass and subcarinal enlarged node is seen.
There is also a calcified left ventricle aneurysm with thrombus.
Multiple hypodensities in Splenic, left renal and left upper quadrant concerning for metastases.

There could be some blood at the midbrain with effacement.
No hydrocephalus noted.
CTA Head: Pre-lim read prior to recons: negative for aneurysm.
Massive subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Bilateral subdural hemorrhages.
Occipital fracture extending to the foramen magnum.
Ct C-spine - No CT evidence for acute fracture or malalignment.
However, severe degenerative changes puts the patient at risk for cord contusion even with minor trauma  [**10-6**] CT C/A/P - 1.
Left upper lobe lung mass and subcarinal enlarged node is seen.
There ias also a calcified left ventricle aneurysm with thrombus.
Splenic, left renal and left upper quadrant complex hypodensities, concerning for metastases.
Head CT has shown diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with small bilateral subdural hematomas.
The subarachnoid hemorrhage is predominantly seen at the convexity but also seen in the right sylvian fissure greater than left side.
No occipital fracture is seen.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates no definite aneurysm, vascular occlusion, or high-grade stenosis.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrates vascular calcifications, but no evidence of high-grade stenosis or occlusion in the carotid or vertebral arteries.
[**2181-10-8**] CT BRAIN FINDINGS: In comparison to [**2181-10-7**] examination, there has been no substantial change in the extent of the widespread multicompartmental hemorrhages.
Bilateral subdural collections are again evident.
Subarachnoid blood, distributed throughout the bilateral frontoparietal and temporal regions, with clot forming in the right sylvian fissure, does not appear substantially increased from the prior examination.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
A small amount of layering intraventricular blood is evident, with no significant change in ventricular size or shape to suggest developing hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: Extensive multicompartmental, including subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage, as well as small amount of intraventricular blood, stable when compared to the study from [**2181-10-7**].
[**2181-10-9**] CXR Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung is probably largely pulmonary edema, since perihilar edema was already present in the left lung yesterday and has worsened.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable and there has been a slight increase in mediastinal vascular caliber, which could be a reflection of supine positioning rather than an indication of elevated central venous pressure or volume.
Left lower lobe consolidation has worsened in the interim.
Whether this is pneumonia or active aspiration, or atelectasis or even asymmetric pulmonary edema is radiographically indeterminate.
Left upper lobe mass is a known feature.
Transvenous right atrial and left ventricular pacer leads and right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead are in standard placements.
Calcified apical ventricular aneurysm is also longstanding.
But cleared on [**10-10**] after no reports of neck pain and no fracture.
The patient was admitted initially by neurosurgery and subsequently transfered to medicine for further evaluation of multiple medical conditions.
Neuro:   CTA of the brain was obtained but did not demonstrate evidence of aneurym.
Repeat CT imaging of his brain demonstrated persistent b/l sub dural hematoma's and worsening diffuse SAH.
It was noted he was also having fevers and elevated white count.
Per laboratory evaluation, it was noted that he had pancreatitis and developed ilieus with colonic distension.
Pulmonary: Plain CXR imaging was suspicous for aspiration, thus sputum was sent which showed GP rods and cocci.
He underwent CT toros to rule out additional injury.
This was significant for LUL lung mass concerning for malignancy.
At the time of discharge the wife and HCP as well as the patient's daughter were not inclined towards invasive diagnostic procedures and the mass was not further evaluated.
He was treated with Vanc/cefepime for presumed VAP due to his MS decline.
Cardiac: CT torso showed a also a calcified left ventricle with aneurysm and thrombus.
Further evaluation of left ventricular thrombus would require TEE and based on families desires to avoid invasive procedures was not indicated at this time.
CT Torso: Splenic, left renal and left upper quadrant complex hypodensities, concerning for metastases.
The underlying pathology of these hypodensities remains unclear though may be due to abdominal visceral or lung metasteses.
At the time of discharge, the wife [**Name (NI) 382**] and daughter were not interested in invasive diagnostic procedures and this was not further evaluated.
Hematology: Plavix and Aspirin was stopped due to head injury.
The elevated INR was thought to be due to poor nutrition; DIC was unlikely given the stability of the patient and the normal platelet count.
Renal: He had acute renal insufficanty and developed hypernatremia over the course of his hospital stay.
His renal failure resolved and his creatinine returned to his baseline of 1.3.
The etiology of his hypernatremia was initially unclear.
However, partial diabetes could not be excluded based on his urine osms in the mid400s.

You also sustained a skull fracture.
You also had a cat scan of your body to assess for other injury.
Incedentally found was a lung mass in the left upper lobe with masses in spleen and thyroid.
You were also noted to have pancreatitis, Ilieus, fever from aspiration pneumonia.
