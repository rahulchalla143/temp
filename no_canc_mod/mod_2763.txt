He does have a significant DVT/PE history, but because he has an IVC filter and INR was supra-therapeutic when his symptoms began, suspicion for PE was low.
Admission Chest CT showed bilateral effusions and bilateral LL opacities, which may represent infection, edema, or atelectasis.
Admission labs showed elevated CKMB and mildly elevated troponin.
EKG was not consistent with acute MI.
Given than he had been afebrile and with minimal cough, he did not receive antibiotics.
The patient was given lasix 20mg IV x2 and met goal UOP of 1-2L negative, with improvement in symptomatic dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
TTE showed global dysfunction, dilated CM.
W/u for global CM performed with no idenitifiable cause obtained.
Underwent cardiac cath which showed minimal disease.
Started on Coreg with success in HTN control.
# PE PPx: On coumadin on admission.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Shortness of breath, secondary to systolic Congestive Heart Failure  Discharge Condition: Improved, INR therapeutic, hemodynamically stable   Discharge Instructions: You were evaluated in the hospital for your shortness of breath and recent changes in your heart function.
You were found to have a dilated heart that has reduced efficiency in its ability to pump blood as well as it did several months ago.
It remains unclear why this occurred, but cardiology was able to perform a cardiac catheterization that showed you only a small amount of disease in the arteries that supply blood to your heart.
Please call your doctor or return to the ER with: * Worsening of your shortness of breath * Chest pain or pressure * Fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting * With any new concerns  Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] on Thursday, [**2-5**] at 2PM to discuss the details of your hospitalization and check your INR.
