Of note:   DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms [**Known lastname 48243**] has a new diagnosis of anti-Dantu alloantibody and warm and cold autoantibodies.
Ms [**Known lastname 48243**] also has a diagnosis of warm and cold autoantibodies.
These autoantibodies may or may not be associated with hemolysis and serologic results should be correlated with clinical findings.
Please contact the [**Name2 (NI) **] bank as soon as possible when transfusion is being considered.
To faciliate future serologic testing, we will provide, when available, [**Name2 (NI) **] matched to the patient for major Rh and [**Doctor Last Name **] antigens.

She was placed on unasyn as coverage for her cholangitis.
Her foley catheter was discontinued on HD #4 and she has been voiding without difficulty.
She did have another episode of atrial fibrillation prior to her transfer to the floor on [**4-12**], this resovled with intravenous metoprolol.
She did have anx-ray taken of her hands which did show osteo-arthitis and lesions suggestive of tophaceous gout.
During the course of her hospitalization, she did have an elevation in her creatinine up to 2-2.2 and her medications were reviewed as a potential source.
On HOD #8, she reported flank pain and was found to have a worsening of her liver function tests and a elevation in her white [**Month/Day (4) **] cell count.
On HOD # 12 she underwent an ERCP which showed multiple large stones and a biliary stent was placed.
She did have difficulty voiding and it was replaced.
Because of her difficulty voiding, her foley catheter will remain in place.
