Coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed no  significant coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was short and had no angiographically-apparent coronary disease.
The LCX was a large dominant vessel without obstructive coronary disease.
The RCA was a small vessel and also was normal.
The LVEDP was elevated at 20 mm Hg suggestive of moderate diastolic dysfunction.
There was no aortic stenosis on left-heart pullback.
Moderate diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.
No aortic stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 80 yo M hx non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, HTN, recent VT/torsades storm who returns with recurrence of torsades.
No evidence of active ischemia and cath did not show evidence of ischemic lesion.
Other potential reasons for recurrence include hypokalemia and missing mexilletine.
K may have been somewhat low in the setting of stress and catecholamine driven intracellular shift.
Please [**Month/Day/Year **] to his primary care provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) 488**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8719**], Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8725**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Long QT syndrome Ventricular Tachycardia / Torsades de points chronic systolic heart failure diabetes mellitus type II   Discharge Condition: Good, no further ventricular arrhythmias.
