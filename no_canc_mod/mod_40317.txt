Admission Date:  [**2125-12-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2125-12-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-2-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: right-sided weakness, depressed level of consciousness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 54 year old woman with a history of [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease and hyperlipidemia who presents with right-sided weakness, depressed level of consciousness, and disconjugate gaze.
She was found by her son at home around 11:00 AM; at that time, she was sprawled on the floor and complained about not being able to get up due to her right leg being weak, but she did not recall how she came to be on the floor or why she fell.
When he helped her stand up, she could not bear weight on her right leg and it repeatedly buckled.
The medical team there pursued a lumbar puncture, but just after the study the patient experienced an episode of severe bradycardia and hypotension.
She and her son deny any major antecedent illnesses or symptoms except that she had a recent dental infection requiring antibiotics.
She denies ever having had a stroke or seizure in the past.
Unable to fully obtain ROS due to depressed level of consciousness, but the patient endorses right-sided weakness and malaise.
Head/Neck: NC/AT, no conjunctival icterus, no oropharyngeal lesions, no meningismus Cardiovascular: RRR, no murmurs/rubs/gallops Pulmonary: Equal air entry bilaterally, no crackles or wheezes Abdomen: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no guarding Extremities: Warm, no edema, palpable radial/dorsalis pedis pulses Skin: No rashes or lesions  NIH Stroke Scale - Total [7] 1a.
Left eye medially deviated at rest, does not bury sclera with extreme left lateral gaze.
End-gaze right-beating nystagmus with left lateral gaze and upgaze, rapid nystagmus on extreme right lateral gaze.
[VII] Right lower face weakness with smile, mild R NLF flattening at rest.
No tremor or asterixis.
No extinction.
- Coordination - No dysmetria with FTN bilaterally  - Gait - unable to assess .
Urine: [**2125-12-8**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING EMERGENCY [**Hospital1 **] [**2125-12-8**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2125-12-10**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Radiology: CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT BRAIN PERFUSION Study Date of [**2125-12-8**] 1:33 AM CT HEAD: There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.
CT PERFUSION HEAD: Symmetric perfusion is identified bilaterally without evidence of regional areas of abnormalities in the transit time or blood volume.
The distal right vertebral artery is not visualized above the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, which likely appears to be due to congenital variation.
However, there is a small non-opacified portion of the distal vertebral artery seen between the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and basilar artery, since of high density, this is unlikely to be thrombosis.
IMPRESSION: Although CT angiography does not demonstrate vascular occlusion, a non-opacified portion of the distal right vertebral artery beyond posterior inferior cerebellar artery is seen which is likely due to hypoplasia of the right vertebral artery.
However, MRI can help for further assessment if clinically indicated to exclude ischemia or intrinsic abnormalities within the vertebral artery, which can be seen on the MRI examination.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-12-8**] 3:13 AM ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST: The lungs are low in volume and show a left lower lobe opacity.
No definite pleural effusions are present.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity could represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, though no evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
MRI/MRA HEAD/NECK W&W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2125-12-9**] 2:35 PM FINDINGS: There is reduced diffusion seen in the right lateral medulla associated with abnormal T2 signal, suggestive of an acute infarct.
There is no signal abnormalities seen on the gradient echo sequence to suggest hemorrhagic component.
There is no intracranial mass, mass effect, edema or hemorrhage seen.
There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift.
Bilateral paranasal sinuses, orbits and mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
MRA HEAD: Bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries are patent with no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, dissection or aneurysm formation.
Left vertebral artery appears dominant and shows normal flow signal with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
MRA OF THE NECK: Bilateral common carotid and internal carotid arteries demonstrate normal flow signal with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
Left vertebral artery appears dominant.
IMPRESSION: Acute right lateral medullary infarct.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2125-12-10**] at 12:53:30 PM Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION Biatrial enlargement.
Trace aortic regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
No definite structural cardiac source of embolism identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 54RHF h/o hyperlipidemia and [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease s/p thyroid ablation p/w right sided weakness and dysequilibrium with nausea and vomiting.
On examination, she initially had a right hemiparesis, right facial droop, right Horner's with dissociated spinothalamic sensory loss - right face and left arm and leg, ritht nystagmus with vertical skew deviation of eyes, dysarthria without dysphagia and right mild cerebellar signs.
CTA/CTP head and neck showed no clear abnormalities.
The patient was admitted to the neuro ICU [**12-8**] and was initially lethargic and had bradycardia and up to 6s sinus pauses with prolonged QTc 600ms and hypotension which settled after IVF.
Her clinical status improved with improved lethargy and no further cardiac events with QTc improving to normal on serial ECGs.
Cardiology consult felt this was likely due to n/v with subsequent increased vagal tone.
Bradycardia and pauses ceased after 24 hours.
CXR showed left base shadowing which was felt possibly related to atelectasis vs aspiration during her vomiting.
No treatment required.
She had MRI/MRA head and neck which showed a right lateral medullary infarct with a PICA termination of right vertebral artery.
Echo [**12-10**] showed no VSD/ASD or PFO and otherwise demonstrated biatrial enlargement and trace AR.
She had borderline hypertension with SBP 140s-150s and was started on low dose lisinopril.
Discharge Instructions:  Dear Mrs. [**Known lastname 2427**], You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of vomiting, dizziness, and right-sided weakness.
It was determined that you had a stroke in your brainstem, the right lateral medulla.
The most likely cause of this is an arterio-arterioembolic event from atherosclerotic disease of your arteries.
You were at higher risk for this due to high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
Your blood pressures were slightly elevated during your stay.
