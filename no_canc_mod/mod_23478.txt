History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] is a 19-year-old man with a history of seizure disorder, presenting with rash and fever.
He did not lose control of his bladder or bowel or injure himself.
One month laterm after four weeks of Dilantin, he developed a full body rash and intense puritis.
He was seen at [**Hospital3 **] hospital and started on atarax, oral prednisone, and an H2 blocker, with some mild improvement.
Since his first presenation, he waxed and waned in terms of his rash, itchiness and fatigue.
Three days ago, he had acute worsening of his symptoms.
He had body aches, headache, neck stiffness, fevers and rigors.
His itching worsened and his feet started to swell and hurt to the point where he had trouble walking.
He had swelling in face, mild lip swelling, but no tongue swelling or funny feeling in his mouth.
At [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, presenting again, he had 30% bandemia and LFTs were elevated.
He related the above and denied shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, dizziness, fainting, dysuria, blood in his stools or weight changes.
He doesn't have a hx of liver disease per him.
He had never been treated for seizures before.
In the ICU, ee had mild RUQ tenderness and had an abdominal ultrasound that was normal.
No pain at this time.
His feet are the most itchy and feel slightly swollen.
Family History: No history of SJS or other skin disease.
No family history of seizure disorder, parasomnias, Parkinson's disease, other neurologic illness.

Pertinent Results: Skin biopsy [**2147-3-9**] Interface dermatitis with mild epidermal spongiosis, focal erythrocyte extravasation, and superficial to mid dermal perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammation with scattered eosinophils (see note).
Note:  The findings are consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction such as to drug, and they fit within the spectrum reported for DRESS (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms).
Some atypia is noted within the inflammatory infiltrate and is favored to represent the reactive atypia that may be seen in lymphocytes in the context of DRESS; slides reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] (Hematopathology), who concurs with this interpretation.
Apoptotic keratinocytes are infrequent, and erythema multiforme is not favored; however, an early or evolving erythema multiforme cannot be entirely excluded, and if clinical suspicion persists or other concerning features are noted clinically, additional sampling may be helpful for further diagnostic evaluation.
Non-diagnostic inferior and lateral Q waves.
Mild J point and ST segment elevation, pobably normal early repolarization.
There is no radiographic evidence of  mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, and lungs are clear.
There is no pleural effusion or concerning skeletal findings.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of lymphadenopathy.
Abdominal x-ray FINDINGS: No evidence of free air, fecal filling of the descending colon.
The non-distended gas-filled small bowel loops, partly with minimal air fluid levels.
No pathological calcifications.
Abdominal US: ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in echogenicity without focal lesions.
The gallbladder is collapsed without stones, sludge, wall edema, or pericholecystic fluid.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
There is no abdominal ascites.
There are no stones, masses, or hydronephrosis.
Reference Range:  No antibody detected.
Negative results do not rule out B. burgdorferi infection.
Patients       in early stages of infection or on antibiotic therapy may not produce       detectable levels of antibody.
Patients with clinical history and/or       symptoms suggestive of lyme disease should be retested in [**1-25**] weeks.
It is not approved for diagnosis of acute HIV       infection.
In symptomatic acute HIV infection (acute retroviral syndrome), the       viral load is usually very high (>>1000 copies/mL).
It is recommended that any NEW positive HIV-1 viral load result, in       the absence of positive serology, be confirmed by submitting a new       sample FOR HIV-1 PCR, in addition to serological testing.
Rash   Mr [**Known lastname 732**] was seen by dermatology and allergy and thought to be likely due to hypersensitivity to dilantin.
Phenytoin hypersensitivity actually accounts for all manifestations and would be the most elegant explanation.
Skin biopsy may be of assistance.
Pathology report from skin biopsy, not finalized, but available: "Interface dermatitis with mild epidermal spongiosis, focal erythrocyte extravasation, and superficial to mid dermal perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammation with scattered eosinophils (see note)."
Laboratory findings were essentially only consistent with DRESS/Dilantin hypersensitivity.
Rash and other symptoms clear quickly.
Fevers   Had two to three days of fevers in conjunction with the rash, however he was afebrile in the MICU for his 1st 24 hours.
As above, a number of labs were sent to determine possible infective causes.
Body aches / headache   Likely related to flu-like syndrome associated with reaction, as part of DRESS.
Body aches improved over MICU course and with ibuprofen as needed.
Elevated LFTs   No history liver disease or alcohol abuse.
Intermediate levels consistent with viremia, but excluded on testing.
Anemia   Unclear etiology, iron studies not consistent necessarily with iron deficiency anemia.
Abdominal Pain   Appeared on first day of hospitalisation and was improved by steroids.
Given normal KUB and AUS, we now think that this likely represented para-aortic and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, perhaps mesenteric adenopathy.
He was briefly given opioids, but later required no pain medications.
'Seizures'   Differential includes REM sleep behavior disorder, night terrors, restless legs symdrome with periodic limb movements and epilepsies - most likely of which is familial nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy.
The description was classic for nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy.
The age of onset for NFLE is correct, but this may well be non-familial, or we may not understand his pedigree or relatives' history well (also not completely penetrant or noticed).
REM sleep behavior disorder not consistent with history (no narcoleptic symptoms).
To determine the frequency and severity of hypersensitivity reactions to phenytoin, we reviewed 38 cases of proven reactions.
The pseudolymphoma syndrome (fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy) occurred in nine patients.
Diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for itching.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms/signs, subtype phenytoin hypersensitivity reaction.
Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent  Discharge Instructions: You came to the hosptial with a rash and fever.
You were treated with antihistamines and steroids with good relief.
