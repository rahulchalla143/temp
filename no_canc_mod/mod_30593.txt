However, the single frontal view shows no definite tracheal abnormality.
Cardiac silhouette is somewhat prominent and there is indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
No acute focal pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course: Pt is an 81 y/o F with a long history of angioedema, known difficult airway, and hx of tracheostomy in [**2163-2-22**] after severe angioedema flare.
Pt initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] for increased lip and tongue swelling and sore throat, and received treatment (nebulized epinephrine, benadryl, sc epinephrine, and iv solumedrol.)
Pt was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED given history of difficult airway.
Hoarse voice persisted, but pt denied any difficulty breathing, and was tolerating  PO's on day of discharge.
Pt had had a sore throat since 2 days prior to admission, with mildly productive cough, and these symptoms were improved during her stay.
A viral URI may likely have been the trigger for her angioedema exacerbation.
During admission, she did not require any additional epinephrine or solumedrol.
She was seen by an allergist, and was discharged with 2 days total of Prednisone 40mg daily, with a prescription for 60mg x 3 days available for future flares.
Prednisone 20 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO once a day as needed for angioedema flare: Please take 60mg daily for up to 3 days for an angioedema flare.
Pt was tolerating PO intake, hemodynamically stable, and breathing without difficulty.
You will want to formulate a plan for any future flares with your allergy doctor.
