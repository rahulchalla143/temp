No evidence of pneumothorax.
The left basal pleural tube has been removed and there is no pneumothorax or accumulation of appreciable pleural fluid.
Left lower lobe remains collapsed.
Very small right pleural effusion is present.
Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged.
[**2157-6-4**] One of the left apical chest tubes has been removed.
No significant pneumothorax is identified.
There is a left retrocardiac opacity which is unchanged.
There is no signs for overt pulmonary edema.
[**2157-6-2**] There is slight increase in left basal atelectasis which might be explained at least in part by low lung volumes most likely due to termination of mechanical ventilation.
The pacemaker obscures part of the left hemithorax but within the limitations of this study, no overt pneumothorax is demonstrated.
Small amount of subcutaneous air is seen in the left chest wall.
The lower left chest tube is seen, also unchanged in location compared to the prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient had a left pleuroscopy, pleural biopsy, talc pleurodesis and pleur ex catheter placed on [**5-27**] for recurrent L pleural, by Interventional Pulmonology who admitted him.
Pleural fluid was lymphocytic exudate.
At this time he had some L chest and LUQ pain, lightheartedness.
He was transfused RBC for acute blood loss anemia He was transferred to the MICU.
CXR showed increased left pleural effusion.
CT of the chest showed Large 16 x 15 x 14 cm left subpulmonic hemorrhage.
He was transfused FFP and pRBCs (acute blood loss anemia).
Repeat chest CT showed persistent large hemothorax.
On [**6-1**], he was taken to the OR for L VATS hemothorax evacuation and bronchoscopy with aspiration.
He transferred to the 2 chest tube were to suction with serous drainage.
He was followed by serial chest films which ed showed a stable small left lower lobe effusion and atelectasis.
Rheumatology saw him on [**2157-6-6**] for an acute flare of gout bilateral knees.
