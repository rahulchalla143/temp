The patient reports he was feeling fine until this morning when he began to have chills at 2:30 am.
He subsequently had 3 episodes of non-bilious emesis.
He reports that he has not had any ostomy output since yesterday evening.

One drain remains in place to drain a known fluid collection.
On admission, an NGT was placed, and on KUB to assess placement there was noted to be paucity of bowel gas, with some gaseous distention of right lower quadrant small bowel loops: cannot exclude obstruction.
An abdominal CT was obtained showing multiple loops of dilated bowel with transition point within the right lower quadrant approximately 10-15 cm upstream from the end-ileostomy.
Decrease in size of multiloculated intra-abdominal fluid collections with interval removal of catheter in the anterior pelvic fluid collection and appropriate position of catheter in the perihepatic fluid collection.
Findings were concerning for early or partial small bowel obstruction.
Upon admission there was minimal stool output or gas in the ostomy bag, however over the course of the next 24 hours, stool output increased significantly, and NGT drainage dropped off.
He was allowed sips of clears, but developed significant abdominal pain.
NG was replaced with immediate drainage of 900 cc of bilious fluid.
NG was then removed, but he had increased abdominal pain with more bloating.
Ostomy output decreased to 200 cc for the day, and the NG tube was replaced.
TTE was done to evaluate fluid status (decreased urine output) as he did not have central access.
He tolerated the procedure without incident, liver biopsy results showed Bile ductular proliferation with associated neutrophils and mild to moderate intrahepatocytic and canalicular cholestasis, there was no evidence of acute rejection.
On [**6-30**], as follow-up to CT done a day earlier, the patient underwent placement of two new drains, which were in response to new areas of fluid concerning for abscess.
He underwent placement of an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] pigtail catheter to the right multilobulated fluid collection, which yielded malodorous altered blood in keeping with an infected hematoma and which Micro isolated E coli and Vanco resistant enterococcus.
The left sided drain was removed on [**7-5**] for very low output.
CT demonstrated smaller right sided abdominal fluid collections.
There was a new fluid collection in the left abdomen which communicated superiorly and inferiorly with additional fluid collections which measured 9.7 x 6.2 x >11.3 cm.The LUQ drain was removed.
This fluid collection appeared to communicate with the more inferiorly located collection extending into the pelvis and a more superiorly located collection inferior and anterior to the pancreatic tail.
Anticoagulation was resumed for h/o splenic vein thrombus.
TPN was started for poor po/kcal intake.
On [**7-11**], CT demonstrated a new LUQ collection.
By [**2152-8-10**] he was intubated had thoracentesis for pleural effusion getting 1300cc out.
He did have mucous plug episode that he was bronched for.
By [**2152-8-19**] he was re-intubated and placed back on pressors.
He developed an increased pressor requirement that same day and was found to have cardiac tamponade and had a pericardial drain placed.
Despite getting the fluid out of his pericardial sac he continued to have increased pressor requirement and poor function on the vent.
