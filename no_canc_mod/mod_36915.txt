She denies chest pain, SOB, or lightheadedness during the episode.
She has a long history of becoming tachycardic during HD; admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] last [**Month (only) **].
She had been discharged yesterday from [**Hospital 882**] hospital after admission for SOB and was found to have pulmonary edema.
She has not noticed any changes in her functional status recently.

Fullness of the hila and mild perihilar opacities may relate to mild fluid overload and/or crowding of vessels.
No definite focal consolidation is seen.
No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with possible mild fluid overload.
EKG [**2124-3-15**]: HR 120, atrial tachycardia, Nl axis, normal interval, nl R wave progression, no ST-changes.
Microbiology: [**2-/2041**] Blood culture (FINAL): NO growth MRSA screen: NO MRSA isolated .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to extensive apical akinesis and severe hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle with the exception of the basal posterior and lateral walls, which are relatively preserved.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-10-7**], there has been marked further deterioration of left ventricular contractile function as well as marked increased in mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
[**3-19**] R FEMORAL ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: Focused vascular ultrasound of the right groin, the common femoral artery and vein was performed with [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale, color Doppler, and spectral analysis.
Findings are concerning for an AV fistula between the right common femoral artery and vein, just proximal to the greater saphenous vein takeoff, where there is turbulent, mixed broad waveform and suggestion of connection between the two vessels.
No evidence of pseudoaneurysm is seen.
No evidence of hematoma is seen in the right groin.
IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for AV fistula between the right common femoral artery and vein.
No evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
Brief Hospital Course: 69F with HX SVT, ESRD, CAD, PAD, and sCHF p/w symptomatic atrial tachycardia to the 130s during outpatient dialysis; admitted for management of this chronic problem, previously refractory to pharmacologic therapy and a 1st ablation attempt on [**2124-3-2**]; during this admission she underwent a 2nd ablation attempt which was not wholly successful (some intermittent Atach episodes thereafter), and which was c/b a post-procedure R femoral AVF.
# ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA Admitted from HD w/atrial tachycardia, a chronic intermittent issues.
Usually asymptomatic; now symptomatic w/lightheadedness at HD.
Admission EKG here documented atrial tachycardia to the 130s, no ischemic changes.
However, she did flip into atrial tachycardia intermittently thereafter, with HR max 120s - episodes self-resolved, occurred primarily during HD, and were asymptomatic.
Patient will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (electrophysiologist) in outpatient follow-up in ~1 week to discuss any possible future intervenion.
In the interim, at home and at HD, her inpatient cardiologist felt comfortable tolerating asymptomatic atrial tachycardia to the 120s-130s.
We note that on [**3-16**], post-procedure recovery was initially complicated by anaesthesia-induced hypotension (requiring overnight ICU obs) and later by the slow development of a R femoral AVF (documented by ultrasound, see results).
# CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE, LVEF 20% TTE during this admission demonstrated LVEF 20%, MR 4+ TR 4+, all worse than prior.
Ischemic vs. tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy suspected as underlying cause.
Imdur was stopped due to relative hypotension (SBP 90s-110s).
# ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION Patient's BP fell to 75/palp when working w/PT on [**3-20**].
She worked with PT twice more and was instructed on techniques to decrease orthostatic symptoms and prevent falls.
# CAD Patient w/ significant 2V CAD (LAD stented w/BMS x2, RCA occluded 100% on [**9-/2123**] cath).
EKGs negative for evidence of restenosis or ischemic changes.
No chest pain or dyspnea.
# CHRONIC ANEMIA Chronic; family confirms that she receives Epo at outpatient HD.
Denies h/o melena or GI bleeding.
# ESRD: Longstanding, on qMWF schedule.
No difficulty w/LUE AV fistula access.
Atrial tachycardia episodes occurred primarily during HD sessions, were asymptomatic and self-resolved within minutes.
# Hx Hypothyroidism s/p thyroidectomy TSH wnl at admission.
# Hx Seizure disorder One seizure in the past per patient.

The procedure was successful - you developed occasional rapid rates but eventually returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will see you in follow-up to discuss whether you might need another ablation procedure if you develop rapid heartrate again.
We noticed that you were lightheaded and had slightly low blood pressures when you first stand up, especially on dialysis days.
You had elevated blood sugars here, to >300 on more than 1 occassion.
You did not want to start diabetes medications.
You should discuss this further with your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] you should be taking medication to control high blood sugar at home.
If you have any questions or concerns please call the office.
