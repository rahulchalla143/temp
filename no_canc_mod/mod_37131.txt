Admission Date:  [**2139-11-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-2-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2083-9-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Found down at nursing home, hypercarbic respiratory failure.
M with h/o HTN, chronic renal disease thought secondary to HTN, schizoaffective DO, bipolar DO, presents from home after having been found down by Baycove workers (psych in home services) this morning.
Initial ABG was 6.98/98/156 and he was intubated at which time BP reportedly dropped to 50s systolic and he was transiently on pressors, until BP quickly returned to that of presentation.
A CXR was performed which showed diffuse bilateral haziness c/w pulmonary edema w/o clear e/o infiltrate.
A head CT was ordered, but they were unable to perform as he became bradycardic requiring atropine.
He is now being transferred to the MICU for further management of his hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypothermia and hypotension.
Past Medical History: -HTN -Renal disease, thought to be [**12-26**] to HTN -Schizoaffective disorder -Bipolar disorder -Morbid obesity -Probable gout, given med list -Chronic LE edema -Dyslipidemia  Social History: Sees social worker [**Name (NI) 57756**] [**Name (NI) **] (Phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 100427**]).
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: ======================== VS: Temp: 87.4->93.2  BP: 144/88 (73-144 systolic) HR: 58-74  AC 600/18 PEEP 5 FiO2 50% GEN: Intubated and sedated, opens eyes and tracks prior to CVL insertion, but does not follow commands, morbidly obese HEENT: [**Last Name (un) **] minimally reactive to light, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, unable to assess jvd [**12-26**] to habitus, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: Clear anteriorly with upper airway sounds CV: RRR, S1 and S2 distant [**12-26**] habitus, no m/r/g appreciated ABD: +b/s, soft, obese, protruberant, does not respond to deep palpation, no palpable masses EXT: 2+ b/l LE edema, left great toe distally with increased redness, warmth, no skin breakdown/purulent drainage SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice NEURO: Neuro exam unable to fully assess given intubated/sedated.
Electrophoresis, Urine  +/- MULTIPLE PROTEIN BANDS SEEN, WITH ALBUMIN PREDOMINATING BASED ON IFE (SEE SEPARATE REPORT), NO MONOCLONAL IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEEN.
NEGATIVE FOR BENCE-[**Doctor Last Name **] PROTEIN INTERPRETED BY [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 19695**], MD  Immunofixation, Urine NO MONOCLONAL IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEEN.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to previous tracing of [**2139-4-27**] multiple abnormalities as noted persist without major change.
Compared to previous tracing no major change.
Allowing for the significantly lower lung volumes, there is further cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion, interstitial and early alveolar edema and probable bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
No definite focal consolidation is seen.
There is prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissues, more evident than on the earlier study (perhaps related to degree of patient rotation), likely representing ectatic brachiocephalic vessels.
Appearance is somewhat nonspecific, but could be consistent with gout or inflammatory arthropathy.
No hemorrhage or mass effect.
Mild stable ventriculomegaly.
EEG [**2139-11-12**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the frequent spike  and sharp wave discharges seen in the frontal regions bilaterally and over the central midline.
While no clear spike/slow wave or sharp/slow wave complexes were noted, the findings raise concern for an area of potential epileptogenesis.
In addition, the background was disorganized, slow, and interrupted by bursts of generalized mixed frequency slowing, consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
This suggests dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the common causes of encephalopathy.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, although encephalopathic patterns can sometimes obscure focal findings.
There were no repetitive or sustained  discharges and no electrographic seizures were noted.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
EEG [**2139-11-13**] IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured two sitter pushbuttons for unclear reasons which were not associated with any significant change on the patient's EEG or any significant change in the patient's appearance on video.
No electrographic seizures were seen; however, interictal epileptiform discharges were seen independently from both hemispheres and from the bifrontal region simultaneously at times, but these never progressed to [**Hospital1 2824**] electrographic seizures.
The background was slow and disorganized throughout the recording suggestive of a moderate to severe encephalopathy.
EEG [**2139-11-14**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling shows a normal background with bursts of generalized slowing and particularly prominent slowing over the right hemisphere.
This suggests a focal subcortical abnormality on the right side.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
EEG [**2139-11-15**] IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal 24 hour video EEG telemetry in the waking and sleeping states due to the bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing.
This is a nonspecific finding suggestive of deep subcortical midline dysfunction.
There were no epileptiform discharges, no lateralized findings, and no electrographic seizures noted.
No fracture or dislocation.
Degenerative changes of the foot.
M with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, HTN, CKD thought [**12-26**] to HTN who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] after having been found down by Baycove Social Work at home and then found to be hypothermic, hypercarbic, and hypotensive in the ED and subsequently admitted to the MICU for further care.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Etiology is not entirely clear.
He is obese and likely has some element of OSA vs. hypoventilation syndrome but the degree seems more extensive to be explained by this alone.
Although serum and urine tox were negative for illicits, there is the possibility of overdose on psychiatric medication.
As he was found down, trauma is another possible cause of his depressed mental status and hypoventilation, although no evidence of this on physical exam.
Head CT was negative for acute process.
On the floor, sleep medicine was consulted to help evaluate the patient for possible OSA and to titrate nighttime BiPAP.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: (Stage IV CKD) Creatinine elevated from previous baseline of high 2-low 3.
No problems with volume status and making good urine.
Renal followed him initially and considered possible FSGS secondary to obesity or hypertension nephrosclerosis.
He had large proteinuria of unknown origin upon admission that continued during his stay.
Hyperkalemia was intermittently a concern; received Kayexalate as needed.
Renal was reconsulted for evaluation of worsening renal status, chronic kidney disease.
He is to follow up with his outpatient nephrologist about possible future hemodialysis.
He was started on phosphate binders and Vitamin D.  # Altered mental status:  As above, the differential was broad, but likely is a reflection of hypercarbia.
Given the degree of hypercarbia and having been found down, likely altered mental status even prior to this possibly secondary to ingestion of higher dose of his own meds vs. psychosis and subsequent fall, although no clear evidence of trauma.
Head CT negative and EEG without seizure activity.
Following this, there were no further problems with somnolence.
# Hypotension: Was normotensive upon presentation to ED (probable relative hypotension for him given h/o poorly controlled HTN), but then required Levophed in ED and upon presentation to MICU.
Met SIRS criteria w/hypothermia and RR >20 and concerning for sepsis although truly no clear source of infection (CXR with clear pulmonary edema, but w/o clear infiltrate however at risk for aspiration given AMS/found down), UA negative.
Cardiac etiology was also a possibility given increased CEs and new pulmonary edema (no EKG changes).
Echo was unchanged without new wall motion abnormalities.
Cortisol stimulation test was not suggestive of adrenal insufficiency.
In the MICU, the patient became hypertensive.
# Elevated cardiac enzymes: CK elevated secondary to rhabdomyolysis; however MB also up with positive MBI (trending down slightly).
Troponin was also up and was likely multifactorial given hypotension and likely demand, also with worsened renal function.
No clear EKG changes c/w ischemia.
TTE without focal wall motion abnormalities.
# Schizoaffective & Bipolar disorder with h/o psychosis: H/o psychosis in the past on multiple occasions.
Does not have capacity to make decisions; therefore, the process of guardianship was pursued.
The patient's legal hearing for guardianship occurred on [**2140-2-23**], and a guardian was appointed.
# Hypertension: BPs stable after resolution of hypotension.
# Left ankle pain: History of gout, elevated uric acid.
Ankle film showed degenerative changes without fracture.
HIT antibody negative.
CKD also contributing to anemia, so epogen was started and then stopped after resolution of his anemia.
# Herpes zoster: The patient was noted to have a herpetic rash on right shoulder, which was culture positive for herpes zoster.
He was treated with valtrex for 5 days with resolution of his symptoms and improvement in the rash.
# Access: poor peripherals, lost IV access after transfer to medicine floor.
Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure 2.
Obstructive Sleep Apnea 3.
Hypertension 4.
Chronic Kidney Disease, Stage IV 5.
This was likely due to a combination of factors, including obstructive sleep apnea, hypoventilation syndrome, and medications.
If you have any of the following symptoms, please call your doctor or go to the nearest ER: fever>101, chest pain, shortness of breath, altered mental status, abdominal pain, or any other concerning symptoms.
