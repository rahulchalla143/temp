Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 64 year old male with morbid obesity, DMII, GERD, hyperlipidemia HTN, and prior [**Month/Day/Year **] dependency p/w dyspnea; he underwent tracheal stent placement on [**5-20**] and was intubated for T-tube placement in the setting of failed stenting and respiratory distress.
1 Dyspnea: This was thought to be a combination of sleep apnea, obesity, COPD, and subglottic stenosis.
T tube placement led to partial resolution of the patient's symptoms.
Revision of the T-tube at the second rigid bronchoscopy led to resolution of the patient's dyspnea.
The patient's oxygen requirement was also decreased.
2 Diastolic dysfunction: This was not an active issue, but the patient was maintained on his lasix, metoprolol, lisinopril .
The patient had no symptoms of an allergic or helminthic etiology.
3 Macrocytic anemia.
