In addition, she sustained a laceration to her right lower leg and received 6 stiches at OSH.
At OSH, pt had CT scan of Left hip which showed a cervical neck fracture of the left proximal femur.
She had a routine pre-op evaluation; however her pre-op EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V4.
She denied chest pain or pressure.
She did have some nausea, vomiting and diaphoresis at the OSH.
The orthopedic team was consulted for management of her hip fracture.
The patient denies any chest pain or pressure currently.
ROS:  She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, or hemoptysis.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Has occasional abdominal pain, alternating diarrhea and constipation but has not had a colonoscopy, occasional blood in stool with straining.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: Pulmonary HTN Tricuspid regurgitation CPD Osteoporosis c/b thoracic spine fracture resulting in chronic mid back pain Hypertension h/o pyelonephritis h/o left hydronephrosis of uncertain eitology h/o pneumonia - required stay in rehab prior to transfer to [**Hospital3 **] s/p appendectomy s/p oophrectomy  Social History: She lives in an [**Hospital3 **] facility at [**Location (un) 582**].
Had been living independently until 3 months ago when she had a pneumonia and required inpatient rehab prior to her transfer to [**Hospital 4382**].
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with no JVD.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed:  --the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease --the LAD had no angiographically apparent disease --the LCX had no angiographically apparent disease --the RCA had a calcified proximal 50% stenosis.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated systemic arterial systolic pressures, with SBP 156 mmHg.
No obstructive CAD 2.
Moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
Small LV cavity.
Dilated RV cavity.
Abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with RV pressure overload.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
No MS. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Severe PA systolic hypertension.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate scoliosis leads to asymmetry of the rib cage.
In both lungs, right more than left, a reticular pattern of opacities is seen in both perihilar regions and in the right upper region.
Without comparison, the nature of these lesions is difficult to determine, they could be the result of fibrotic or a chronic inflammatory process, but could also result from chronic overhydration.
Moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette, slightly enlarged right and left hilus, potentially suggesting pulmonary hypertension.
No evidence of pleural effusions, no acute overhydration.
Bilateral apical thickening.
[**2126-4-13**] Lower extremity doppler U/S Preliminary Report !!
no dvt seen in either lower extremity .
Pulmonary embolus within the right middle lobe segmental artery.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Areas of increased opacity in the right upper lobe may represent infection.
Additional areas of opacity in the right middle lobe may represent infarct or atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) EKG changes - Perioperative EKG prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] showed ST elevations in V3-V4 and to a lesser extent in II,III,F,V5-V6.
Cardiac cath [**4-12**] revealed a right-dominant system with a calcified 50% proximal stenosis in the RCA but no angiographically apparent disease in the LMCA, LAD, and LCX.
TTE [**2126-4-12**] revealed normal left atrial size with an estimated right atrial pressure 10-20mmHg, normal left ventricular wall thickness and a small left ventricular cavity, normal left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 70%), hypertrophied right ventricular free wall, dilated right ventricular cavity with borderline normal free wall function, abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload, moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets with a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis, mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets, left ventricular inflow pattern suggesting impaired relaxation, mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets with moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation, and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Cardiac enzymes were trended with no elevation in her CK's threfore this was felt not to be cardiac ischemia.
2) Pulmonary Embolus - On hospital day 2, the patient had low-grade fever, tachycardia, worsening hypoxemia with resting oxygen saturation in the mid 90's on 6 L NC, new T-wave inversions in V3 and deeper T-wave inversions in V4.
CTA of the chest revealed right middle lobe segmental pulmonary emboli, right middle lobe pulmonary infarct vs. atelectasis, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and volume overload.
Lower extremity doppler ultrasound was negative for DVT.
3) Left femoral neck fracture - Seen in consultation by orthopaedic surgery who recommended proceeding with ORIF.
