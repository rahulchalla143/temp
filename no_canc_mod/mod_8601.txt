Admission Date:  [**2176-2-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-2-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-9-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Drug Allergy Information on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1. endotracheal intubation 2. central venous catheter placement  History of Present Illness: 74 y/o M w/past hx of HTN and cervical radiculopathy, who presented today c/o weakness.
He denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain.
Mild nausea but no vomiting.
While examining him, he became bradycardic to 42 and hypotensive to 60/40.
He received 2L NS wide open with a mild response in his bp to 70s/50s.
Bedside echo revealed no pericardial effusion, possibly depressed EF, no visible aortic aneurysm, and a dilated IVC.
He was taken urgently to CT scan to r/o PE and dissection.
no aspiration observed and CXR no infiltrate.
No blood in vomit.
He then became tachycardic to the 130s (narrow complex) which appeared to be SVT per ED resident no ECG confirmation in CT. Dopamine stopped with normalization of HR.
He then again became tachycardic in the 130s, and this time broke with carotid massage back down to 70.
CT showed no PE or dissection.
When he returned, intubated for airway protection given vomiting and hemodynamic instability.
CXR showed no pneumo/hemothorax.
Subsequently became hypotensive again, and placed back on neo and dopa.
Recently had epidural steroid inject ion [**2-23**].
No worsening of back pain since that time.
HTN 2.
Low back pain s/p lumbar epidural steroid injection [**1-8**]  Social History: never smoked, no alcohol.
skin: no rash or skin breakdown anteriorly   Pertinent Results: Laboratory: labs at discharge: wbc 4.7, hct 41.2, plt 148 Na 134, K 3.6, Cl 110, HCO3 22, BUN 11, Cr 0.8, glucose 95, Ca 8.6, Mg 1.8, Ph 2.9. .
No evidence for pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
Focal mesenteric region of increased attenuation which most likely represents inflammation secondary to mesenteric panniculitis, or less likely trauma, edema, or tumor (lymphoma).
There is no evidence of mesenteric vasculature or bowel compromise.
Multiple low-attenuation lesions throughout the liver which most likely represent simple liver cysts; however, an ultrasound examination could be performed for confirmation when the patient is clinically stabilized.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 M with fever and hypotension intubated electively for airway protection.
This was thought most likely to be due to hypovolemia due to dehydration as his blood pressure normalized with IV fluids.
By the end of his hospitalization he had actually started to become hypertensive and was started on lisinopril 10 mg daily.
Fever: This was of unclear etiology and was attributed to a likely viral syndrome.
He had no localizing signs or symptoms of infection.
A test for influenza was negative as was a urine culture.
# Hyponatremia: On admission he was initially hyponatremic with a sodium of 129.
This was thought to be due to a combination of hypovolemia from dehydration as well as HCTX effect.
# Cervical radiculopathy: He has a history of this and was last seen in neurology clinic in [**2169**].
He intermittently complained of neck pain during his admission and was set up with a follow-up appointment in neurology with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**4-8**] at 3:00. .
# Lower back pain: He has a history of chronic lower back pain and spinal stenosis and has been followed in the pain management center.
He was kept on his gabapentin and has a follow-up appointment with the pain clinic.
# Urinary hesitancy: This is also a chronic issue for him and he was started on tamsulosin during his hospitalization with some effect.
# Focal mesenteric thickening on CT scan: His abdominal exam was benign and he did not complain of abdominal pain.
He was also set up for appointments with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pain clinic, urology, and neurology.
Viral syndrome.
