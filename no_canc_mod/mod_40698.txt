At rehab facility pt became increasing somnolent and deteriorated to the point of only being responsive to painful stimuli.
She was taken to ED where she was found to be confused and bradycardic.
Neurology consulted; no focal deficits seen on exam but EEG revealed status epilepticus with R temporal predominance.
Pt has also received vanocmycin, cefepime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin for UTI and question of pneumonia.
Past Medical History: 1) Chronic atrial fibrillation on digoxin and coumadin 2) Diastolic CHF, EF 55% 3) Mild pulm HTN (seen on echo) 4) Chronic renal insufficiency (baseline cr 1.5-3) 5) Diverticulosis 6) ASD, L to R shunt 7) Diverticulosis 8) AAA (3 cm) 9) Chronic dyspnea on exertion 10) Macular degeneration   Social History: Russian.

Ext: No edema Neurol: Toes mute, some spontaneous movement of lower extremities.
Could not elicit reflexes, no clonus Skin: No rash.
MRI and CT from OSH no stroke or bleed .
No evidence of acute infarction.
Chronic infarcts and small vessel ischemic change.
MRA of the brain within normal limits allowing for flow artifact as described above.
[**8-8**], [**8-9**] EEG This 24 hour EEG telemetry initially was notable for a burst suppression pattern, followed by intermittent predominantly bitemporal epileptiform discharges and slowing within these same regions.
At times, the epileptiform discharges acquire a more rhythmic quality, concerning for an electrographic seizure.
The background reaches a 10 Hz alpha rhythm but is remarkable for a generalized delta theta slowing.
These findings are suggestive of an epileptogenic focus in the posterior temporal region, perhaps more so on the right.
Prolonged runs of more rhythmic appearing generalized discharges are concerning for limited electrographic seizures early in the course of the telemetry.

[**2190-8-26**] 06:03PM STOOL CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN B ASSAY- detected  Brief Hospital Course: This 84 year old woman with atrial fib, CHF, HTN in non-convulsive status epilepticus also with recent digoxin toxicity and UTI presented to this hospital for management of her status epilepticus.
On presentation, the patient was intubated (was in hypoxic, hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to apnea at OSH) and obtunded.
A lumbar puncture performed on transfer was unremarkable with no evidence of infection, all culture data was negative.
MRI/MRA brain was not remarkable for stroke or bleed.
Her atrial fibrillation was managed with diltiazem or BB if her blood pressured allowed.
Her warfarin was discontinued since the patient had a decreased hematocrit.
She suffered from a GI bleed and RP bleed.
She also had a progressive leukocytosis up to 50.000.
No definitive source for an infection was found until a colonoscopy revealed findings consistent with C. diff colitis (vs ischemic colitis).
With regards to the Digoxin toxicity, this drug was held throughout her hospital stay and her acute renal failure was treated with IVF.
