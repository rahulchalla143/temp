Radiology: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2131-10-10**] 7:21 PM FINDINGS: There is a large right frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with minimal interval change from prior exam.
There is marked subfalcine herniation with leftward shift of midline structures, approximating 2.6 cm, previously 2.4 cm.
There is significant mass effect on the right lateral ventricle with complete effacement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Again noted is transcortical hemorrhagic extension from the right frontal hematoma with a combination of right frontal subdural and subarachnoid hematoma.
A small amount of intraventricular blood is seen layering in the occipital horns, a new finding from prior exam.
New left parafalcine subarachnoid hemorrhage is seen along the cerebral vertex.
There is blood in the interpeduncular cistern.
There is left frontal lobe encephalomalacia as seen on prior CT from [**2131-9-27**].
The bony calvarium appears intact aside from surgical change in the left frontal lobe.
IMPRESSION: Large right frontal parenchymal hematoma with transcortical extension and associated right frontal extra-axial hematoma.
Significant subfalcine herniation with leftward shift.
New areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left cerebral vertex, new intraventricular hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old right-handed man with history of previous ICH felt secondary to amyloid, hypertension, and colon cancer s.p colectomy and elected not to have chemotheraoy who presented as a transfer from an OSH with new IPH and ASDH.
EMS were called and patient was transferred to an OSH where he was noted to have severe hypertension with BP 210/100s.
Head CT demonstrated a R frontal SDH  with 2.4cm midline shift and right frontal IPH.
Repeat CT at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed a large right frontal parenchymal hematoma with transcortical extension and associated right frontal extra-axial hematoma with significant subfalcine herniation with increased 2.6cm midline shift and new areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left cerebral vertex with intraventricular extension.
