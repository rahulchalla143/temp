Admission Date:  [**2129-3-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-3-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ivp Dye, Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 83M with hx progressive lung disease (seen at [**Hospital **] hospital by pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **]) and acute worsening of dyspnea starting 2 days ago.
He reports just a dry cough, no fevers, chills, no orthopnea, some slight LLE swelling, but no weight gain.
At [**Location (un) **] he was noted to have bilateral lower lobe opacities on CXR, and a possible LL infiltrate.
He had no EKG changes, but he did have an elevated Trop I at 0.88 and a BNP of 1,000.
He had been in his usual state of health until about 4 weeks ago when he became very short of breath, and was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital for hypoxia.
While there he was noted to have positive cardiac enzymes, and there was concern for ACS, however he was told he was a poor catheterization candidate due to his poor kidney function (Cr 1.7).
He also had a chest CT which per his family's report was concerning for possible emphysema or intrinsic lung disease.
At [**Hospital1 **] ED he was in mod resp distress satting 92% on NRB, was given an extra 40 mg IV lasix, with 400 cc uop, and his symptoms are slightly improved.
His CXR here again shows bilateral lower lobe patchy infiltrates and some slight suggestion of CHF.
Here he has no EKG changes, Trop T 0.35.
CAD MI [**2104**], CABG '[**14**], per report had a positive pMIBI at [**Location (un) **] during last admission, felt to be poor cath candidate, will need old Echo to get EF - EF 55-60%, mod ischem ant wall/apex, mild ischem lat wall, fixed defect of inf wall c/w old MI.
PVD: no prior interventions per his report, h/o bilateral carotid stenosis, 90% on R and 60% on L 4.

Congestive heart failure.
Left effusion with related opacity, most likely atelectasis.
Pneumonia cannot be excluded however in the presence of infectious symptoms.
Congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions, superimposed on severe emphysema.
If clinically indicated, reevaluation for interstitial lung disease may be performed after treatment.
Numerous mediastinal lymph nodes, which may be reactive in the setting of congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery atherosclerosis.
CXR AP [**3-21**]: Mild pulmonary edema has improved substantially, small bilateral pleural effusions remain.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include basal to mid anteroseptal hypokinesis and basal to mid inferoseptal and inferior hypokinesis/akinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 83yo M with ?severe emphysema presented to OSH w/ acute CHF likely due to cardiac ischemia.
1. hypoxemia: This was likely due to underlying intrinsic lung disease, as well as development of decompensated CHF from recent ischemia.
CT chest w/o contrast also revealed CHF w/ bilateral effusions and evidence of severe emphysema.
Planned to obtain PFT reports from [**Location (un) **], but requested PFTs with lung volumes and DLCO here as outpatient, as well.
He had positive MIBI at OSH but deferred further intervention at that time due to CRI.
Urine and blood cultures were both negative, and he had no evidence of pulmonary infection.
CHF: He had been transferred from [**Location (un) **] to our ICU with elevated troponin - NSTEMI w/ flash pulmonary edema.
Acute occurence of symptoms was c/w decompensated CHF, which improved after nitro and lasix.
PPX: He was given heparin sc and PPI for prophylaxis.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Home Health Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Troponin T elevation to 0.35 CHF COPD CRI - baseline 1.8 - 1.9 .
Secondary: CAD MI [**2104**], CABG '[**14**] PVD HTN IDDM squamous cell carcinoma on the R lateral nodes s/p labyrinthectomy, with RS total deafness   Discharge Condition: improved but still requiring O2 for ambulation   Discharge Instructions: Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65923**] or go to the ED if you have acute shortness of breath, requiring more oxygen, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, sweating, weight gain, leg swelling, dizziness, weakness or fainting.
Please take 20mg daily - eating bananas could help prevent potassium levels from getting too low - metoprolol: changed from labetalol - tamulosin: changed from Hytrin for urinary retention - pantoprazole: you may take this or prilosec - they are interchangeable but pantoprazole may be less expensive - Stop taking Norvasc for now.
