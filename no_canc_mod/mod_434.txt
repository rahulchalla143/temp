Neurologic examination: Mental status: alert and oriented , attentive, Follows  midline and appendicular  commands .No right left confusion, No apraxia or hemineglect.
Visual fields showed left sided hemifield cut obeying the midline, Fundi normal III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact bilaterally no nystagmus V1-3: Sensation intact V1-V3 to touch and pain VII: Facial movement showed mild left sided UMN facial droop VIII: Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally.
No extinction to DSS  Reflexes: +2 and symmetric throughout.
Toes mute  bilaterally  Coordination: finger-nose-finger shows dysmetria on the right side , RAMs clumsy on the right side, he has overshoot on the right side.
Imaging: [**2164-3-22**]   ECHO: No ASD or PFO identified with the injection of intravenous saline contrast at rest or with manuevers.
No intracardiac vegetations.
Left atrial and right atrial spontaneous echo contrast but no left atrial appendage, left atrial, right atrial appendage, or right atrial thrombus identified.
No evidence of simple or complex aortic atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Right basilar heterogeneous opacities are likely linear atelectasis.
Prominent right and left main pulmonary arteries.
Mild cardiomegaly.
Acute infarction in the right occipital lobe and right cerebellum.
Scattered round foci of susceptibility artifacts in the right cerebral sulci, possibly representing deoxygenated blood due to oxygen extraction from ischemia and less likely for microhemorrhages.
[**2164-3-19**]   CHEST (PA & LAT): Limited exam with subtle opacities in the lower lungs which may represent atelectasis versus early pneumonia.
Right cerebellar hemisphere and right occipital lobe infarct, with increased MTT in these regions and likely right superior cerebellar artery occlusion on CTA.
No corresponding cerebral volume abnormalities are seen, compatible with reversible ischemia.
No evidence of hemorrhagic conversion.
Mild bilateral soft and calcific atherosclerotic plaques, slightly worse on the right.
Mild ostial narrowing at the left vertebral artery takeoff.
Right cerebellar hemisphere and right occipital lobe infarct, with increased MTT in these regions and likely right superior cerebellar artery occlusion on CTA.
No corresponding cerebral volume abnormalities are seen, compatible with reversible ischemia.
No evidence of hemorrhagic conversion.
Mild bilateral soft and calcific atherosclerotic plaques, slightly worse on the right.
Mild ostial narrowing at the left vertebral artery takeoff.
[**2164-3-19**]   ECG: Sinus bradycardia with atrial premature beat.
Left atrial abnormality.
Delayed R wave progression is non-diagnostic but cannot exclude possible septal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Diffuse T wave abnormalities.
Cannot exclude myocardial ischemia.
Since the previous tracing of same date there is no significant change.
[**2164-3-19**]   ECG: Sinus bradycardia with atrial premature beat.
Intra-atrial conduction delay.
Delayed R wave progression is non-diagnostic but cannot exclude possible prior septal myocardial infarction.
Diffuse T wave abnormalities.
Cannot exclude myocardial ischemia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Brief Hospital Course:  68 RHM with HTN presented with acute onset vertigo.
CTA does show possible occlusion of right SCA.
Neurologic: Neurologic examination showed left visual field cut, left facial droop and right UE ataxia; exam remained stable throughout admission.
CTA revealed proximal and distal right cervical internal carotid artery 4 mm in diameter.
BP goal was 110-170/90, achieved with home meds; lisinopril briefly held during admission due to renal insufficiency.
Pt initially placed on heparin gtt and transitioned to Lovenox/coumadin as TEE revealed eft atrial and right atrial spontaneous echo contrast.
Gastrointestinal / Abdomen: New onset hematemesis at time of presentation.
UGIE with some small, non-bleeding gastric erosions, no evidence of acute source of bleeding.
Pt's hematocrit remained stable without further episodes of hematemesis during admission.
Pt was placed on PPI gtt while on heparin gtt, transitioned to H2B indefinitely per GI consult to prevent further gastric erosions.
Cardiovascular: Initial EKG in ED revealed pre-mature atrial contractions.
Repeat EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, no episodes of arrhythmia noted throughout admission.
Goal SBP < 160 achieved with adjustment of home antihypertensives (nifedipine CR 180mg qd, atenolol 50 qd); lisinopril 40 qd held briefly due to elevated Cr.
TEE revealed no ASD or PFO identified with the injection of intravenous saline contrast at rest or with manuevers.
No intracardiac vegetations.
Left atrial and right atrial spontaneous echo contrast but no left atrial appendage, left atrial, right atrial appendage, or right atrial thrombus identified.
No evidence of simple or complex aortic atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Renal: Low UOP during admission with elevated creatinine, FENA 0.3%.
Pt will need close monitoring of renal function as he has had elevated creatinine; urine lytes during admission revealed pre-renal azotemia (FeNa 0.3%).
Have started pt back on home ACEi and also started HCTZ for optimal blood pressure control.
CXR with questionable aspiration pneumonia vs atelectasis.
Pulmonary: Possible aspiratrion PNA as above.
No further episodes of hemetemasis after admission to neuromed floor.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: right superior cerebellar artery stroke   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 2572**],  You were admitted for a right superior cerebellar artery stroke.
You had a cardiac echocardiogram which demonstrated no clear cardioembolic source.
-START famotidine 20mg by mouth twice a day to prevent bleeding from your stomach -START Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid and metronidazole by mouth for a total of 10 days for your lung infection  It was a pleasure taking care of you.
