She was then changed to pressure control secondary to high airway pressures and a rapid respiratory rate which she appeared to tolerate more.
This was complicated by a tracheotomy which was too big for her and was preferentially ventilating the left lung, having carbon dioxide retention.
With a dressing placed externally the tracheotomy was in improved position, however, there was a persistent cuff leak around the tracheotomy.
Secondary to the patient's severe interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, she remained on a good deal of ventilatory support.
NEUROLOGIC / VASCULAR:  The patient had developed a left arteriovenous fistula in [**Month (only) 404**] as a complication of a left IJ procedure.
There was no complication to this procedure.
The patient did not acutely wake up after the procedure secondary to anesthesia.
A STAT MRI was obtained and showed no new abnormality.
In addition, it had been determined that the patient had a significant amount of left carotid stenosis (90%).
FEVERS / INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient continued to have intermittent fevers and a low grade leukocytosis during this entire period of her hospital course.
However, after the patient's coiling procedure, it was decided that as the patient was persistently febrile with a persistent leukocytosis and her vent settings were not changed and it did not appear that she had a new pneumonia, it was decided that these Gram negative rods were colonizer and would not be treated.
The patient did continue to grow these Gram negative rods in her sputum after the antibiotics were discontinued.
All antibiotics were discontinued after her tracheotomy procedure on [**3-21**]; no further antibiotics were used to treat the slight intermittent low grade temperatures.
An abdominal CT scan was obtained to rule out an intra-abdominal process; this was negative.
The Infectious Disease Service recommended getting imaging of her right hip where she had had a recent open reduction and internal fixation but secondary to the hardware, an MRI was not going to be useful.
She had no seizure activity.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient was continued on her Synthroid for her hypothyroidism and her insulin and Glargine for diabetes mellitus.
ANEMIA:  The patient has anemia of chronic disease and her hematocrit slowly dropped.
She was continued on subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and will need Physical Therapy in the future.
PERSISTENT TACHYCARDIA / WITHDRAWAL:  The patient is narcotic dependent and was also on Ativan.
The patient was persistently tachycardic during this hospital period to the 130s and 140s and this would worsen with agitation.
This was thought to be secondary to fevers and also to withdrawal as the patient's heart rate would improve with Dilaudid.
In addition, the patient was ruled out for any cardiac ischemia several times.
