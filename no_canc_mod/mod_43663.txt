Mild rightward of midline structure, including left subfalcine herniation, is similar to the prior study.
There is no depressed skull fracture.
IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of left frontal lobar hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and left subfalcine herniation.
Consider MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e for underlying lesion that might include tumor, amyloid angiopathy, or vascular malformation.
CTA: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: A left frontal lobar hematoma, with surrounding edema, is unchanged since the [**2165-5-13**] CT examination.
There is extension of blood into the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, stable, with dependent blood layering in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
There is no blood in the anterior interhemispheric fissure or suprasellar cistern.
No new focus of hemorrhage is identified.
There is continued mild left subfalcine herniation, unchanged.
A small osteoma is present within the right frontal sinus (3:111).
CTA: This examination is somewhat limited due to motion-related artifact.
No large aneurysm or AVM is detected.
The cavernous and supraclinoid portions of the ICA are calcified bilaterally, without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenoses.
No significant stenosis is seen within the carotid, vertebral, basilar and arterial branches.
Stable left frontal lobar hematoma, with intraventricular extension and mild left subfalcine herniation.
No evidence of an AVM.
No large aneurysm is seen, although evaluation is limited due to significant motion-related artifacts.
The lack of blood within the suprasellar cistern or the anterior interhemispheric fissure decreases the likelihood of a ruptured aneurysm from the anterior vasculature.
MRI should be considered to evaluate for amyloid angiopathy, cavernous malformation, or underlying mass.
If there remains a clinical concern for a small aneurysm, a MRA can also be considered.
CT [**2165-5-15**]:  A left frontal intraparenchymal hematoma is redemonstrated, with a neighboring region of edema, measuring approximately 6.2 x 3.8 cm.
Mild neighboring mass effect includes sulcal effacement within the left frontal lobe.
There is trace hemorrhagic extension into the body of the left lateral ventricle (2:19), and the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles (2:15).
There is also a 4 mm rightward shift of midline structures (2:20).
A new trace amount of hyperdense blood is seen within the right temporal lobe with a possible component of subarachnoid hemorrhage (2:15).
There is no new mass effect or large vascular territorial infarction.
No change in left frontal lobe hematoma, with trace intraventricular extension.
There is no new mass effect.
New trace blood within the right temporal lobe with a possible component of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left atrial volume is severely increased.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis and inferolateral hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
Mild aortic stenosis.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
He was transfered from outside hospital after he presented there for evaluation of confusion and found to have IPH.
He was closely monitered for signs of raised ICP secondary to bleed and possible associated edema.
He was monitered for clinical evidence of seizures.
Repeat CT scans were done for monitering of progression of bleed or for monitering for signs of edema, which did not show any evidence of either.
MRI was done for more evaluation which showed possilbe small embolic strokes however there was no clinical evidence or any embolic source identified.
Cards He was closely monitered on telemetry which did not show any evidence of arrhythmia.
Pulm Chest X ray was obtained which did not show any evidence of acute process.
Gen care he was put on bowel regime, pneumboots for DVT prophylaxis.
He was tranferred to the floor:  On the floor the patient continued to do well  His issues were as follows:  Hyponatremia: The patient developed a mild hyponatremia.
His urine lytes were noted to have an elevated sodium and were consistent with SIADH.
The patient has had no clinical signs of fluid retention.
There was no evidence of embolic source for any possible infarct.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
CN: no deficits Motor: full strength at UE/LE [**Last Name (un) **]: decreased vibration/pinprick at feet bilaterally Gait: stooped, broad based, steady.
We obtained an MRI which did not show any evidence of underlying masses but there was a concern of small strokes.
To further evaluate this we obtained an echocardiogram of your heart which showed a depressed LV function (EF = 35%) but no evidence of thrombus.
You were also noted to have a low sodium and it was thought to be a syndrome called SIADH which can happen with brain bleeds.
If you have any of the symptoms listed below please call your doctor or return to the nearest emergency room.
