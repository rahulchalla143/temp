Admission Date:  [**2156-6-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2156-6-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-9-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 63 year old male with h/o severe COPD who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 2177**] after a prolonged admission for hypercapneic respiratory failure from COPD complicated by pneumothorax and bleb rupture.
He is being transferred for consideration of intrabronchial valve.
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] [**2156-5-19**] with hypercapneic respiratory failure felt to be due to COPD.
He has known COPD and was reportedly not compliant with his medications and still smoking.
He presented with productive cough and dyspnea.
CXR showed left basilar PTX and urgent chest tube was placed by CT surgery.
CT chest showed large bulla in [**1-12**] of RLL of lung.
A SC incision into the left chest wall ("blow hole") was done by CT surgery which resulted in slow improvement in his SC emphysema.
He had persistent air leak and small left sided PTX was seen on daily films.
He continued to have persistent air leaks and 2nd chest tube was placed on [**6-10**].
During his course at [**Hospital1 2177**], he completed a course of steroids and azithromycin for COPD exacerbation.
On [**6-15**], he desatted to the 80's requiring non-rebreather with resolution of his symptoms.
CXR showed RLL infiltrate and he was started on vanco/cefepime for HCAP, although f/u xray showed chronic changes and antibiotics were stopped.
He also developed diffuse abdominal pain on [**5-10**] with emesis.
Currently, he reports pain at the site of his chest tubes and pain in his epigastrium.
Denies current nausea or vomiting.
Past Medical History: Severe COPD, not on home O2 as still smoking Malnutrition/FTT Chronic hyponatremia H/o PTX in setting of PNA many years ago EtOH abuse, remote Possible h/o cirrhosis per patient Gastric ulcer H/o cleft palate surgery in youth with subsequent difficulty speaking   Social History: Lived in [**Location 686**] in senior housing by himself prior to hospitalization.
Smokes 1ppd, history of alcohol abuse but quit [**2137**], no IVDU.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS: Diminished breath sounds throughout L>R with coarse expiratory wheezing.
ABDOMEN: Diminished bowel sounds but present, soft and only mildly tender to palpation over epigastrium, not distended or tympanic.
No HSM palpable.
Has diffuse subcutaneous emphysema across abdomen EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
At the right apex, there are severe emphysematous and bullous parenchymal alterations.
Identical lesions are seen in the lateral aspects of the left lung and at the bases of the right lung.
At the bases of the right lung, a small pleural effusion is visible.
The presence of a small basal pneumothorax cannot be excluded with certainty.
There are extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities in the middle and lower lung zones.
The multiple air bronchograms with irregular border suggest that these changes have a chronic component.
Thin 2.5 mm subdural hematoma at the right frontal lobe without evidence of fracture or mass effect.
Left sphenoid bone lytic lesion.
DDx includes hemangioma, fibrous dysplasia, but also metastasis or chondrosarcoma.
Small amount of fluid in the left mastoid air cells.
-Right shoulder plain film ([**2156-6-19**]): There are no signs for acute fractures or dislocations.
There are mild degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint.
-Pelvis ([**2156-6-19**]): Single view of the pelvis demonstrates no displaced fractures or dislocations.
There are degenerative changes of the right hip with spurring in the superolateral acetabula.
There are mild degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.
#Bullous Emphysema- The patient has long standing COPD, not on home o2, as he continued to smoke and it has been complicated by bleb rupture with pneumothoraces.
On admission to the outside hospital he was in hypercarbic respiratory distress and required intubation (temporarily reversed his DNI status at that time).
He completed a course of antibiotics for COPD exacerbation at the OSH.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation by interventional pulmonary.
He acutely became tachypneic, dyspneic and complaining of not being able to breath and was transferred to the ICU.
His CXR showed bullae in the left and right lung.
Ultimately, IP felt there was no intervention that would be of benefit to the patient.
He complained of multiple episodes of air hunger and was treated with escalating doses of morphine.
On admission to the ICU here, he expressed his wishes to be DNR/DNI and that he did not wish to have any further interventions and was looking for hospice.
#Small bowel obstruction- The patient had a known SBO at the OSH and had refused NG tube placement there as well as on admission here.
There was audible air that came out of the NG tube on placement.
The patient pulled the NGT on HD3 while he was delirious and it was not replaced.
#Fall abd subdural hemorrhage- Early on HD4, the patient tried to leave his room while he was delirious and had a fall with head strike.
Her reported right shoulder and arm pain after the fall, no fracture on right shoulder plain film and no fracture on pelvic fx.
Head CT showed a 2.5mm frontal subdural hematoma.
He did not have any major apparent neurological sequelae of this subdural (pupils remained reactive and equal, moving all extremities) and no repeat imaging was obtained after his GOC were changed to [**Date Range 3225**].
