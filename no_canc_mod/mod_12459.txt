Admission Date:  [**2108-8-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2108-9-10**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, vascular disease, increased cholesterol, laryngeal carcinoma 10 years ago, status post laryngectomy, cervical carcinoma status post TAH, angina and appendectomy, who presented to [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Room on [**2108-8-4**].
This whole issue started on [**2108-7-20**] when patient presented to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital for an ischemic right fifth toe.
When she got to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital she was anemic with hematocrit of 24 and thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 25,000.
She received two units of packed red blood cells and 6 units of platelets and she continued to have low counts.
On [**8-4**] she complained of left hand numbness, paresthesias and a left sided facial droop that lasted 15 minutes, which resolved on its own.
Neuro consult felt TIA was the most likely cause with right MCA territory.
MRI and MRA demonstrated atherosclerotic changes of intracranial carotids, right greater than left, but no stroke.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 32495**] began plasmapheresis on [**8-5**], though during her first episode she developed hypotension with systolic blood pressure to the 80's, responded to fluid boluses and she was also hypocalcemic at the time.
Therefore, patient was transmitted to the MICU where plasmapheresis continued there.
She needed plasmapheresis again on [**8-12**] for decreasing platelets, increasing LDH and decreasing haptoglobin.
Subsequently on [**8-12**] she developed a fever to 101.
She had a line exchange on [**8-17**].
During that time her platelet count was decreasing and there was a question of infection vs DIC and HIT.
Plasmapheresis continued through the right subclavian catheter placed by IR with completion of plasmapheresis on the [**9-6**].
Cardiovascular showed a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema but there was a large ecchymoses in the right groin area.
Back without tenderness.
She has hypertension, vascular disease, increased cholesterol, laryngeal carcinoma 10 years ago, status post laryngectomy, cervical cancer status post total abdominal hysterectomy, angina status post epi.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Head CT on [**8-4**] showed no acute blood.
The patient developed a plasmapheresis on [**8-5**] at which point she became hypotensive with systolic blood pressure to the 80's and hypocalcemia.
The patient restarted plasmapheresis on [**8-12**].
When patient had a fever on [**8-12**] and the line needed exchanging, the patient was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on the [**Hospital Ward Name 8559**].
During that time there was question of infection and DIC vs HIT.
The patient had HIT positive lab test results.
Some time on the floor the patient had one episode of chest tightness that resolved with Nitroglycerin.
Cardiology consult believed this to be demand ischemia with minor ST-T changes.
The patient completed plasmapheresis on [**9-6**] for a total of 25 sessions of plasmapheresis.
