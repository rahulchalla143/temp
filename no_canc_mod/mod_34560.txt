Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 59 yo F with tracheobronchomalacia s/p recent thoracic tracheo- and broncho-plasty with right upper lobe wedge resection admitted on [**2180-11-22**] with severe dyspnea, found to have large bilateral PE's and evidence of right heart strain.
The patient underwent right thoracotomy with thoracic tracheo- and broncho-plasty with right upper lobe wedge resection on [**2180-10-4**].
One week prior to re-admission she developed some fevers, shortness of breath and nausea.
The patient presented from rehab on [**2180-11-23**] with acute severe dyspnea and was found to have bilateral sub-massive PE's with bilateral lower extremity DVT's and signs of right heart strain on EKG and echo.
She received systemic anticoagulation with marked improvement in her symptomatic dyspnea and oxygen requirement back to her baseline home oxygen supplementation by nasal cannula.
At the time of discharge the patient was therapeutic on warfarin with 24 hours of overlap with therapeutic heparin.
- Hypercoaguable work-up and duration of anticoagulation.
- Elective outpatient TTE in the future to evaluate for signs of resolution of right heart strain.
The patient did have a small amount of hematuria with a single episode of clot passage in the urine and a nosebleed while on dual therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin.
She was counselled to discuss any ongoing hematuria with her PCP and to consider outpatient referral to urology if necessary.
No visible blood was seen on urination on the day of discharge.
Of note the patient had some lower extremity edema and a positive fluid balance while in the hospital and her home lasix had been held during her hospitalization.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Sub-massive pulmonary embolism - Bilateral DVT's.
Secondary: - Tracheobronchomalacia s/p tracheobronchoplasty and wedge resection of the right upper lung lobe - COPD - OSA  Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with severe shortness of breath.
You must take a blood thinning medication called coumadin to prevent recurrence or enlargement of the blood clots for at least the next 6 months and potentially longer.
Please discuss a work-up for the cause of your clot formation with your doctor.
Please discuss scheduling a repeat echocardiogram in the future for further evaluation of your heart function after this recent injury.
You did have a small amount of blood in the urine after starting your blood thinning medication.
Call your doctor or return to the hospital for any new or worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, significant blood clots in the urine or difficulty making urine or any other concerning findings.
