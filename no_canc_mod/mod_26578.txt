He reportedly had been having difficulty breathing for 3-4 weeks and was admitted to [**Hospital 31429**] Hospital in NH earlier on [**2124-4-10**] where he was treated for a COPD exacerbation.
However, his shortness of breath persisted with cough and vomiting, so he presented to our ED.
He has sharp pain/pressure with deep inspiration typical of prior COPD exacerbations or pneumonias.
His breath sounds were tight sounding with diffuse expiratory wheezes.
Labs showed a WBC of 16.7 with 92%N but no bands.

CXR showed low lung volumes and bibasilar R>L atelectasis with RML atelectasis/partial collapse.
He was to be admitted to the floor, but given persistent tachycardia despite 2L NS, he was admitted instead to the MICU.
He c/o persistent cough and difficulty breathing.
He believes he has had decreased urine output with sensation of urinary retention.
He has not been eating or drinking well.
Also, chronic pain in "every bone, everywhere."

There are low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.

Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.
Bibasilar, right greater than left atelectasis with increase in likely right middle lobe atelectasis/partial collapse.
[**2124-4-14**]: Renal Ultrasound with dopplers FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.0 cm and the left kidney measures 12.7 cm.
There is no hydronephrosis.
No stone or cyst or solid mass is seen in either kidney.
DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave images were obtained.
Note is made that this is a limited Doppler examination due to the patient's inability to hold his breath.
Arterial waveforms demonstrating sharp upstrokes are seen in the main renal artery of each kidney.
No hydronephrosis and no renal mass or stone identified.
Limited Doppler examination with no indication of a renal artery stenosis.
[**2124-4-24**] PA&Lat CXR: IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion to suggest fluid overload.
No focal consolidation.
Bibasilar linear atelectasis.
Discharge lab results: [**2124-4-26**] 05:40AM BLOOD WBC-13.8* RBC-4.92 Hgb-12.5* Hct-40.6 MCV-83 MCH-25.5* MCHC-30.9* RDW-18.8* Plt Ct-219 [**2124-4-26**] 05:40AM BLOOD Plt Ct-219 [**2124-4-26**] 05:40AM BLOOD Glucose-333* UreaN-35* Creat-0.6 Na-132* K-4.8 Cl-92* HCO3-28 AnGap-17  Brief Hospital Course: 49 year-old man with h/o severe COPD, dCHF, CAD, h/o noncompliance, p/w persistent dyspnea/hypoxia after signing out AMA from OSH where undergoing COPD treatment and found to have persistent renal failure.
# Hypoxia/dyspnea: His presentation was most consistent with a COPD exacerbation; he was congested sounding but unable to bring up secretions.
He has a history of dCHF but appeared more intravascularly dry on exam.
He had no fevers or consolidations to suggest pneumonia; his leukocytosis was likely due to the steroids started at the OSH.
PE was possible given his tachycardia, but the patient is at low risk by Wells' Criteria.
We also considered cardiac ischemia given his history of CAD, but he had no chest pain or ischemic EKG changes and cardiac enzymes were negative.
He had no arrhythmia on telemetry other than sinus tachycardia.
When his symptoms did not improve, he was increased to Solumedrol 80mg IV Q8hrs briefly.
# Sinus tachycardia: Improved but did not fully resolve.
Pt tachyardic and tachypneic but afebrile; his clinical picture was not consistent with SIRS/sepsis as also explainable by COPD.
Substance withdrawal a possibility; he denied EtOH use but concern for oxycodone overuse at OSH given #90 oxycontin prescribed [**4-9**] and #10 left on admission on [**4-10**].
# Acute renal failure on admission: FeNa of 0.4% suggested a prerenal etiology.
Renal ultrasound negative for obstruction.
# H/o glucose intolerance/steroid induced diabetes: He had persistent hyperglycemia, thought to be due to his steroid use, though there was concern for underlying glucose intolerance.
The patient was unwilling to comply with any diabetic diet.
His dose of QHS Lantus was slowly increased up to 20 units, but he remained very hyperglycemic, requiring large doses of Humalog with each meal.
After he has completed his steroids, he should have a fasting glucose in case of underlying chronic diabetes.
# Pain control: Pt reports chronic pain on oxycodone.
# CAD: Has a h/o multiple MIs.
He again complained of chest pain [**4-24**].
EKG was again unchanged and his pain improved with Maalox.
# Noncompliance: He has a h/o multiple AMA discharges.
