No clicks or diastolic murmurs audible.
Chest x-rays on admission showed a normal heart size, small sinus, situs solitus and appears top have left sided arch.
An echocardiogram was done on [**2176-4-25**] and the results showed valvular aortic stenosis, thickened doming aortic valve leaflets with a posterior commisural opening, probably a pseudo-unicommissural valve.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
No aortic regurgitation.
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
No mitral regurgitation.
Left aortic arch.
No coarctation.
No retrograde diastolic flow in the descending aorta.
2 atrial septal defects with left to right flow.
No tricuspid regurg.
A follow-up echocardiogram was done on [**2176-4-26**] which showed a unicommissural aortic valve with aortic stenosis.
Severe aortic stenosis.
