CT HEAD:IMPRESSION: Prominent periventricular white matter disease, likely related to small vessel ischemia.
Otherwise, no acute intracranial abnormality, vascular abnormality or abnormal focus of contrast enhancement.
Prominent periventricular white matter disease and ventriculomegaly, both of which appear unchanged from the comparison CT exam.
Brief Hospital Course: 63M intubated in the setting of altered mental status, with ?
# Mental status: Initial differential included seizure, toxic-metabolic (hyponatremia), stroke unlikely given CTA imaging, CNS infection (initially afebrile but then developed fever on arrival).
EEG was without any evidence of seizure.
Prominent periventricular white matter disease and ventriculomegaly, both of which appear unchanged from the comparison CT exam.
Hyponatremia was attributed to decreased oral intake and effect of HCTZ.
Hyponatremia resolved with normal saline administration.
# Elevated CK: This was thought initially to be an effect of a seizure.
Fluids were given at a generous rate and the patient did not develop any evidence of renal failure.
# Respiratory Failure: Intubated in the setting of obtundation and possible seizure.
No problems with oxygenation.
Chest x-ray with aspiration vs atelectasis on left side.
He did not have an oxygen requirement.
