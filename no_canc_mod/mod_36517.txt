Labs were notable for hyponatremia to the 120s, mild anemia.
Chest xray showed no acute CP process.
On the floor, pt continues to be stridorous and is difficulty to understand due to mask/heliox.

Simple fluid lining the posterior [**Last Name (un) **]-, oro-, and laryngopharynx, and anterior laryngopharynx, findings likely secondary to recent intubation.
No compressive extrinsic enhancing mass lesion to explain patient's stridor.
However, assessment for endoluminal lesions or abnormalities is limited due to intubation.
Mild paraseptal emphysema in the lung apices.
Stable degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo gentleman with hx of MICU admission for stridor with no evidence of obstruction, now presenting with recurrent stridor.
Stridor: Initially unclear cause of his stridor given normal laryngoscope on last visit.
CT scan of the neck did not show any extraluminal masses compressing.
During the brief extubation, a laryngoscopy was done that was concerning for at least partial paralysis of the vocal cords.
[**10-29**] he had a tracheostomy placed by the ENT service with some difficulty because of his severe scoliosis and altered anatomy.
With the concomitant dysphagia, there was concern for neuromuscular weakness, so neurology was consulted.
The next test Neurology recommended was an EMG, this demonstrated a pattern consistent with a myopathy.
LEMG was EMG suggestive of neuromuscular junction disorder.
Dysphagia: patient had been having several weeks of worsening dysphagia prior to admission, including weight loss.
He had an EGD [**2179-10-2**] for similar symptoms that did not show a cause for dysphagia.
Patient declined video swallow study.
Anemia: at baseline, no evidence of active bleeding, with low iron [**9-14**], nl ferritin, iron/TIBC<18 concerning for iron deficiency.
Likely from poor PO intake.
Tachycardia: sinus, likely due to resp distress.
Transitional Issues: There are several tests requested by Neurology that were sent off by pathology to outside facility that are pending prior to discharge.
6. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet [**Month/Year (2) **]: 1-2 Tablets PO Q 8H (Every 8  Hours) as needed for [**Month/Year (2) **] or pain.
7. nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual [**Month/Year (2) **]: One (1) tablet Sublingual as needed as needed for chest pain: Take one tablet under tonque every 5 inutes up to 3 pills, if pain persists call  doctor.
ProAir HFA 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler [**Month/Year (2) **]: [**12-6**] puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for wheeze.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
4. trazodone 50 mg Tablet [**Month/Day (2) **]: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
