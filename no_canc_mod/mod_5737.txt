HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71-year-old Asian male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus and complete heart block who was noted to have a right great toe ulcer several weeks ago after a corn was trimmed.
He was then sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] who felt that a bypass was also needed as well and he was then admitted for further evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2136**], complete heart block leading to cardiac arrest, shock and intubation in [**2140-2-2**].
Diabetes mellitus since age 30, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peptic ulcer disease with a history of upper GI bleed while on IV Heparin and pneumonia.
He was then taken down to the angiography suite later that day for an arteriogram which revealed mild bilateral renal artery stenoses.
No significant aortoiliac disease.
Mild to moderate right superficial femoral artery disease and moderate to severe popliteal artery disease.
An occluded right anterior tibial artery at the origin.
Right posterior tibial artery with multiple stenoses, but constituting major run-off to the foot.
Based on these findings, the patient was then sent for arm vein mapping as he did have reconstructible peripheral vascular disease.
They felt that he was at a significant risk secondary to his co-morbidities.
They recommended not continuing Lopressor as the patient had history of severe bradycardia going into cardiac arrest in the past.
When the patient was hooked up to the monitor it was noted that he had severe bradycardia with heart rates in the 30's to 40's.
