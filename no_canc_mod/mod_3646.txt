Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 94 0 82 364/423 0 33 51  CXR 1 view: SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart size is mildly enlarged.
The aorta is slightly tortuous.
There is fullness of the hila bilaterally and there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Linear opacities within the right upper lobe may reflect scarring and chronic changes.
There is likely mild streaky opacity in left lung base, reflective of atelectasis.
No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is visualized.
No definite displaced rib fractures are seen; however, the left lateral ribs are not completely included in the field of view.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Probable left basilar atelectasis and chronic changes within the right upper lobe.
Pelvis Xray - 1 view: AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS, TWO VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FEMUR: No definite fracture or dislocation is present.
There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures which limits the detection for subtle fractures.
The right leg is rotated, though no distinct fracture line is visible.
There are mild degenerative changes in both hips with joint space narrowing.
No diastasis of the pubic symphysis or sacroiliac joints is seen.
There are diffuse vascular calcifications.
Extensive degenerative changes are noted within the imaged aspect of the right knee with joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis and osteophyte formation.
A moderate-sized suprapatellar joint effusion is also noted.
IMPRESSION: Rotation of the right femur, but no definite fracture or dislocation.
If there is continued clinical concern for an occult fracture, a CT is recommended for further evaluation.
Femur Xray - 2view: AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS, TWO VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FEMUR: No definite fracture or dislocation is present.

No acute vertebral body fractures are seen.
There is a chronic wedge compression deformity of T2 (602B:36).
Severe multilevel degenerative changes are seen throughout the cervical spine, worst at C3/4 and the C6/7, there is loss of intervertebral disc space with endplate sclerosis and subchondral cystic changes.
Subluxation of multiple facets are compatible with severe osteoarthropathy.
Included views of the lung apices demonstrate scarring and pleural calcifications, as seen on the prior chest radiograph (5:61).
Chronic wedge compression deformity at T2.
Severe multilevel degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine.
Numerous bifrontal and left temporal intraparenchymal hematomas, unchanged in appearance since the 1:01 p.m. study, with new trace intraventricular extension.
Findings are most compatible with traumatic contusion injuries.
If the diagnosis is in doubt and amyloid angiopathy is being entertained as a potential diagnosis, then MR may be of potential value in further assessment.
Very small subdural hygromas, not significantly changed and also supporting the probability of a traumatic etiology.
slightly increased focus of hemorrhage at left frontal lobe (2,20) and slightly less prominent foci at the left frontal lobe at the vertex (2, 23)when compared to the comparable level and allowing for differences in technique.
Small subdural hygromas stable.
Minimally increased vasogenic edema particularly at the level of the the left frontal lobe at the vertex (2, 23).
MRI Head without contrast: FINDINGS: Multiple foci of blood products are seen in both frontal lobes, left temporal lobe and intraventricular blood is also identified.
There are bilateral small subdural collections seen extending from frontal to the occipital region with a maximum width of approximately 6 mm on the left and 5 mm on the right side.
There is mild indentation on the adjacent sulci seen.
There is no mass effect or midline shift seen.
Mild changes of small vessel disease are noted.
IMPRESSION: Blood products in both frontal and left temporal region likely due to hemorrhagic contusions, although the locations of the abnormalities are somewhat atypical.
No evidence of chronic microhemorrhages seen in other parts of the brain to suggest underlying abnormality.
Small bilateral subdural collections are seen.
Imaging of his head showed several areas of hemorrhage in bifrontal and left temporal areas.
He was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
The patient also had an issue with hypernatremia and was started on normal saline at 70 cc/hr for treatment.
He should get labs daily at rehab, and may need further treamtent for his hypernatremia.
One of the major issues during his stay was his mental status.
He was stopped due to intracranial hemorrhages.
Having atrial fibrillation puts him at risk for embolic strokes.
2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
5. glucagon (human recombinant) 1 mg Recon Soln Sig: One (1) Recon Soln Injection Q15MIN () as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.
7. dextrose 50% in water (D50W)     Syringe Sig: One (1) Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: bifrontal and left temporal hemorrhages   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Imaging of your head showed several areas of hemorrhage in your brain.
Having atrial fibrillation puts you at risk for blood clots which can cause strokes.
