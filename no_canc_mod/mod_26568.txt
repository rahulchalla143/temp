You were transferred here because you were bleeding in your digestive tract and had abdominal pain, as well as an INR of 14.
We also stopped your warfarin(coumadin) and started you on a heparin drip for your mechanical valve.
To assess your bleeding and pain, we performed CT-scans of your abdomen and the GI team performed several endoscopies.
Most likely, the symptoms are related to your chronic diverticular disease (small outpouchings of your colon.
We are treating you for possible diverticulitis with antibiotics.
We recommend that you eat a low-residue or low-fiber diet to help avoid future episodes of diverticulitis.
