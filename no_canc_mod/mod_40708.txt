Admission Date:  [**2153-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-4-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-4-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**] Chief Complaint: Wegeners granulomatosis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CT guided biopsy Chest tube placement and removal Kidney biopsy   History of Present Illness: 34 y/o M with PMHx of DM I who was recently admitted [**Date range (3) 89453**] for work-up of anemia of unclear etiology.
During his admission he was noted to have eosinophilia, coagulopathy, infiltrates and an anterior mediastinal mass.
He was seen by [**Location (un) 2274**] Hematology/Oncology, and [**Hospital1 18**] pulmonary and thoracic surgery.
Bone marrow biopsy showed bone marrow suppression and iron deficiency.
His mediastinal mass felt to most likely be a thymoma, and would tie together all of his other findings including anemia, atypical pneumonia and recurrent sinus infections with eosinophilia and coagulopathy.
He had a bronchoscopy with BAL which was negative for pathogens (some still pending) or eosinophilic predominance.
He had an MRI of the chest which showed Round heterogeneous lesion in the anterior mediastinum measuring 5.4 x 3.9 x 4.7 cm without appreciable loss of signal intensity on out-of-phase imaging with mild enhancement.
Findings are NOT consistent with thymic hyperplasia.
Thoracic surgery decided no biopsy should be performed as risk of seeding the surrounding tissue if this is malignant.
Incidentally during his work up, P-ANCA was preliminarily positive and thought to be paraneoplastic, but they were awaiting confirmatory results from [**Hospital1 2025**].
Patient had labs drawn yesterday and notably his Hct was 20.1, wbc: 12.0 On the floor, patient denies complaints.

NOTE: Sections reveal fragments of renal parenchyma containing approximately 33 glomeruli, one or two of which, depending on the level, are globally sclerotic.
Glomerular necrotizing lesions are noted associated with mild extracapillary proliferation (very small crescent formation).
Mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are noted accompanied by chronic inflammation.
The small arteries/arterioles show mild fibrotic changes.
There is no staining with IgG or IgM.
Findings are those of a glomerulonephritis of the type associated with the ANCA vasculitic syndromes.
[**2153-4-13**] mediastinal mass cytology: IMPRESSION: Technically successful aspiration of a predominantly cystic anterior mediastinal mass.
FNA, Anterior mediastinal mass: NON-DIAGNOSTIC Specimen consists of scattered macrophages.
FINDINGS: Tiny left apical pneumothorax has decreased in size since the priorradiograph.
Bilateral patchy infrahilar opacities have slightly improved.
Subtle ground-glass opacities are present and shown to better detail on recent CT scan.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 89454**] is a 34 year-old male with Type I DM and recent complicated history and hospitalizations for a mediastinal mass now thought to be a thymic cyst, vasculitis with DAH on BAL thought to be Wegeners granulomatosis (also with renal involvement confirmed on biopsy) whose course has been complicated by pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement and removal s/p high dose methylprednisolone and first dose of rituxan.
He was found to have a high titer positive for C-ANCA after extensive workup of iron deficiency anemia on prior hospitalization.
As he did have a mediastinal mass, the concern was that this may be lymphoma and steroids would partially treat, obscuring a diagnosis.
After renal biopsy confirmed acute changes consistent with Wegner's in the kidney, the rheumatology and renal consult teams conferred and decided to treat him with rituxan (instead of cytoxan) due to rituxan's more favorable side effect profile.
He was given his first rituxan infusion on [**4-19**] without complication and will receive 3 more infusions over the next month.
# Hyperglycemia/Type I diabetes:  The patient had worsening control of blood sugars with high dose steroids.
His blood sugars decreased on increased lantus dosing (now at 35 qam and 30 qpm) and an increased humalog sliding scale.
He was treated with high-dose steroids without change in clinical status which makes it even more unlikely this is lymphoma.
# Anemia:  Thought to be secondary to blood loss from likely DAH from Wegeners.
#  Hemopneumothorax:  Complication of mediastinal biopsy.
The patient was found to be more hypoxic on [**2153-4-14**], tachycardic and with chest pain on the left.
Exam was significant for hyperresonance.
CXR revealed large hemopneumothorax with mild tension.
Follow up CXR on [**4-16**] showed continued resolution.
# Leukocytosis:   Thought to be secondary to steroids.
No clinical evidence of infection.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Wegeners granulomatosis Thymic cyst Hemopneumothorax  Secondary diagnoses: Diabetes Type I Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had a biopsy of the mass in your chest which was found to be a cyst.
You suffered a complication of this procedure which was a pneumothorax (collapse of part of the lung).
Hematology/oncology had evaluated you during your stay and felt that it was very unlikely that the mass in your chest was a lymphoma or other cancer, but this has not been definately ruled out.
You will need a repeat chest imaging in 3 months to check for any change in the mass/cyst.
You can use tylenol as need for pain control.
