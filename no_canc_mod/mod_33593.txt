HISTORY:  [**Location (un) **] is a full-term male infant born weighing 3.825 kg to a 39-year-old gravida 4, para 0, now 1 female via cesarean section secondary to a nonreactive fetal heart rate tracing.
The pregnancy was complicated by maternal fibroids.
He cried at the perineum, but then required vigorous stimulation by the team, with poor initial respiratory effort.
The infant developed tachypnea into the 70s and 80s in the newborn nursery, and retrotransfer to the NICU was made.
PROBLEMS DURING STAY IN NEWBORN NURSERY:  On admission, he was noted to have peeling skin, with postdates appearance  and tachypnea with coarse breath sounds and occasional grunting.
X-ray     revealed an unusual opacity in the left lateral aspect     of the left upper lobe and lucency medially.
This was     thought to represent some lung collapse and a medial     pneumothorax.
There were no cardiac issues.
