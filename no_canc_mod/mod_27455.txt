There is improvement of the pulmonary edema since the previous study.
There remains a left-sided pleural effusion and left retrocardiac opacity.
Atelectasis within the right mid lung zone is again seen.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe symmetric LVH.
Mildly dilated LV cavity.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Partial mitral leaflet flail.
Severe mitral annular calcification.
Severe thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Eccentric MR jet.
Severe (4+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate to severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is severe thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
An eccentric, anteriorly and posteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is systolic reversal as noted by pulse wave doppler of both sided pulmonary veins.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The valve is well seated; there is good leaflet excursion and there is no paravalvular leak or mitral regurgitations.
There is no change in the velocity across the LVOTat rest and measures 2.4 cm/s.
He was started on amiodarone for ventricular ectopy and continued for atrial fibrillation.
He had a slight increase in his creat which imporved with a decrease in his lasix.
