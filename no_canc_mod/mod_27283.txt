Over the past 3 months, he has reported progressively worsening achy chest pain that radiates into both shoulders and is associated with SOB, but not nausea, diaphoresis or palpitations.
As a result of these symptoms, he presented for cath on [**2173-1-20**] at [**Location (un) 20338**] which showed LAD 60% proximal stenosis, RCA diffusely diseased with 90% discrete PDA.
L heart cath showed serial 90% lesions in a tortuous vessel with the PLB /PDA having origin 90% lesions.
A stat TTE was ordered which showed no evidence of pericardial effusion.
On admission to the CCU, he was hypertensive with SBP in 170s.
He received 0.5 mg atropine and bolus 250 cc NS with hemodynamic stabilization.
The interventional fellow was present during the episode of hypotension and bradycardia.

He pressetned with recent onset angina with an angiogram in [**State 108**] showing occluded LIMA to D, SVG to LAD and SVG to RCA.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 yo M with h/o HTN, HL, CVA in [**2157**], MI in [**2157**], [**2167**] and [**2168**] as well as CABGx4 in [**2167**] presenting for elective interventional cath of RCA lesion complicated by jailing of the PDA and subsequent perforation.
The patient has an extensive CAD history with LAD 60% proximal stenosis, RCA diffusely diseased with 90% discrete PDA.
A STAT echo after catheterization showed no evidence of pericardial effusion.
His pulsus was monitored Q6 the day following catheterization without elevation.
A repeat echocardiogram the day following catheterization showed only a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion and normal ejection fraction of > 55%, normal RV and LV cavity size.
Please seek medical attention if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, sweating, fevers, chills or have any other concerning symptoms.
