Small bilateral pneumothoraces, along with scattered ground-glass opacities likely representing a combination of aspiration and pulmonary contusion.
Linear lucency in the right lobe of the liver suggestive of a laceration as well as multiple linear lucencies in the right kidney, again suggestive of Grade II laceration.

[**2156-11-12**]   Radiology UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus of the right internal jugular vein.
No deep vein thrombosis identified in the right arm.
There was concern for vascular injury in his right leg and he underwent a CT angiogram which did not reveal any acute injury; upon exam he was neurovascularly intact.
He was taken to the operating room for right tube thoracostomy and washout, debridement open tibia wound to bone, arthrotomy with debridement of ankle, intramedullary nail tibia fracture and closed reduction of the humerus fracture with manipulation.
There were no intraoperative complications.
He did have periods of agitation and was started on Clonidine.
He was fitted for a TLSO brace and this will need to be worn at all times while he is out of bed.
Because of his injuries there were some pain control issues; he initially required IV narcotics and was later changed to Methadone and Oxycodone which appear to be controlling his pain adequately at this point.
He developed right arm swelling and there was concern for a thrombus.
He underwent ultrasound of his upper extremity which revealed non-occlusive thrombus of the right internal jugular vein but no deep vein thrombosis was identified in the right arm.
The swelling remains but has diminished.
