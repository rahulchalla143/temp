Mild anterolateral displacement of the fibular diaphysis noting approximately 1cm lateral displacement.
Minimally comminuted, oblique fracture involving the distal tibial metiaphysis w/ lateral displacement of the distal tibia a full diaphyseal width.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for orthopedic evaluation.
On exam, he was noted to have a diffusely swollen R lower leg.
His abdomen was protuberant with + fluid wave.
He was given morphine for pain and 1 L NS.
In the PACU, patient was given dilaudid for pain control.
He reports [**2192-7-16**] pain in his RLE.
Denies h/o DTs or seizures.
Has had some minor intermittent congestion.

studies/imaging [**7-27**] KUB: Non-specific bowel pattern without evidence of obstruction.
Coarse liver echotexture suggestive of underlying cirrhosis.
No discrete hepatic lesion is seen.
LOWER EXTREMITY FLUORO: Multiple fluoroscopic images of the right lower leg from the operating room demonstrate interval placement of an intramedullary rod with distal and proximal interlocking screws fixating a spirally oriented fracture to the distal tibial metaphysis.
There are no signs of hardware-related complications.
There is also a fracture involving the proximal right fibular shaft with a prominent butterfly fragment.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Non-specific repolarization abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo M with hx of ETOH abuse and cirrhosis, s/p mechanical fall found to have comminuted tib/fib fracture and compartment syndrome.
# Tib/fib fracture/compartment syndrome: Pt was admitted with tib/fib fracture with anemia [**3-13**] significant blood loss and complicated by compartment syndrome with pressure of 60mmHg.
Patient underwent tibial repair w/ nail and fasciotomy with 2 wound vacs on medial and lateral side of leg.
He went back to the OR on [**7-30**] for medial closure.
He again returned to the OR on [**8-1**] for skin graft and lateral wound closure.
He was initially started on an ativan CIWA scale given liver disease which was then switched to valium.
Patient became increasingly confused and remained persistently tremulous and tachycardic, requiring frequent benzodiezapines.
His benzo requirement was minimal and he was transferred back to the medical floor.
# Thromboycytopenia: In the ED, platelet count was 37 with improvement to 91 after 1 unit.
The patient continued to have low platelets after ORIF and was given a 2nd unit.
Low platelets likely [**3-13**] to alcoholic cirrhosis and recent surgery.
There was no evidence of DIC given negative FDP.
# presumed EtOH cirrhosis - most likely ETOH related with AST>ALT.
He had a RUQ ultrasound with evidence of cirrhosis but no ascites or portal thrombosis seen.
# positive blood culture - Patient found to have 1/2 blood cultures positive for gram positive cocci which was speciated to be coag negative gram positive cocci.
Given the result and the subsiquent lack of fevers he was transitioned back to cefazolin.
He continued to be afebrile during his stay and the cefazolin was discontinued on [**8-6**] after takedown by ortho of the wound vac.
# Anemia NOS/macrocytic anemia - Patient noted to have a significant HCT drop during admission and a macrocytic anemia.
HCT drop likely related to recent surgery.
There was evidence of GI bleed.
He will have follow-up with GI/Liver as an outpatient to further delineate the degree of liver damage and confirm the cause.

You were also noted to have symptoms of alcohol withdrawal on admission and were treated appropriately.
You will need to establish care with a liver doctor to have a full workup and evaluation.
The following changes have been made to your medication regimen Please START taking - lovenox for 26 more days - oxycodone as needed for pain - colace, senna, and miralax while on pain medication to avoid consipation  Please follow up with your appointments below for both Ortho and Liver.
