Admission Date:  [**2111-3-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2111-3-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2036-4-3**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2110-11-6**], with multiple complications, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] from [**Hospital3 105**] for management of question of possible empyema.
The patient was hospitalized here in the month of [**Month (only) 404**] for respiratory failure with pseudomonas pneumonia, cryptococcemia and amiodarone-induced lung disease.
Ten days prior to admission, the patient developed increased shortness of breath with bilateral pleural effusions.
Linezolid was started, with clinical improvement, but four days later, the patient had increased shortness of breath and pseudomonas in the sputum, sensitive only to amikacin.
Sputum was also noted to be positive for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus on [**2111-3-5**].

History of gastrointestinal bleed secondary to mucosal tear at the gastrostomy site 9.
Hyperlipidemia 10.

History of pseudomonas pneumonia in [**2111-1-6**] 14.
History of cryptococcemia and cryptococcus in the pleural fluid in [**2111-1-6**], treated with AmBisome and now on fluconazole  MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: 1.
General appearance:  The patient is frail, cachectic-appearing male, in no acute distress.
Moist mucous membranes, oropharynx without lesions.
Neck:  Supple, with no carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2, II/VI systolic murmur, irregularly irregular rhythm.
Lungs: Decreased effort, clear breath sounds, decreased diaphragmatic excursion, coarse crackles, scattered bilaterally, with no appreciable rubs.
Abdomen:  Soft, hypoactive bowel sounds, nontender to palpation, no appreciable mass or hepatosplenomegaly.
Brachial and radial pulses appreciable bilaterally, with no lower extremity cyanosis or clubbing.
Strength is decreased diffusely, with no focal neurological deficits.
Infectious Disease:  The patient presented with bilateral pleural effusions, with recently-tapped left pleural effusion with a reported pH of 7.08.
Right pleural effusion was notable for the following laboratory findings: 56 white blood cells, 33,625 red blood cells, protein of 3.2, glucose of 44, LDH of [**2046**], pH of 7.94, Gram stain revealing 1+ polys.
Left-sided pleural effusion notable for 384,000 red blood cells, 378 white blood cells, 55% polys, protein of 2.9, glucose of 63, LDH of 630, amylase of 11, pH of 7.50, Gram stain revealed 2+ polys.
Ultimately pleural fluid culture did grow out vancomycin-resistant enterococcus from one bottle, which was thought to be a colonizer.
Analysis of the pleural fluid suggested that it was exudative.
Given the high red blood cell count and high LDH, it was concerning for malignant effusion, but cytology was negative.
It was also thought that there was potentially some component of congestive heart failure contributing to the effusions.
The patient did not, however, present with frank evidence of congestive heart failure during this hospitalization, though with an echocardiogram that showed no change from prior.
Blood was positive for cryptococcal antigen, and the patient was continued on his fluconazole.
Sputum cultures taken early in this hospitalization grew out multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas, as has been colonized in the past.
The urine also grew out resistant pseudomonas.
Sensitivities revealed that the organism was sensitive to both of these.
The patient did grow vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in the pleural fluid in the setting of treatment with linezolid.
The patient did show evidence of oral thrush, and was treated with Nystatin and continued on his fluconazole.
Pulmonary:  As noted above, the patient was treated with amikacin and Zosyn for pseudomonal respiratory tract infection.
The organism was not cultured from the pleural fluid, and the pleural fluid analysis was not entirely consistent with an infectious etiology.
The patient should also receive at least an additional six weeks total therapy with fluconazole for cryptococcal pneumonia, as the patient has a history of cryptococcemia.
The patient remained ventilator dependent during this hospitalization secondary to multifactorial pulmonary processes, namely pneumonia, possible amiodarone toxicity, and bilateral pleural effusions of mixed etiology, possibly with components of both transudate and exudate.
The patient's chest x-ray revealed pulmonary infiltrates thought to reflect prior amiodarone toxicity vs. new ventilator associated or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
The patient remained essentially afebrile throughout the remainder of his hospitalization, with several low-grade fevers on [**3-15**] and [**2111-3-16**], for which cultures were sent.
It was noted that he continued to grow moderate pseudomonas from his oropharynx despite treatment with amikacin and Zosyn.
He continued to have thick secretions.
Congestive heart failure:  Patient with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient's beta blocker was held for much of this hospitalization, given low blood pressures.
This was done, in part, given suspicion that congestive heart failure was possibly contributing to his bilateral pleural effusions.
Regarding his history of congestive heart failure, the patient had a recent echocardiogram revealing ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
The patient had a repeat echocardiogram during this hospitalization, which again showed ejection fraction greater than 55%, abnormal septal motion consistent with a right ventricular pressure overload, 1+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation.
The patient received several one-time doses of 40 mg of intravenous lasix for suspicion for total volume overload.
The patient, however, did not have any clear evidence of acute congestive heart failure compromising his oxygenation during this hospitalization.
Regarding history of atrial fibrillation, the patient had several periods of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, although he had never had any associated hemodynamic instability.
Hematology:  Patient with anemia, noted to have a slow drop in his hematocrit of approximately 6 to 7 points over approximately a week or two.
He is guaiac negative, and had no evidence of acute bleeding.
Anemia laboratories were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Given the fact that he had been revascularized, it was considered essential to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 for cardio-protective reasons.
Gastrointestinal:  Patient with several complaints of right upper quadrant pain early in his hospitalization, which later resolved.
He was noted to have persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase  and elevated GGT, although the rest of his liver function tests were within normal limits.
There was no evidence of any acute biliary process.
Suspicion for gastrointestinal bleed was addressed as above.
We gave him lasix on several occasions to keep him negative, given suspicion that congestive heart failure may be contributing to his respiratory status and his bilateral pleural effusions.
He was, however, noted to have an approximately ten pound weight loss during his hospitalization.
Access:  Patient with a right PICC line, which he has had in place for his antibiotic treatments since [**Month (only) 404**].
Exudative pleural effusions status post chest tube placement and discontinuation 2.
Pseudomonas respiratory tract infection 3.
History of anemia of chronic disease 4.
Cryptococcal pneumonia with history of cryptococcemia 5.
Coronary artery disease 9.
Chronic atrial fibrillation  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
Nystatin paint to oral mucous membranes four times a day as needed for thrush 12.
Lorazepam 1 to 2 mg intravenously every four hours as needed for agitation 14.
His PICC line should be monitored for signs of infection.
