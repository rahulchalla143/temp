1.
CXR [**2179-5-19**] INDICATION: History of shortness of breath.
Evaluate for CHF or cardiopulmonary changes.
PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: Again seen is marked scoliosis and kyphosis.
There has been interval development of a moderate-sized right pleural effusion, though underlying infiltrate or consolidation in this area cannot be definitively excluded.
There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which may suggest a tiny left-sided pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: New moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
A tiny left pleural effusion.
TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT. CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: No acute intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is a collection of CSF density within the right hemisphere, adjacent to the falx and extending to the level of the vertex.
This may represent an arachnoid cyst.
This is felt less likely to represent an area of encephalomalacia as the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle appears anteriorly displaced.
There is diffuse prominence of the ventricles and sulci, consistent with involutional change.
BONE WINDOWS: Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of fracture within the surrounding osseous structures.
IMPRESSION: 1) No acute intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of acute edema.
2) Cystic structure within the right hemisphere likely represents an arachnoid cyst versus area of encephalomalacia.
Age-related involutional change.
3) Partial opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally, a finding that could be consistent with mastoiditis.
There are bilateral effusions.
IMPRESSION: No change in the chest over the past two days.
ECHO: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2178-2-10**], atrial fibrillation is now present and tricuspid regurgitation is now more prominent (was underestimated in the prior study) and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]F with MMP here for CHF/afib exacerbations leading to respiratory distress.
[**Age over 90 **]F with MMP here for CHF/afib exacerbations leading to respiratory distress.
Respiratory distress: multifactorial --> afib exacerbation, CHF exacerbation, r/o aspiration, r/o MI, pleural effusion, chronic lung disease (obstructive/restrictive) -r/o MI with enzymes/ekg's -r/o aspiration with bedside swallow exam --> f/u with video swallow if needed; previous swallow study was WNL and pt's mental status is much improved now, so will transition from IV to PO meds and monitor for aspiration as we await speech/swallow recs -continue supplemental O2 -treat CHF/afib as per below -hold on aspiration pna treatment for now -consider thoracentesis if pleural effusion does not respond to diuresis [**5-19**]: echo performed shows normal EF but increased TR (moderate to severe) [**5-20**]: diuresed a little more overnight, trying diamox today given increased bicarb; checking PA/lat CXR to r/o other process and assess interval change in pleural effusion [**5-21**]: giving more diamox as CXR shows persisting pleural effusions and labs still reveal an elevated bicarb; now down to 1.5L of O2 requirement [**5-25**]: giving diamox for increased weight and crackles on exam  2.
Cardiac: HTN, afib, diastolic dysfunction CHF, r/o MI -for now, rate control with IV/PO lopressor; [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **] IV lopressor dose with PO dose 30 minutes later -telemetery -r/o MI with ekg/enzymes -lasix as bp tolerates, with goal of OFF supplemental O2 -will hold on afib anticoagulation pending d/w family re: goals of care, fall risk -repeat echocardiogram this admission to recheck EF, r/o any new WMA's, r/o clot -low likelihood that afib mgmt will involve cardioversion or antiarrhythmics given pt's age and multiple comorbidities [**5-20**]: better rate control on TID lopressor; starting ACE [**5-21**]: pt declining increased dose of lopressor but will continue attempting to give this to her given afib rate in 90's - 100's [**5-25**]: pt more compliant with meds, rate responding adequately; per family discussion no anticoagulation for afib given risks  3.
Mental Status Changes: likely back to baseline as she is making good sense right now and is not lethargic; her metabolic picture and hypoxia may have contributed to her delirium earlier  -continue to monitor mental status; family discussion will help this -start multivitamin -orient pt q shift if possible -hold sedating meds [**5-20**]: at baseline [**5-21**]: noted to have Enterococcus UTI despite negative UA; UA repeated and now markedly positive; Enterococcus is R to levaquin but S to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, and vancomycin; b/c pt is allergic to penicillin and nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in pt's with her creatinine clearance, pt was started on linezolid x 3 days (course to end [**5-23**]); foley catheter was kept in b/c of issues with poor urine output --> no evidence of urinary retention, and pt always responded well to diuretics; ?
poor forward flow from her CHF [**5-23**]: UTI also has MRSA growing in it; will extend linezolid coverage to 10 days to treat both enterococus and MRSA; MRSA precautions started [**5-25**]: pt has had daily recurrence of her R inguinal hernia, always reducible at the bedside but causing significant anorexia and abdominal pain when not reduced; per family discussion, given pt's very recent cardiopulmonary problems (new afib, Class [**Name (NI) 1105**]/IV heart failure, chronic lung disease) she would be at extremely high risk for cardiopulmonary demise perioperatively --> deferring surgery at least 1-2 months, will need almost daily reduction of hernia at the bedside and this is preferable to surgery at this time  4.
aspiration risk, diurese to goal OFF supplemental O2 [**5-19**]: speech and swallow consult obtained --> no evidence of aspiration, food type recommendations left in chart (see d/c plan for more info) [**5-20**]: pt developed hypernatremia which resolved with IV free water repletion [**5-23**]: free water repleted, no further problems  6.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal once a day as needed for constipation.
Tramadol HCl 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for breakthrough pain.
Diamox Sequels 500 mg Capsule, Sustained Release Sig: one half Capsule, Sustained Release PO once a day as needed for increased SOB, increased weight (3lbs), increased O2 requirement: give if CHF + bicarb greater than or equal to 32; if bicarb is less than this, CHF diuretic of choice is lasix.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. atrial fibrillation out of control, now controlled 2.
CHF exacerbation (EF normal, ?
Restrictive + Obstructive lung disease with saturations 90% on room air at baseline.
4. mental status changes, likely [**2-17**] Enterococcus and MRSA UTI, resolved 5.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Breast cancer in the [**2154**]'s and a right mastectomy.
13. inguinal hernia, reducible with pressure   Discharge Condition: fair  Discharge Instructions: 1. d/c to long term rehab 2. new medications: metoprolol (increased dose), linezolid, sliding scale insulin, tramadol, will occasionally need lasix or diamox 3. please check CBC QDay while on linezolid; please check Chem7 every day that she receives a diuretic (lasix or diamox) 4. she should be kept on a 2L fluid restriction and a low Na / cardiac diet; encourage PO free water intake (up to 2L), but if her Na increases she will likely need IV free water (D5W) repletion 5. follow up with PCP in one week to reassess CHF, UTI, afib 6. contact precautions (MRSA) 7. if increased crackles on exam, increased O2 requirement, or increased weight of 3lbs or more, consider diuresing with 80mg PO lasix (if bicarb is less than 32) or with 125-250mg PO diamox (if bicarb is greater than or equal to 32)  Followup Instructions: with your PCP in one week for follow up of your CHF, afib, and UTI                               [**Name6 (MD) 251**] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD [**MD Number(1) 910**]  Completed by:[**2179-5-25**
