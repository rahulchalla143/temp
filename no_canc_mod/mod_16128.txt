Admission Date:  [**2196-9-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2196-10-12**]   Service: Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] is an 82 year-old Asian male with a history of dementia, who was transferred from the MICU to the floor following a long stay for respiratory failure, complicated by fevers and complicated by bilateral iatrogenic pneumothoraces requiring chest tube placement.
The Emergency Department course is also notable for hypotension requiring Levophed, as well as witnessed aspiration event.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] complications of the left chest tube resulted in a left tented pneumothorax as well as a right sided pneumothorax presumed secondary to high PIPs in the 90s.
The patient was initially begun on Levofloxacin/Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia with bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray.
The patient intermittently spiked fevers in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for which Vancomycin was added on [**2196-9-30**].
In addition, the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, which was responsive to Adenosine and vagal maneuvers.
A neurology consult was obtained who felt that anoxic brain injury was highly unlikely and his prognosis for recovery was poor.
Cardiovascular distal heart sounds without murmurs.
RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray on [**10-6**] bilateral basilar lower lobe opacities right greater then left increasing over the past few days.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is an 82 year-old Asian male with baseline dementia who is initially admitted after a prolonged cardiac/respiratory arrest.
He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with anoxic brain injury secondary to prolonged cardiac and respiratory arrest.
In addition his hospital course was complicated by pneumothoraces as well as continued aspiration.
Upon transfer to the floor the patient was currently aspirating with worsening bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, and the risk of recurrent arrest or decompensation was high.
His fevers are likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia versus central in origin.
Because of worsening infiltrates the patient was continued on aspiration coverage with Levofloxacin/Flagyl.
This increasing ratio is likely indicated of a prerenal insufficiency.
The [**Hospital 228**] medical condition was discussed and at the patient's current state he was at extremely high risk of decompensation and another cardiopulmonary arrest.
[**Doctor Last Name **] also stated that he wished that his father would "go peacefully" with no intervention.
A plan was made that the patient would be kept on supplemental oxygen for comfort, given prn morphine, oral suctioning as needed for comfort, as well as Scopolamine patches to decrease secretions.
The patient's course continued to decline from [**10-7**] through [**10-12**] and he was without spontaneous movement.
On [**10-10**] the patient began having increased secretions, increased gurgling and his respiratory status became more labored.
In addition, the patient began to have increased work of breathing.
Dementia secondary to Alzheimer's disease.
Continued aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia.
Iatrogenic pneumothorax status post subclavian line attempt.
Left tension pneumothorax, secondary to displacement of left sided chest tube, which also resulted in a small right pneumothorax.
Status post placement of bilateral chest tubes and removal of bilateral chest tubes.
Acute respiratory failure, requiring ventilator support while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
