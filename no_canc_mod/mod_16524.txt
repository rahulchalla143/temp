Patient noticed chest pain, similar in quality to his previous angina pain while shaving this morning.
The pain was described as moderate, located at midsternal region, dull in quality, and responded partially to nitroglycerine X3.
Upon arrival to the ED, there was no EKG changs or elevation of troponin.
In the cath lab, there was a 60-70% stenosis of the LCX, with widely patent stents, balloon angioplasty was perfromed from LCX into L main, and no stents were placed.
Patient's chest pain resolved 30 mins during the procedure, but not temporally associated with PCTA.
Six days later ([**7-2**]) patient had similar chest pain, underwent another catheterization with stent placement in LCx, and resulted in normal flow, with no dissection or residual stenosis.
He is free of chest pain or shortness breath.

Initial plan was to cross the lesion involving the ostial circumflex by a RADI pressure wire, but due to the severe angulation and newly deployed stents in the proximal LCX, this was not technically possible.
After much difficulty, a Choice PT [**Name (NI) 9165**] intermediate wire was delivered across the lesion with the help of an Echelon microcatheter.
At this point patient started complaining of chest pain ([**7-1**]) which was unresponsive to IV and IC nitroglycerin at high doses.
In view of severe chest pain, the ostium of the left  circumflex coronary artery was treated by multiple balloon inflations to a maximum of 10 atm with a 2.0 x 12 mm Apex OTW, followed by a 2.5 x 12 OTW balloon.
Patient's chest pain improved to about [**3-1**] very slowly over the next 15-30 minutes.
At this point, we took notice of very slow flow in a small caliber first OM branch whose origin had a 90-95% stenosis and was jailed by the previously deployed proximal LCX stent.
However, on review of previous angiograms, it was apparent that the slow flow in that branch was not a new phenomenon.
Final angiograms obtained after PCI showed no dissection, perforation or any other mechanical complication.
Optimization of anti-anginal therapy.
ETT ([**2136-7-6**]): This 75 year old man with h/o multiple PCIs most recent PCI to RCA on [**2136-6-26**] and PTCA to Cx on [**2136-7-4**] was referred to the lab for evaluation of chest pain.
Test was stopped due to bilateral hip pain.
In the presence of baseline inferolateral NSSTTW, there was ~0.5-1 mm of upsloping ST segment depression in these same leads at peak exercise/recovery (Note: ST segments difficult to interpret at peak exercise in the setting of artifact).
The rhythm was sinus with occasional, isolated apbs throughout the study.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: 75 yo M with remote hx of coronary vasospasm, h/o CAD s/p [**11-3**] drug eluting stents in the past four years, HTN, DM2, Hyperlipidemia, diastolic CHF (EF in [**6-29**] 45-50%) with recent admission a week ago, s/p two cardiac catheterizations, p/w recurring resting angina today, and was thought to have printzmetal angina.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Angina Patient presented with resting angina, in the setting of recurrent symptoms consistent coronary artery ischemia, but no convincing evidence of EKG changes or cardiac enzyme elevation in the past week.
However, patient's angina symptom does not seem to temporally correlate with the flow of his coronary artey as observed in cath lab.
Of note, patient has remote history of NSTEMI 36 years ago that was attributed to vasospasm, and responded to calcium channel blocker treatment.
There was a transient elevation of CK-MB on HD#2, with no associated angina symptoms or EKG changes, which was most likely a result of periprocedure ischemia.
An exercise stress test was done on the third day that showed non-specific ST-T wave changes.
The test was terminated prematurely [**1-25**] hip pain, and the patient experienced no anginal symptoms (full report in results).
At the time of discharge, he had 1+ pitting edema to the ankle which is likely related to nifedipine.
CHRONIC ISSUES # Asthma Patient has recent asthma exacerbation requiring oral steroid.
He breathes comfortably during this admission, with no wheezes or O2 requirement to maintain O2 saturation.
# Hyperlipidemia Patient has a documented history of hyperlipidemia.
# Hypertension Patient has a documented history of hypertension and takes losartan 75 mg daily at home.
He received a decreased dose at 50 mg daily considering the addition of nifedipine.
# Diabetes Patient has a history of diabetes, which was controlled by metformin.
# Chronic kidney disease Patient has a documented history of chronic kidney disease.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY Coronary Vasospasm SECONDARY Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Coronary artery disease  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for angina, for which you had a cardiac cathetarization that showed single vessle coronary disease.
You also had an exerceise treadmill test to asses your exercise tolerance that showed non specific ST-T wave changes of unknown significance.
The Cardiology team feels that your angina is most likely due to coronary vasospasm, and you were started on a calcium channel blocker.
