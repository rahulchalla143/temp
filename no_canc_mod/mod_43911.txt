Admission Date:  [**2180-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-1-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-10-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Tetracycline  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with no intervention   History of Present Illness: 72F with no significant past cardiac history who had sudden onset chest pressure while shoveling snow on day of admission.
She describes it as chest "tightness," shakiness and diaphoresis.
Patient was noted to have SSCP and was given 1 SLNG and 2 mg morphine 2 mg IV, acetaminophen 1 g with adequate pain relief.
Trop was elevated to 0.12.
Prior to cath, she was started heparin gtt with bolus and a plavix load of 600 mg.   Brought to cath lab and found plaque rupture at origin of LAD, right at junction of LAD and Lcx, with focal dissection.
She underwent echo stress test which showed no ischemic ECG changes and no anginal type symptoms with excellent functional capacity.
Echo showed no evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved workload.
In the ICU, she is pain-free, resting in bed, without complaints.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with no JVD CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
End-inspiratory crackles R>L, no  wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a 60-70% eccentric haziness in its origin with very mild staining.
There were minimal lumen irregularities in the remaining portion of the LAD.
These findings in the proximal LAD were unchanged from the angiogram obtained in [**2175**].
Non obstructive plaque rupture of the origin of the LAD by IVUS.
**Upon attending review of previous cath, LAD lesion is unchanged** .
CXR ([**2180-1-10**]): FINDINGS: There is subtle increased density in the right lower lobe likely atelectasis.
Mild left basilar atelectasis is also noted.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No displaced fracture is seen.
IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical akinesis/dyskinesis.
No left ventricular thrombus identified.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
woman s/p NSTEMI on [**2180-1-10**] with 60-70%  proximal LAD lesion was referred to the lab for evaluation.
Test was stopped due to an asymptomatic drop in systolic blood pressure during exercise.
In the presence of diffuse T wave inversions, there were no significant ST segment changes from baseline throughout the study.
Rhythm was sinus with no ectopy throughout the study.
There was an asymptomatic drop in systolic blood pressure from 94/56 to 92/52 to 82/52 to 80/52 throughout exercise.
Asymptomatic drop in systolic blood pressure during exercise.
No anginal type symptoms.
No significant ST segment changes from baseline.
Perfusion study: Resting and stress perfusion images reveal a mild fixed perfusion defect of the apex with the perfusion otherwise unremarkable.
Mild fixed apical perfusion defect, with an otherwise normal myocardial perfusion for the level of exercise achieved.
No reversible defect identified.
Small R waves versus Q waves in leads V1-V3 with mild ST segment elevation.
Possible anteroseptal myocardial infarction, age undetermined.
Since the previous tracing of [**2175-6-21**] precordial ST segment elevation is more prominent on the present tracing.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 y/o F with minimal mitral regurgitation presents with substernal chest pain after snow shoveling with troponin elevation and no EKG changes consistent with NSTEMI, now s/p cath showing non-obstructive plaque rupture at the LAD bifurcation, not amenable to stenting, and upon attending review unchanged from previous study in [**2175-6-15**].
# NSTEMI: Patient presented with anginal symptoms with elevated troponins and no appreciable EKG changes, confirming an NSTEMI.
Catheterization was suspicious for a plaque rupture at the LAD bifurcation with involvement of the left main and circumflex, not amenable to stent placement.
Cardiac surgery was initially involved for possible intervention, but further review of a previous catheterization in [**2179-6-15**] for her anginal symptoms show a very similar, unchanged lesion.
Stress-MIBI showed a mild fixed perfusion defect of the apex with the perfusion otherwise unremarkable and an EF of 70%.
Of note, the exercise portion of the study had to be stopped early due to fatigue and asymptomatic hypotension, and was suboptimal as a result.
9. clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO QHS (once a day (at bedtime)) as needed for restless legs.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*1*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Fibromyalgia Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and a cardiac catheteriation was done that showed a blockage in your left anterior descending artery that may or may not be old.
Initially we considered cardiac surgery but a stress test was done that did not show any concerning abnormalities of your heart which would require a procedure to fix.
Until then, watch for signs of fluid overload that include swelling in your legs, trouble breathing and weight gain.
Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 141**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
