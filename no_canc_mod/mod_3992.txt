Found to be in CHF in setting of hypertensive emergency.
The renal artery was re-evaluated given high suspicion of restenosis.
Post-stenting, the pt continued to have elevated BP, and worsening renal function.
She was thought to have contrast nephropathy.
Also, she had hct drop noted on [**8-5**] of 30 to 23.
MRI/MRA showed large subcapsular hematoma with active bleeding.
Past Medical History: 1. s/p Left sided nephrectomy for Renal cell CA - no chemo or XRT 2.
Diabetes Mellitus x 20 years -- currently on glyburide and insulin 3.
Hypertension 4.
Chronic renal insufficiency - Cr 1.5 in [**2111-12-1**] 5. bilateral knee replacements 6. reports benign breast lump many years ago.

Renal MRI/MRA ([**2112-8-6**]): Large perinephric hematoma including mass effect on the lateral aspect of the right kidney.
Active extravasation seen in the course of this exam though not accumulating at a very brisk rate.
No abnormality of the visualized right renal artery and the extravasation is quite lateral to any of the extrarenal renal artery branches.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 73 F with right renal artery stenosis s/p stenting complicated by subcapsular hemorrhage.
--- Pt was initially only given ASA 81 mg PO as therapy in light of her capsular hemorrhage post-renal atery stenting.
-Pump: CHF on presentation likely secondary to hypertensive emergency.
Pt was volume overloaded while in the CCU; however, became she became short of breath due to volume overload only once.
Because of her volume overload in the setting of oliguric renal failure, she eventually required dialysis.
She underwent two sessions of dialysis, and subsequently responded to well diuresis with furosemide and metolazone.
Pt was started on daily diuretic therapy since she seemed to consistently develop LE edema & basilar crackles on lung exam when not recieving diuretics.
-Valves: No known dz -Rhythm: no electrical abnormalities.
## Renal: Pt's initial presentation with hypertensive urgency was attributed to re-stenosis of her renal artery stent.
Even after PTCA & re-stenting of the renal artery the pt's BP remained elevated & her renal failure persisted.
Of note, pt's oral clonidine was tapered during the transition to the clonidine patch; however, she should be monitored for rebound hypertension as the taper has just been completed.
Post-renal artery cath, the pt's renal function became progressively worse, peaking at a creatinine of 5.7.
Her acute renal failure was likely multifactorial (hypertensive emergency, dye load, ?
Because of this and the associated signs of volume overload, we started her on daily diuretic therapy.
The urine culture revealed pan-sensitive E. coli.
Repeat urine culture revealed no growth.
There was no evidence of lower extremity cellulitis, though there was concern that with her lower extremity swelling that she might develop this if the skin breaks.
Since she had been requiring an additional 8units of insulin on top of her NPH at 7qAM/7qPM, we increased her NPH to 14 qAM / 7 qPM upon discharge.
## Anemia: Pt's anemia was attributed to her sub-capsular hematoma & also EPO deficiency in the setting of renal failiure.
## LE edema: During hospitalization, pt was noted to have assymetric lower extremity edema (L>R).
There was associated tenderness mild erythema.
She underwent lower extremity ultra-sound which was negative for DVT.
Though she denied being depressed,   she did admit to feeling hopeless & helpless.
## Skin:  Pt was noted to have multiple small stage 1 ulcers on her bottom that were treated with Duo-derm.
Zoloft 25 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO once a day: Watch for signs of suicidality, as this is a new medication for the pt.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2670**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypertensive urgency renal artery instent restenosis renal subcapuslar hematoma CHF Acute on chronic renal insufficiency   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: If pt spikes a fever or if WBC is increasingly elevated, check a U/A and urine culture.
Also, watch for signs of cellulitis as pt's legs have been swollen in setting of volume overload.
-Please contact [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] or return to the ER if the pt develops any of the following symptoms: chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, fever, or decreased urine output.
