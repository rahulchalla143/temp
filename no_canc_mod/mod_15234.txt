Admission Date:  [**2134-1-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-1-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-9-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old man with multiple medical problems including COPD (2L home 02), DM2, GERD, HTN, HLD, CAD s/p NSTEMI [**2126**], recurrent PNA, AAA, recent pneumothorax, CHF (EF=20-25%), AS (valve area of 0.9cm2 and valve gradient of 38) AF on coumadin, who is transferred from [**Hospital1 **] ICU to [**Hospital1 18**] for increasing  pulmonary edema and hypotension.
Admitted with a diagnosis of CHF exacerbation (BNP>500) in the context of likely COPD flare, then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Cardiac cath/TTE showed severe aortic stenosis (valve area of 0.9cm2 and valve gradient of 38).
Cardiac surgery and Pulmonary was consulted to comment on his candidacy for AVR and he was deemed to be a poor open surgical candidate due to his existing comorbidities, but possibly for percutaneous valve replacement in the future.
He was not aggressively diuresed, due to his preload dependence and he was discharged to rehab on his daily 10mg predisone after completing a 7-day taper.
The patient had a previous admission at NWH from [**2040-12-28**] was initially admittted because of severe dywspnea and concerns for an NSTEMI.
His SOB was initally believed to be [**2-17**] COPD flare/pneumonia than CHF.
The patient was given abx for possible pneumonia in the setting of elevated WBC to 26.
Today the patient developed acture respiratory distress that was not responsive to IV lasix 80s or a Lasix gtt; the team felt that his [**Last Name **] problem was likely cardiac and mechanical, he should be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], patient had an a line placed c sbp in the 140/70, noted tachypnia at 33, and face mask o2 at 12 L. HR 114.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes +, Dyslipidemia +, Hypertension + 2.
EF 20-25% -inferior NSTEMI [**2126**] -Severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.9) -CABG: N/A -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: N/A .
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 2L home O2 -Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus -Questionable history of syncope -History of pulmonary embolus in [**2120**] -GERD -left femoral aneurysm repaired [**7-/2133**] [**Hospital1 2025**] -AAA, infrarenal evaluated at 4.5cm on [**2133-7-16**] CT -recurrent pneumonia -lung nodules, stable -large pneumothorax requiring chest tube post-bronch [**2133**]  Social History: The patient is divorced.
He reports rare alcohol use, however, reported daily alcohol use at the age of 20 for approximately ten years   Family History: Mother died age 72 of a "neck spinal cord injury."
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Difficult to ascultate any murmur secondary to heavy breath sounds.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Lungs are diffusely wheezy with crackles at the bases.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES: Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+  Pertinent Results: CXR [**2134-1-11**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-16**]: Extensive opacification in right lower lung probably due to pulmonary edema in the setting of chronic emphysema.
Previous pneumonia in the axillary subsegments of the left upper lobe appears to have improved but there may be bronchietasis in its wake.
No pneumothorax.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
Left PIC line ends in the left brachiocephalic vein and a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
Heterogeneous opacification in the right mid and lower lung zone has improved, probably due to decreasing edema in the setting of severe emphysema, but the asymmetry still raises concern for extensive pneumonia particularly due to aspiration.
Volume loss in the left lower lobe is improving.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed.
No pneumothorax .
Worsening left lower lobe atelectasis and mild interval increase in size of bilateral pleural effusions, small on the right, small-to-moderate on the left.
Resolving right pulmonary heterogenous opacity, either represents pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
CXR [**2134-1-14**] IMPRESSION: Stable left lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
There are unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, left side worse than right.
There is some coarsening of the interstitial markings; however, no overt pulmonary edema is identified.
There is coarsening of the bronchovascular markings which has worsened since previous.
This may represent developing infiltrate or an element of pulmonary edema.
There is unchanged left-sided pleural effusion.
Initial extubation postponed secondary to significant aggitation.
He continued to be aggitated off sedation, olanzapine was traded for haldol around the On [**1-16**] while having CVL replaced and lying flat, developed significant dypsnea and increasing O2 requirement requiring re-intubation.
Repeat CXR consistent with right-sided pleural effusion and increase in pulmonary vascular markings consistent with likely flash pulmonary edema.
# Pump: Initially presented in acute on chronic CHF with likely multifactorial etiology including depressed EF, critical AS, and poor baseline contractility.
# Rhythm:  Presented with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin.
He became persistently tachycardic throughout hospilization, worsening with extubation and fever.
On HD 5, EKG revealed Atrial fibrillation with RVR that was unresponsive to IV metoprolol.
3. levalbuterol HCl 0.31 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) nebulizer Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
7. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) packet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
