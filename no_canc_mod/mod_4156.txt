Admission Date:  [**2166-6-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-6-19**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old white male with a history of coronary artery disease with three-vessel disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure with recent acute renal failure admitted to outside hospital on [**2166-5-29**] with hypoxia.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management of respiratory failure.
In the early even of [**2166-5-29**] at rehabilitation the patient complained of shortness of breath.
He was sent to an outside hospital where he reportedly became unresponsive with oxygen saturations of 80% on 100% face mask.
There was no documented fever.
He was placed on a dopamine drip for hypotension with systolic pressures in the 70s.
On the morning of transfer the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 160s to 170s.
The wife requested transfer to [**Hospital1 188**] where he was recently hospitalized [**2166-4-7**] through [**2166-4-19**] for left hip fracture, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, stent to the right coronary artery, acute renal failure secondary to contrast dye requiring dialysis x 2, and repair of hip fracture with a left open reduction and internal fixation.
Of note, in addition to his respiratory failure he was in diabetic ketoacidosis with a metabolic acidosis.
He had blood loss anemia with an hematocrit of 19 and he was in shock with a picture most consistent with sepsis.
Coronary artery disease status post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction on [**2166-4-7**], catheterization on [**2166-4-9**] with three-vessel disease, stent right coronary artery.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of approximately 25%.
Chronic renal failure with acute renal failure [**4-10**] secondary to catheterization dye load requiring hemodialysis x 2 sessions.
Anemia with decreased hematocrit to 20 with prior hospitalization, source unknown.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Urinary tract infection.
Diabetes mellitus type 2 followed by the [**Hospital **] Clinic.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Amoxicillin ?
Cipro ?
heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 1/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border.
Mild basilar crackles.
Upper extremity edema was noted on hands.
No lower extremity edema.
The patient had a right brachial line with Swan in place, left radial arterial line, no stranding erythema.
He had improved pulmonary edema, no acute cardiopulmonary process noted.
Echocardiogram from [**4-10**] showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, AK anterior septum, anterior free wall, apex, moderate HK inferior septum and lateral free wall.
There was 1+ mitral regurgitation, trace aortic regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Catheterization on [**2166-4-9**] showed three-vessel disease with left anterior descending coronary artery 70% proximal lesion, 100% mid with collaterals from PDA.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, rate 105, prolonged PR, left axis, poor R wave progression, less than [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression noted in the inferior leads.
Respiratory failure:  The patient was admitted to an outside hospital with acute hypoxia, etiology unknown, although aspiration pneumonia presumed, question also of PE given recent surgery, question also of pulmonary edema given history of severe congestive heart failure.
The patient required ventilatory support for several days.
Initial wean was complicated by flash pulmonary edema and agitation requiring reintubation.
Shock:  On admission the patient had a blood pressure of 70s/30s with a temperature of 103 consistent with septic shock.
Mild hypotension persisted until the patient was extubated.
Pneumonia:  The patient was under treatment for pneumonia with Levaquin and questionably vancomycin at the time of hospital transfer.
Both vancomycin and Levaquin were continued for a 14-day course with interval improvement on his chest x-ray and decreased leukocytosis.
While in house a swallow study was done and he was determined to be at a high risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Concurrently the patient experienced a demand ischemia myocardial infarction.
After this event his hematocrit remained stable with intermittent transfusions for iatrogenic blood loss.
Of note the patient had a similar episode of blood loss with his prior hospitalization.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient has severe three-vessel disease status post recent stent x 2 to right coronary artery.
Atrial fibrillation:  Per hospital transfer notes the patient had an initial episode of atrial fibrillation the morning of [**2166-6-3**].
At the time of extubation he was noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation controlled with IV Lopressor.
Acute on chronic renal failure:  At the time of admission the patient had elevated creatinine thought to be due to decreased perfusion from sepsis.
Renal function improved with increased systolic blood pressure and transfusion, however after aggressive diuresis with pulmonary edema, the patient's creatinine worsened.
Diabetes type 2:  The patient has a history of poorly-controlled diabetes.
On admission he was noted to be in diabetic ketoacidosis with a metabolic acidosis.
Throughout the course of his stay he was continued on an insulin drip for close glucose control.
Acute cholecystitis:  While intubated the patient was noted to have increasing alkaline phosphatase with a positive GGT, as well as a sensitive right upper quadrant.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was done which showed thickening of the gallbladder wall as well as a stone in the cystic duct.
He was consulted by both general surgery and interventional radiology who felt that his operative risk was too high given his comorbidities.
He symptomatically improved with a decrease in his alkaline phosphatase.

Diabetes mellitus type 2.
