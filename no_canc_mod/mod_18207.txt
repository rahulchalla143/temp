The infant was delivered by elective cesarean section without labor, for breech presentation.
Examination reveals a well-appearing term infant in no distress.
The anterior fontanelle is soft and flat, facies are non-dysmorphic, palate is intact, neck and mouth are normal, the infant is normocephalic, and there is no nasal flaring.
There are no intercostal retractions and no grunting respirations.
He has good breath sounds bilaterally and no adventitious sounds.
The abdomen is soft and nondistended with no organomegaly and no masses.
Three-vessel umbilical cord is noted.
The infant has an imperforate, but normally placed, anus with superficial dimpling of the skin.
There is no fistula noted.
IMPRESSION:  This term infant presents with imperforate anus, without other clinically evident anomalies.
A CBC and blood culture have been drawn; however, we will defer empirical antibiotic therapy in light of this clinically excellent appearance and absence of peripartum risk factors.
