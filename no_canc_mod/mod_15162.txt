Admission Date:  [**2118-9-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2118-9-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2057-4-30**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MICU [**Location (un) **]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of CAD, hypertension, asthma, transferred from an outside hospital status post anaphylactic shock complicated by cardiac arrest.
The wife [**Name (NI) 653**] a neighbor who found the patient down at approximately 10:20 a.m. and called EMS (question of mechanical failure of EpiPen).
The son assisted with chest compressions.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
The patient is allergic to bees.
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, soft S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
No wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles.
Extremities:  Trace lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Head CT was negative for acute bleed, mass, trauma.
Chest x-ray:  Limited study with no gross pulmonary infiltrates, no overt CHF.
EKG:  Sinus tachycardia at 105 beats per minute with normal axis, QRS 0.088 seconds, PR 0.168 seconds, QTC 0.397 seconds, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V2 through V4 with poor R wave progression.
The Neurology Service was consulted who recommended Ativan and Propofol drip for frequent myoclonic jerks.
No need for Dilantin at this time because it was not felt that these myoclonic jerks were secondary to seizure activity.
It was recognized that the patient had suffered a severe anoxic brain injury, the time down and the presence of myoclonic jerk suggested a poor prognosis.
The patient had a brain MRI on [**2118-9-21**] which showed curvilinear restrictive effusion along gyri of both hemispheres and restricted effusion along the sternal capsules and subinsular region and consistent with diffuse anoxic injury.
Diffuse opacification of paranasal sinuses, vascular patency.
The patient was gradually weaned off the propofol drip with no improvement in neurologic status and the patient ceased withdrawing to pain in the upper extremities.
Given the patient's severe anoxic brain injury the patient's family decided to make him DNR/DNI.
ALLERGY:  The patient was admitted with anaphylactic shock secondary to a bee sting.
Because the patient was initiating his own breaths, a T piece trial was performed in which he had marked increase in his ventilatory rate with a drop in his oxygen saturations.
The ENT Service was consulted with regards to management of his edematous airway.
They recommended that once there was a leak present around the ET tube that the patient be extubated over a bronchoscope to allow for rapid reintubation should it be necessary.
Following extubation, the patient rapidly desaturated and expired secondary to asystolic arrest.
