She had a complication of an anastomotic leak and was reoperated on for a large pelvic abscess.
During that operation, she was given a diverting colostomy and a loop ileostomy, but she had a small bowel injury at that operation which was not successfully repaired.
She had succus draining from her abdominal incision, and she was emergently transferred to our institution for tertiary management.
She was septic and quite sick at that time, and postoperatively developed a cecal to anastomotic and cutaneous fistula with the cecum communicating with her anastomotic site in her pelvis and the incision.
With supportive therapy, her fistula output reduced to almost nothing, and she was evaluated for colostomy takedown.
She periodically had some drainage from her fistula site which indicated a persistent opening.
She underwent a preoperative CT scan with oral contrast which demonstrated no passage of contrast through the fistula, and no clear fistula at the pelvic anastomosis.
There was no sign of obstruction.

Findings (taken from the operative report) were: "Enterocutaneous fistula tract, anastomotic leakage site in the deep pelvis, and dense adhesions from previous surgery."
There were no intraoperative complications, prodecure was well-tolerated by the patient and she was taken to the recovery room (and later that same day to the floor) in stable condition.
Patient received 24 hours of peri-operative vancomycin, gentamicin and flagyl, and her pain was controlled with a dilaudid PCA.
Post-operative pain was a major issue initially and in consultation with APS her PCA dose was increased to 0.5mg and her fentanyl (pre-operative) was re-started with good effect.
[**1-22**] the patient received a picc line and total parenteral nutrition was initiated given her poor pre-operative nutrition and anticipation of several more days NPO.
Her POD2 hematocrit returned at 25.0 (from 33), and given her anemia in the face of hypovolemia the decision was made to transfuse one unit of blood.
She received the transfusion over 4 hours, and later the same evening she became hypoxic with noted erythema of the upper body.
Plain films revealed substantial atelectasis, with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes.
The foley catheter was removed and her diet was slowly advanced given the presence of liquid stool and gas from the ostomy.
She is being discharged home [**2-1**] afebrile, tolerating a full diet and ambulating without difficulty.
