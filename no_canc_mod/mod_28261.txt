He was taken to OR on [**2177-2-1**] for occipital craniotomy for right cerebellar hematoma evacuation with a ventriculostomy placement without intraoperative complications.
Patient transferred back to ICU for hemodynamic and neurologic monitoring.
MRI of the brain showed no infarct besides some compression of the brainstem at the level of the pons, therefore neurology consulted regarding "locked in syndrome".
Neurology team felt that patient demonstrated some elements of locked in syndrome with preserved vertical eye movements and blinking, and comprehension without motor activity.
If the compression of the brain stem is related to cerebral edema there is a chance for him to regain his fucntions as edema resolves.
Neurology recommended a repeat MRI to evaluate cerebral edema on [**2-5**] without significant change in the appearance of edema, no mannitol was given.
[**2177-2-6**] IVC filter palced for DVT prophylaxis since he cannot be anticoagulated and possible prolonged hospitalization/rehabilitation without any complication.
On [**2177-2-8**] patient started spiking fever up to 103 which continued until [**2177-2-18**] without a clear source all of his cultures were negative, HBV/HCV neg, ([**2-8**])CSF negative, except sputum culture grew E COLI.
Patient had bouts of diarrhea requiring rectal bag, cdiff was negative several assays.
On [**2-11**] head CT showed Status post removal of the right-sided ventricular catheter without evidence for hydrocephalus seen.
Resolving right-sided cerebellar and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Persistent low density in the right cerebellar hemisphere, which could either represent a small evolving infarct or residual edema.Suboccipital craniectomy staples removed on [**2177-2-11**].
Patient evaluated by speech pathologist regarding [**Last Name (un) 64943**] muir valve, which was failed this may be due to the trach being too large to get adequate airflow to the vocal cords, &/OR upper airway edema, &/OR impaired vocal cord mobility or closure.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis:  Intraparenchymal cerebellar hemorrhage with incipient herniation.
Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: please seek medical attention if you experience fever > 101.5, severe nausea/vomitting/pain/dizziness; new or increased numbness/tingling/paralysis  please take new medications as directed  please keep foloow-up appointment  please work with physical therapy to improvement range of motion, strength, speech  Followup Instructions: Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3months with Ct call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**] for appt.
