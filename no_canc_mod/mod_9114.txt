Normal regional left ventricular systolic function with mildly increased left ventricular cavity size.
Moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased.
Normal coronary artery origins with no evidence of anomalous coronary arteries, and normal signal characteristics of all visualized vessel segments.
[**2163-9-12**] [**Month/Day/Year 47963**]: The lower lumbar spine as well as the pelvic bones are obscured by retained contrast in the bowel from a prior contrast examination; within these limitations, there is mild lumbar scoliosis convex to the left.
There is no fracture.
CONCLUSION: No bony abnormality or fracture.
[**2163-9-14**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis.
No epidural collection.
At L4/5, there is a disc bulge which contacts and may impinge upon both [**Name (NI) 13032**] nerve roots in the neural foramina.
At L5/S1, there is a central disc extrusion which contacts the right S1 nerve root and compresses the left S1 nerve root in the lateral recesses.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetations is seen on the mitral valve.
The tricuspid valve is normal structurally with trivial regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Due to presence of thickening of valve leaflets and annulus, a focal vegetation or abscess cannot be definitively excluded.
However, there is no substantial change from prior echo on [**2163-8-18**].
No DVT in bilateral lower extremity.
An approximately 2.4-cm fluid collection in the region of the left groin.
No intraluminal thrombus was identified.
Limited interrogation of the left arm AV fistula demonstrates turbulent flow.
There is no fluid collection or abscess surrounding the fistula site.
Persistent left perijugular collateral.
There is prominent gastric distention, of uncertain etiology.
Therefore, there is no evidence of obstruction.
There is no free fluid.
There is no organized fluid collection.
There is no free air.
The lack of intravenous administration limits the evaluation of solid organs.
Allowing for this limitation, there is no gross abnormality associated with the liver, pancreas, adrenals or gallbladder.
As on the previous CT, there are small, subcentimeter abdominal lymph nodes.
At that time, a septated cystic lesion was described.
Internal features were better evaluated with ultrasound, however, there is no gross change in size.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no lytic or sclerotic lesions.
No intra-abdominal abscess.
Finding in the left inguinal canal, which was better evaluated on scrotal ultrasound of [**2163-4-12**].
Small region of non-occlusive thrombus within the right internal jugular vein.
No new thrombus seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 33 yo male with ESRD admitted for uncontrolled acute low back pain, now w/ gram-positive cocci sepsis.
An MRI of the Lumbar spine without contrast was obtained and did not show any evidence of fluid collection or abscess.
A CT of abdomen and pelvis was negative for abscess.
The decision of the team in conjunction with ID was to treat empirically for endocarditis.
There would be no imaging which would reassure enough to treat for shorter duration.
The pt was found to have a RIJ clot on US.
At the time of discharge he remained afebrile and feeling well.
# Hypotension: The pt reports having a low blood pressure at baseline, but then became hypotensive to the 60's systolically on the day of admission following dialysis.
Labetolol was also restarted after the patient was noted to have several measurements in the systolic 140-160s.
# Back pain- The pt presented with low back pain of acute duration.
An MRI without contrast showed disc derangements at L4/L5 and disc extrusion at S1 likely causing nerve root compression.
# Thrombocytopenia: The patient experienced a drop in his platelets, with a nadir of about 50.
The platelets increased up to the 180s and remained stable, he did not show any evidence of active bleeding requiring transfusion.
2. pump- echo in [**7-26**] with global hypokinesis, EF 45% and cath in [**2161**] with evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
Although his repeat TEE was unchanged, it was thought that endocarditis was the most likely cause of his bacteremia and he will be treated with a 6 week course of antibiotics.
He was continued on all of his renal medications, with the dialysis team following.
# Heme: he had a slow trend down in his hematocrit, although his baseline hematocrit ranges from 30-38.
Given his elevated Ferritin, it was thought to be anemia of chronic disease, although difficult to acertain in acute infection.
Pt also reported history of BRBPR secondary to hemorrhoids.
He was placed on a bowel regimen with cortisone cream to try and prevent exacerbation of hemorrhoids.
He also had evidence of a RIJ clot on US and was on a heparin drip.
A repeat US showed persistent nonocclusive clot in the right IJ.
Hydrocortisone Acetate 1 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Rectal [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for hemorrhoids.
