HISTORY:  This is a 36-1/7 week gestational age baby girl, now day of life six, readmitted from home for hypothermia and jaundice.
Pregnancy history:  Estimated due date was [**2136-12-31**], for an estimated gestational age of 36-1/7 weeks on the day of delivery [**2136-12-4**].
The baby was induced for worsening preeclampsia and progressed to a vacuum assisted vaginal delivery.
There was no maternal fever or signs of chorioamnionitis.
The infant has otherwise been alert, waking for feeds and asymptomatic.
In the pediatrician's office on the day of readmission, the rectal temperature was noted to be 96.0 F., and the baby was referred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of hypothermia and hyperbilirubinemia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission showed a well appearing infant in no distress.
Admission temperature at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit was 98.2 F., with heart rate 128; respiratory rate 36; blood pressure 68/35 with a mean arterial pressure of 43.
HEENT examination was notable for anterior fontanel which was open, soft and flat, nondysmorphic facies, intact palate, no flaring, mucous membranes were moist.
The chest examination showed no retractions with good breath sounds bilaterally.
Abdominal examination showed soft and nondistended abdomen with no organomegaly, no masses, active bowel sounds, anus patent.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Impression is that this is a 36 week gestational infant now day of life six with borderline hypothermia likely secondary to thermal regulatory immaturity and relatively small size.
The hyperbilirubinemia has been noted at the pediatrician's office.
Although there is an Rh incompatibility, antibody screens on mother and baby have been negative.
The etiology is likely physiologic, possibly compounded by mild dehydration with a 9% weight loss during breast feeding.
The baby is admitted with hypothermia and hyperbilirubinemia for sepsis rule out.
Initially, the baby girl was maintained in an [**Name (NI) 54326**] for the reported hypothermia, however, at 03:00 a.m. on [**12-11**], she was placed in an open crib and has maintained temperatures adequately without additional assistance.
No active issues.
CONDITION AT TRANSFER:  The baby is stable for transfer for continued temperature and hyperbilirubinemia monitoring in the Well Baby Nursery.
Continue to follow blood cultures while off of antibiotics.
Hyperbilirubinemia, stable, without need for phototherapy.
