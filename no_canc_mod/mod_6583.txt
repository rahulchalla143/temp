Admission Date:  [**2118-9-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-9-7**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath for 1 night, productive cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 28030**] is an 86 year-old man with a history of non-ischemic CM (EF 30-35%), hx PAF on coumadin and s/p recent successful cardioversion [**8-28**] followed by initiation of amiodarone, and a history of difficult to control volume status secondary to dietary indiscretion.
He is now presenting with respiratory distress for one day and found to be in atrial fibrillation.
Over the past few days he has had increased productive cough of brownish sputum, however, he does mention having this productive cough at baseline.
He has not noticed any fevers or chills at home.
Otherwise he denies any chest pain or palpitations.
Exam was notable for bibasilar crackles and irregularly irregular HR.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes.
CXR showed evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion and ?
On review of systems, he does have a history of pulmonary embolism and is currently anticoagulated.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain.
He does have dyspnea on exertion.
No palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS:  + Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, - Hypertension 2.
Mild two vessel coronary artery disease.
Mild left ventricular diastolic and focal systolic dysfunction.
JNC VI Stage 2 hypertension -PACING/ICD:  none - chronic systolic CHF - EF 30-35% on [**2118-6-27**] echo -mild diastolic HF per [**2109**] cath - paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, s/p cardioversion [**2118-8-27**] followed by initiation of amiodarone .
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Rheumatoid Arthritis - HTN - ?
COPD - HL - DM2 - PE [**6-28**] found to have multiple sub-segmental PEs, anticoagulated since  Social History: Jehovah's witness.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: 1+ edema of ankles and shins, 1+ distal pulses, no  calf tenderness.
CXR [**9-4**]: UPRIGHT AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: There is increased opacity in the right lower lobe.
There is moderate cardiomegaly, stable.
Backrgound prominence of interstitial markings, consistent with known interstial disease seen on prior CT is noted, ([**2118-7-17**]).
Aortic arch calcifications are noted.
There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema with more confluent right lower lung opacity, concomitant infection in this region cannot be excluded.
CXR [**9-5**]: FINDINGS: Since [**2118-9-4**], increased opacification of the anterior segment of the right upper lobe and of the right lower lobe, consistent with pneumonia or less likely asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Unchanged cardiomegaly and cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature.
There is no pleural effusion, and there is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Increasing lung opacity consistent with pneumonia, less likely asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Unchanged cardiomegaly and pulmonary venous hypertension.
EKG [**9-4**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Delayed precordial R wave transition.
Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave changes.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 86 yo man with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p successful cardioversion [**8-28**] presenting with an acute exacerbation of chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure and found to again be in atrial fibrillation.
# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure:  EF 30-35% on echo [**6-28**].
Given exam, elevated BNP, CXR, most likely etiology of hypoxia is volume overload.
Precipitant seems to be a combination of dietary indiscretion, failure to adjust his home furosemide dosing based on his daily weights, and poorly tolerating atrial fibrillation.
No clear evidence of infection.
No evidence of ischemia on EKG.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  He is currently back in atrial fibrillation, s/p recent cardioversion [**2118-8-23**].
Currently, no evidence of active ischemia.
This is probably secondary to poor forward flow from being fluid overloaded.
Likely secondary to hypoxia vs cardiac hepatopathy.
RLL consolidation:  Most likely represents assymetric volume overload as it improved dramtically on follow-up CXR after diuresis.
He did not appear to be infected clinically.
Metformin was held in the setting of ARF and lactic acidosis, glyburide was also held.
# hx PE:  given subsegemental nature, plan was to continue anticoagulation for 3 months, but he will benefit from long term anticoagulation for his PAF anyway and has tolerated the medication well.
# Lung nodules/possible ILD/possible COPD: Had small amounts of reddish brown sputum production consistent with hemoptysis.
Multiple pulmonary nodules and mediastinal LAD on CT [**7-17**] concerning for infection vs neoplasm.
Interlobular thickening seen on CT [**7-17**] concerning for ILD (has risk factors including RA, hx coal dust and possible asbestos exposure, tobacco).
He is a Jehovah's witness and will not accept blood products.
VNA was refused at discharge but as pt is independent, is able to care for himself at home.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check chem-7, Digoxin level and INR on [**2118-9-13**] and call results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7728**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Hemoptysis Dyslipidemia Acute Renal Failure Diabetes Mellitus Type 2   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with congestive heart failure that we think was due to your high sodium diet and your rapid heart rate.
Call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you have any trouble breathing, increasing cough, swelling in the legs or trouble lying flat to sleep.
Also call for fevers, chest pain, vomiting or any other unusual symptoms.
