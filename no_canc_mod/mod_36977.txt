seizure, delta MS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture [**7-11**] and [**7-3**]   History of Present Illness: 47 year old female with Hep C cirrhosis, HIV ([**5-27**] CD4 >1000, VL>916,000), Type II DM, and recently diagnosed chronic renal failure presents following possible seizure.
She was also complaining of a mild frontal headache, relieved with ibuprofen.
No known fevers, chills, URI symptoms, abdominal or urinary symptoms.
Given shallow breathing and diminished gag, she was intubated for airway protection.
The patient was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 44757**] after she presented with decreased UOP, increased LE edema, and increased abdominal girth and was found to be in subacute renal failure (BUN 64/5.1).
Exam/laboratory studies were c/w nephrotic syndrome, and a renal U/S showed lg echogenic kidneys with nl perfusion.
Initially, her symptoms were fel to be c/w HIV-associated nephropathy.
Renal bx [**6-27**] was c/w diabetic nephropathy +/- IgA nephropathy.
Past Medical History: 1) HIV diagnosed [**2099**]: off HAART since [**6-25**]; [**5-27**] CD4 1065 2) Hepatitis C: genotype 1; [**8-23**] liver bx c/w stage IV fibrosis; s/p IFN and ribaviran [**Date range (1) 108215**], stopped secondary to neutropenia - [**3-27**] EGD grade I varices at GE jxn, portal HTN gastropathy 3) Type II DM: HgbA1C [**3-26**] 5.4 4) Asthma 5) Glaucoma 6) h/o pancreatitis 7) h/o EtOH abuse   Social History: No current smoking, alcohol, no drug use.The patient has a prior history of heavy alcohol use and has not drank in over a  year.
Physical Exam: Tc 99.8, HR 92, bp 175/87, resp 18, 100% AC TV 500, RR 16, FiO2 0.6 PEEP 5; ABG 7.41/32/223 Gen: middle-aged African Amirican female, intubated, sedated, not responsive to verbal or tactile stimulus.
HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, nl conjunctiva, OMMM, OGT in place, ETT in place, neck supple, no LAD, no JVD Cardiac: RRR, no M/R/G appreciated Pulm: Scatterred ronchi throughout, minimal crackles at bases bilaterally Abd: NABS, soft, NT, mildly distended Ext: 2+ LE edema to knees bilaterally, extremities warm with 1+ DP bilaterally Skin: scatterred petechiae over lower extremities bilaterally Neuro: Moves all 4 extremities in response to noxious stimuli, brisk DTR throughout, toes downgoing bilaterally, normal tone.
Probable left atrial abnormality.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2114-6-20**] sinus tachycardia and left atrial abnormality are new.
[**2114-7-2**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Multiple lesions with high T2 signal in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally, which appear nonspecific but may represent infection, chronic microvascular ischemia, or demyelinating disease.
CXR [**2114-7-9**] Improved consolidation with residual consolidation in the posterior basilar segment of the right lower lobe.
[**2114-7-9**] CT HEAD There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
There are new small bilateral low density fluid collections over the frontal convexities.
No findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis on ultrasound.
Questionable subcentimeter area of focal thickening in relation to the anterior gallbladder wall, which could be followed up at interval with focused ultrasound.
No intra-abdominal ascites for paracentesis.
CSF [**2114-7-11**] NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
EEG [**2114-7-10**] This is an abnormal routine EEG obtained in stage II sleep progressing to stage III sleep with brief periods of wakefulness due to the presence of sharp and spikes bifrontally, left more than right.
In addition, the patient is excessively drowsy and sleepy.
This finding could either be due to a previous sleep deprivation or could be a medication overdose effect.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 y/o AAF with PMH significant for HIV, Hepatitis C, cirrhosis, Type II DM, HTN, and most recent hospitalization for subacute renal failure (DM nephropathy +/- IgA Nephropathy), presents with altered mental status.
Mental status changes While her initial mental status changes were thought to be due to hypoglycemia (glucose on admission was 36), the differential regarding this remains broad.
She was also found to have aspiration pneumonia, which also may have aggrevated her mental status.
Hepatic encephalopathy is still a possibility, with her elevated ammonia (84 umol/L), but was not encephalopathic during previous hospital stay and did not receive lactulose at that time; she received lactulose throughout this admission.
Similarly, uremic encephalopathy was also considered although her BUN today was 70, and at prior admission, she was not encephalopathic though in ARF with elevated BUN/Cr.
The time frame was off given her stay in the MICU for delerium tremens, and her symptoms were not consistent with this.
Finally, an HTLV1/2 was found to be negative, suggesting her high CD4 count of >1000 did represent true immunocompentency, as HTLV1/2 infection can give a false impression of a high CD4 count.
Two LPs failed to reveal a cause for her change in MS, such as active meningitis, thus nondiagnostic.
Hypovolemic hypernatremia Over the course of her admission, the patient had a gradually rising sodium, which peaked at 151 on [**7-10**].
?holosystolic/?outflow tract heart murmur When the patient was hypovolemic, she was found to have a systolic murmur, heard best in the L upper sternal border.
Prior echo ([**7-2**]) and repeat echo ([**7-9**]) revealed no valvular abnormalities, no vegetations.
She was extubated after her MRI but then became hypercarbic likely secondary to volume overload.
Upon transfer from the ICU, she continued to be stable on room air but was running a low grade fever and did have a chest Xray consistent with RLL aspiration pneumonia with possible LUL pneumonia.
Given her mental status changes, she was switched from levofloxacin to clindamycin for the final two days of her course.
At discharge, she was afebrile and her lung exam was clear to ascultation.
Possible seizure: The patient's initial presentation on admission was consistent with a seizure (lateral eye deviation, stool/urine incontinence).
The differential diagnosis considered in a patient with HIV, HepC, Cirrhosis and DM2 was broad and included hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy, HIV-associated encephalopathy (20% of HIV encephalopathy is first presentation of symptomatic disease), toxins, withdrawal (given her polysubstance abuse), malignancy (lymphoma or primary or secondary tumor) vasculitidites (mixed cryos, microscopic polyarteritis, primary CNS vasculitis), hemmorhagic stroke, or OI with HIV (including toxo, crypto, TB, listeria, PML).
Her MRI/MRA showed an increase in T2 signal in periventricular and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.
These findings were nonspecific but consistent with infection, chronic microvascular disease, or demyelinating disease.
Alcohol withdrawal may have also precipitated the initial event or the hypoglycemia, but was considered less likely given her recent [**Hospital 47424**] hospital stay.
Hepatic or uremic encephalopathy are still possibilities (given MRI findings) but may be contributing to her ongoing mental status changes more than precipitating her acute event.
The MRI showed no mass effect or bleed, ruling out tumor or hemmorhagic stroke.
An EEG during admission was consistent with no epileptiform activity.
Two LPs, on [**7-3**] and [**7-11**], were negative for polys and microorganisms on gram stain.
6. hip/flank pain Most likely secondary to hematoma following renal biopsy, visualized on abdominal CT ([**7-6**]) as 2.7 by 4.8 cm lesion.
Per ID's recommendation, a unilateral hip x-ray was conducted on [**7-10**] and showed no evidence of osteomyeolitis.
Leukocytosis The patient was started on Levofloxacin/Flagyl on [**7-5**] for RLL infiltrate seen on CXR and increasing WBC (see above).
Renal failure Recent progression of Cr from 1 [**12-27**] to 5 [**5-27**] with evidence of nephrotic syndrome.
Pathology from renal biopsy consistent with diabetic nephropathy and possibly IgA nephropathy.
Hypertension The patient's hypertension was well-controlled over admission.
Non-AG metabolic acidosis Etiologies include diarrhea, type I or Type IV RTA (given positive UAG), renal failure.
The patient's acidosis was stable over the course of this and last admission.
Diarrhea C. diff negative, judged likely related to HIV .
Anemia During her last admission, the patient's anemia and iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Thrombocytopenia Over course of prior admission found to be TTP/HUS negative.
Most likely secondary to liver disease.
Hep C cirrhosis Her ammonia level was found to be 84 on [**7-2**] but fell to 40 on [**7-11**].
Hepatic encephalopathy may have been contributing to patient's change in mental status, however she was not receiving lactulose during her entire previous admission, and was NOT encephalopathic therefore unlikely casue of her delta ms. .
