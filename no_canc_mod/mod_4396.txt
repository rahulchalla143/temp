Superior anterior endplate compression fracture of L1 is of indeterminate age but new from [**2121-10-24**].
There is evidence of a healed fracture of the right lateral fifth rib.
No other fractures are identified.
No definite evidence of intra-abdominal trauma.
Thickening of the esophageal wall is noted without evidence of rupture.
Thickening of the wall of the second and third portions of the duodenum with mild adjacent stranding, concerning for duodenitis which may be infectious, inflammatory or although post-traumatic cause can not be entirely excluded in the setting of trauma.
Multinodular thyroid gland is incidentally noted.
ecg: Sinus tachycardia with minor non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Otherwise, there is no significant change.
EGD: Abnormal mucosa in the esophagus (biopsy) Erythema, congestion and granularity in the duodenal bulb Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
MRSA NASAL SWAB POSITIVE, NO OTHER MICRO DATA .
hepatitis serologies pending  Brief Hospital Course: 57F with a history of hypertension, pancreatitis, steatohepatitis, and GERD who presented with 5 days of nausea and vomiting in the setting of poor nutrition and excess alcohol consumption.
Found to have a marked metabolic acidosis initially requiring admission to the MICU.
EGD was notable for esophagitis and duodenitis.
She presented in acute renal failure which resolved with admisistration of IVF and was attributed to hypovolemia.
Her Anion-gap (positive ketones) metabolic acidosis was attributed to starvation and alcoholic ketoacidosis--this also resolved promptly with IVF.
She did have some sick contacts, so her nausea and vomitting could have been secondary to viral gastroenteritis, but more likely they were a consequence of her acidosis or esophagitis/duodenitis.
She received thiamine and folate repleteion for her history of alcoholism and poor nutrtion.
She did not diplay nay signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal during this admission.
Her fibrate was held during the admission and at the time of discharge because of her resolving transaminitis.
Several incidental findings were noted on a CT of the torso that will require oupatient follow-up: 1. a superior anterior endplate compression fracture: She will need outpt bone denisometry as this is suspicious for osteoporosis.
