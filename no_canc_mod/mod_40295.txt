Admission Date:  [**2176-10-14**]              [**Month/Day/Year **] Date:   [**2176-10-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2140-9-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim DS  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 983**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status, leg pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 36yo male w/ h/o depression, substance abuse and diabetes found hypotensive and altered this morning by his family.
He went downstairs to his basement apartment until this morning, when he walked up the stairs and complained of right leg pain, difficulty voiding and difficulty hearing.
He has had trouble voiding in the past, but a work-up including cystoscopy was negative.
He had had a productive cough for the last 2 weeks.
He had a voluntary weight loss of 60 lbs over the last several months through dieting and exercise.
He had a history of severe depression and oxycontin abuse, and had recently been very depressed, but had not told his [**First Name3 (LF) **] of plans for suicide.
He was complaining of pain in his right thigh and hearing loss.
CXR showed diffuse bilateral opacities.
Patient had a R IJ CVL placed and was started on Levophed.
Bedside ultrasound showed poor cardiac squeeze, but no pericardial effusion and a negative FAST.
Serum tox negative, urine tox positive for cocaine and opiates, but negative for benzos and amphetamines.
- Tobacco: none - Alcohol: none, per family - Illicits: long history of oxycontin use.
Family History: family history of diabetes and coronary artery disease.
CV: Hyperdynamic, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Obese, soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley in place.
Otherwise warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: Moving all extremities, following basic commands.
Neck: supple, no JVP elevation appreciated, no LAD Lungs: CTAB, good aeration, no accessory muscle use CV: regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Obese, soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, nontender, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly  Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis.
talking & interacting appropriately.
No significant valvular disease seen.
Normal estimated intracardiac filling pressures with high cardiac output.
CT head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Fluid within the sinuses as above, most likely due to intubation.
Renal ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of renal obstruction.
After that improved with no intervention other than diuresis, he was discharged in stable condition to a shelter for help with his polysubstance dependency issues.
# Altered mental status: Most likely secondary to an ingestion.
Other possibilities would be sepsis, post-ictal phase, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, hepatic or renal encephalopathy.
Patient MS continued to improve but in setting of worsening renal failure, patient carefully monitered for uremic encephalopathy.
# Hypotension/hypothermia: Differential originally included drug overdose, hypovolemia and overwhelming infection.
Patient had no source of infection as CXR and lung exam clear, UA negative, no abdominal pain therefore antbiotics were withheld.
Per toxicology, differential of ingestion in setting of initial bradycardia includes calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and digoxin.
Patient had no change in blood sugars and his digoxin level was negative.
# Transaminitis: Most likely due such as Tylenol vs shock liver.
Believe that LFTs could have been elevated with acute tylenol overdose but hypoperfusion is more likely especially as patient has signs of hypoperfusion with his kidneys with evidence of ATN.
At time of [**Location **] his LFTs had normalized, his INR was baseline and he did not require further checks of his LFTs.
Patient continued to have downtrending CK with eventual DC of fluids especially in the setting of worsening renal failure.
# Acute renal failure: Likely a combination of hypovolemia (hypoperfusion) and rhabdomyolysis.
Patient aggressively fluid resuscitated as above, with down trending CK.
Urinalysis showed evidence of muddy brown casts consistent with ATN, most likely due to hypoperfusion.
Renal ultrasound was negative for any other acute process.
Patient was hypervolemic on examination and per renal given large dose lasix to try to improve kidney function.
Patient was monitered for signs of uremic encephalopathy.
Patient also had increasing anion gap most likely due to uremia.
# Elevated lipase: Likely from hypotension, never c/o abdominal pain.
Lipase trended down with fluid resuscitation.
# Elevated troponin: Likely from overall hypoperfusion.
Enzymes were trended and came down without EKG changes.
# Depression/substance abuse: Patient has hx of severe depression.
Per family, patient's depression has been getting more severe and in turn his drug abuse more frequent.
Acute Renal Failure Secondary: 1.
You also had severe kidney failure and the kidney team followed you closely.
Your white blood cell count was high, but we found no sources of infection and you had no fevers.
