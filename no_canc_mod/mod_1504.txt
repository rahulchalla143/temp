Neck pain started on [**2-7**] and is described as spasms L>R.
She initially attributed pain to sleeping position and took flexeril with minimal relief.
Pain persisted and was associated with increased fatigue, decreased appetite and PO intake.
2 days PTA, she noted progressive lightheadedness, dizziness and fatigue as well as subjective fevers and night sweats.
On day of transfer, she felt so weak she was unabel to stand, was concerned she was going to pass out and had weakness in her hands bilaterally.
Denies headache, photophobia, dysuria, sick contacts, cough, sore throat, abdominal pain, sinus pain or congestion, or recent travel.
She looked well but had asympomtatic hypotension with SBP in 60s-80s so received 6L [**Month/Year (2) 10899**] at OSH and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
MRI also performed which was limited but revealed prevertebral edema C2-C6.
Neuro exam normal except for mild weakness triceps B/L.
Neck pain currently 0/10.

Persistently low BP's after fluid resuscitation.
Prevertebral edema C2-C6.
Although some of changes might be degenerative cannot exclude C5-C6 discitis osteomyelitis complex at level C5-C6; however very subotimal scan due to motion and most of post-contrast sequences are non-diagnostic.
Final Report CERVICAL SPINE MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [**2131-2-13**]  INDICATION: 52-year-old woman with fever and neck pain for four days.
Persistently low blood pressure after fluid resuscitation.
STIR images demonstrate abnormal high signal in the C5-6 intervertebral disc, and in the marrow of the C5 and C6 vertebral bodies.
There is a large prevertebral collection from C2 through C6, with prevertebral edema extending inferiorly to T1.
This collection demonstrates high signal on T2-weighted images and intermediate signal on pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images, more consistent with a phlegmon than an abscess.
There is an anterior epidural collection from C4 through C6, which enhances on post-contrast images, consistent with a phlegmon.
This collection moderately narrows the spinal canal and deforms the spinal cord.
There is also a small left posterior epidural rim-enhancing fluid collection at C7-T1 (series 13, image 6, and series 14, image 27) consistent with an abscess, which also moderately narrows the spinal canal and deforms the left posterolateral spinal cord.
There is edema in the interspinous ligaments from C3-4 through C6-7, as well as edema in the posterior subcutaneous soft tissues.
Multilevel degenerative changes are present, but are suboptimally assessed due to motion artifacts.
Findings consistent with discitis and osteomyelitis at C5-6.
Anterior epidural phlegmon from C4 through C6, moderately narrowing the spinal canal and deforming the spinal cord.
Small left posterior epidural abscess at C7-T1, moderately narrowing the spinal canal and deforming the spinal cord.
Large prevertebral collection from C2 through C6, more consistent with a phlegmon than an abscess.

A residual fluid collection anterior to the spine at the C5-6 level most likely represents a postoperative seroma, recommend attention on followup.
Moderate-sized intracanalicular, epidural collection, which is intermediate in signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted imaging, and shows peripheral enhancement with central low signal on T1-weighted post-contrast images, results in moderate canal narrowing and in this setting is concerning for infectious phlegmon/early abscess.
Heterogeneous marrow with numerous foci of T1/T2 hyperintensity without abnormally high signal on STIR or post-contrast images most likely represent hemangiomas as well as reconversion of red marrow in the setting of patient's known anemia.
Final Report CLINICAL INFORMATION: 52-year-old female who presented with an epidural abscess and is status post C5-6 corpectomy and anterior reconstruction.
A residual fluid collection is seen anterior to the spine extending from the midline rightward and measuring 3.0 x 2.2 x 0.9 cm.
More widespread edema and induration in this area is likely post-operative.
Posterior to the thecal sac is a dorsal epidural space collection which is intermediate in T2 signal and low in T1 signal which extends from the C3-4 disc space to the upper T2 vertebral body level, measuring 10 cm (CC) and producing moderate narrowing of the central canal (3;8, 6;20).
The cervical spinal cord and the cranio-cervical junction are unremarkable in appearance.
THORACOLUMBAR SPINE: The visualized spinal cord and conus medullaris are normal in appearance and terminate normally at the L1 vertebral body level.
There is no significant disc degenerative disease or neural foraminal narrowing.
Vertebral body disc height and alignment is preserved.
Edema seen in the posterior lumbar soft tissues is likely related to the patient's recent debilitated state.
The bone marrow is diffusely heterogeneous with scattered T1-/T2-hyperintense foci, likely representing hemangiomas (or "fatty rests"), the largest of which within the T5 vertebral body, abutting the superior endplate, measures approximately 1 cm.
Throughout the spine, these foci demonstrate no increased and predominantly decreased STIR-signal and no abnormal enhancement, consistent with their non-aggressive nature.
Moderate-sized dorsal epidural collection, which shows peripheral enhancement with central low-signal on T1-weighted post-contrast images, results in moderate canal narrowing; in this setting, this finding likely represents persistent infectious phlegmon/abscess.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] with neck pain and fever.
MRI was concerning for cervical epidural abscess and the patient was taken to the OR for anterior C5-6 corpectomy / cage / fusion on [**2131-2-13**] and C6-T1 lami / C4-T2 PSF with ICBG on [**2131-2-14**] without complication.
TEDs / pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.
An echo performed [**2131-2-15**] revealed no evidence of vegetation.
The patient's pain was controlled with IV pain medications followed by oral analgesics once tolerating POs.
On the day of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.

If the incision is draining cover it with a new sterile dressing.
If the incision starts draining at anytime after surgery, do not get the incision wet.
If you have an incision on your hip please follow the same instructions in terms of wound care.
