Admission Date:  [**2194-4-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-11-24**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**] Chief Complaint: Upper airway abnormalities, respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Intubation and extubation PICC line insertion Rigid Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: 84 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and recent admission for cellulitis, who initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2194-4-16**] with generalized weakness, difficulty walking, and 2 falls.
Pulmonary was consulted and found that the patient had arytenoid joint dislocations, subglottic stenosis, and tracheobronchomalacia.
Exam was notable for fever to 102.2, tachycardia, lower extremity cellulitis, symmetric weakness.
On [**2194-4-17**], he developed a sore throat and was noted to have pustules in his posterior oropharynx with surrounding erythema.
He was seen by ID who was concerned about a drug reaction to Bactrim versus a viral process, although this would not explain the patient's bandemia.
On the afternoon of [**4-19**], the patient developed wheezing, respiratory distress.
He was noted to have some swelling in the upper airway.
He was treated for heart failure with Lasix 40 mg IV and 2 inches of nitro paste, followed by nitro gtt.
This showed edema distal to the cords.
Bronchoscopy showed arytenoid joint dislocations, subglottic stenosis, and tracheobronchomalacia.
The patient's oropharynx showed increased pustules around the posterior pharynx as well as underneath the tongue and buccal mucosa.
Of note, the patient had troponin elevations to 2.64, which had trended down to 0.89 by the time of discharge.

There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Limited evaluation of mucosal surfaces due to copious secretions around the ET tube.
Dependent atelectasis and possible bilateral pleural effusions in the imaged upper lungs.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine including mild spinal canal narrowing at C5-6 secondary to a posterior disc osteophyte complex.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrates severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Limited resting hemodynamicsdemonstrate elevated systemic blood pressure.
CT HEAD [**2194-5-2**] FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, major vascular territorial infarction, mass effect or edema.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity is compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Age-appropriate prominence of ventricles and sulci is compatible with diffuse parenchymal volume loss.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
No suspicious osseous lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
Atelectatic changes are again seen at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic angle suggesting small pleural effusion.
Continued atelectatic changes at the left base.
EKG [**2194-4-22**] Sinus bradycardia - the first beat of the tracing is of uncertain mechanism.
Intra-atrial conduction delay.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Delayed R wave progression is non-diagnostic but cannot exclude possible septal myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities with prolonged QTc interval - cannot exclude ischemia.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Anterior T wave inversions raising consideration of myocardial ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2194-5-2**] no significant change.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2194-4-29**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
The patient was transferred to our MICU team with the two most active issues as respiratory abnormalities and h/o respiratory failure at OSH, as well as EKG changes and cardiac enzymes concerning for NSTEMI.
After extubation, the patient continued to be altered in MS.  Neurology was consulted both for the pt's weakness as well as AMS.
After transfer to the medical floor, the patient was stable and continued to improve in terms of mental status.
He was eventually transferred to a rehab facility for further strength conditioning as well as clearing of his MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] did have a persistent leukocytosis which was downtrending at time of discharge and an eosinophilia which was stable.
We ruled out all other infectious etiologies, and the patient did not have any focal findings to indicate an infection.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM # Coronary artery disease/NSTEMI: EKG changes/enzyme elevations concerning for ischemia versus strain.
Echo revealed EF 50-55% and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid septal hypokinesis.
# Upper airways abnormalities: Bronchoscopy [**2194-4-20**] showed arytenoid joint dislocation, subglottic stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia extending to the BIM at the OSH.
Etiology possibly infectious vs traumatic and possibly [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] reaction.
Notably, it is unclear as to the cause of his upper airway abnormality, and would wonder if PNA from klebsiella was the cause vs. an allergic reaction to bactrim as previously documented in OSH notes.
We discontinued his bumex and he did not show any overt si/sxs of heart failure or volume overload.
# Respiratory failure: As above, etiology upper airway edema versus cardiogenic pulm edema versus post-obstructive pulm edema [**1-1**] PNA vs allergic reaction to medication.
Respiratory cultures were obtained from OSH that showed Klebsiella and his zosyn (that was started at the OSH) was changed to ctx.
Patient had ongoing secretions, fever and leukocytosis that were concerning.
Diureses was initiated with improvement of pulmonary edema.
# Delirium: Neuro c/s is currently following, and most likely cause is delirium in the setting of prolonged hospitalization with multiple interventions.
Given leukocytosis (see below), there was concern for infx, and as such UTI and kleb PNA was treated with 2nd course of CTX.
His status is very c/w delirium given the waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] that happens, and notably he does seem more interactive when family is around.
# HTN: After cath patient had HTN urgency with BPs to the 200s systolic.
Ultimately, the patient was started on metoprolol and captopril, both of which had to be uptitrated after extubation for hypertensive.
# UTI: Pt noted to have an infectious UA with a negative UCx.
Of note, the patient was afebrile during her time on the medical floor.
# Eosinophilia: Pt noted to have eosinophilia after being admitted here (admitted with normal Eos).
Also thought about possible allergic rxn to medications, and nonessential meds were d/c'ed (most notably pantoprazole).
# Volume overload: Pt was noted to be 4L positive LOS while in the ICU.
Diureses with lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] was initiated to help with vent weaning which showed improvement of pulmonary edema.
After transfer to the medical floor, all diuretics were held as the patient did not seem to be volume overloaded, and his respiratory status remained stable.
# QT prolongation: Likely with bradycardia, aggressively replete K, Mg.
# Fever/bandemia: Improved.
[**Name2 (NI) 103808**] v pneumonia v pharyngitis.
Cultures revealed Klebsiella in sputum so likely a pneumonia.
Upon transfer to the medical floor, he remained afebrile, however had a persistent leukocytosis (see below).
We did a thorough w/u of further infection, and the patient was treated with another round of CTX x 8 days given UTI and persistent scant kleb on sputum cx.
# Leukocytosis: The patient was noted to have a leukocytosis that peaked ~16, and downtrended to 14 and stayed stable x 3 days.
A thorough evaluation was done for infection (blood Cx, Urine Cx, LFTs, CXR, skin evaluation) which was all negative.
# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine 2.0 on presntation to OSH with lytes c/w pre-renal picture.
Did receive some IVF when some prerenal component.
# LFT elevations: OSH RUQ U/S with multiple tiny gallstones vs. echogenic sludge.
# Hyperlipidemia: started atorvastatin given concern for ACS.
# Intertrigo: Pt started on miconazole powder here prn for the intertrigo.
# FOLLOW UP ISSUES - Will defer decision to restart diuretics to the outpatient setting - Further titration of BP medication (increase in metop if necessary, or switch to labetalol, or perhaps start of other medication) - Would consider further w/u of persistent leukocytosis and eosinophilia - Patient will need encouragement for PO intake to improve hydration and volume status.
