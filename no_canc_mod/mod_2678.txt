Admission Date:  [**2101-12-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-1-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2024-11-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: GI Bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: 76 yo female with Diastolic CHF (EF of 60%), SLE, ESRD on HD, diverticulosis, CAD on plavix/ASA, known colovaginal fistula, presents with bright red blood per vagina mixed with feces starting 9AM this morning while going to the bathroom.
Pt has had h/o vaginal bleeding previously, but never to this extent.
She also has a long history of urosepsis [**2-22**] stool output from vagina, most recently in [**2-/2101**] per [**Hospital1 18**] records.
Past Medical History: Diastolic CHF (ECHO [**2098**]: LVEF 60%) SLE w/ chronic renal insufficiency [**2-22**] focal sclerosis (baseline Cr 2.5-3.0) CKD on HD (on Aranesp?)
Atrial fibrillation off coumadin HTN CAD s/p CABG ([**2093**]) on plavix Hyperlipidemia Gout Mod-Sev MR h/o diverticulitis Rectovaginal Fistula Osteoporosis h/o esophagitis h/o aspiration pneumonia s/p cholecystectomy  Social History: Cantonese speaking only.
Oozing bright red blood from vagina, no masses or packing on digital vaginal exam.
No definite evidence for active extravasation in the region of the known colovaginal fistula.
Saccular infrarenal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 3 cm in diameter is stable in size.
Extensive diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.
Atrophic kidneys with multiple cysts bilaterally consistent with history of end-stage renal disease.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
An echodensity associated with the anterior mitral leaflet, on its atrial aspect is seen, most likely representing an acoustic artifact, but a vegetation cannot be excluded with certainty.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Echo [**1-2**]: Thickened mitral leaflets with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, but no discrete vegetation.
Mild aortic regurgitation without discrete vegetation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
US AV graft [**1-2**]: IMPRESSION: No fluid collection or evidence of abscess is seen at the site of the patient's left arm AV fistula.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo F with lupus nephritis, CKD on HD, CAD s/p CABG, HTN, rectro-vag fistula who presented to the ER with likely GI bleeding of diverticular source admitted to the MICU for GI bleed, hypotension and respiratory failure.
The patient has had h/o vaginal bleeding previously, but never to this extent.
She also has a long history of urosepsis [**2-22**] stool output from vagina from a known rectal vaginal fistula.
The likely source of the bleeding was deemed to be from a diverticular bleed that was near the fistular opening.
Patient had no further bleeding after first night of admission and hematocrit was stable, but was critically ill throughout her stay so no surgical intervention or workup of the fistula was pursued.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: In the ER she received 1.7L of fluid for hypotension and shortly thereafter the patient developed acute pulmonary edema and tachypnea.
She received Bipap, nitro SL, and nitro gtt with no improvement.
She was sent to the MICU for management of her respiratory failure.
Thoughts for her hypoxic respiratory failure included infection, hypervolemia, CHF exacerbation.
Less likely TRALI or ARDS following blood transfusion since per ED report pt had received fluids prior to intubation.
# Septic Shock: On [**12-29**], pt had positive blood cultures that was + for [**Female First Name (un) **] with Urine cx showing E.Coli.
Source of blood infection unclear, thought to be ascending urinary tract, vaginal infection given fistula or AV fistula source.
No evidence of infection in AV fistula or any lines per transplant surgery.
A TTE was performed which showed an echodensity and they could not rule out a vegetation.
A TEE did not demonstrate any evidence of vegetation and AV graft showed no evidence of infection.
OB/GYN and ID felt candidemia [**Known firstname **] be secondary to source from fistula, and blood cultures cleared after she was started on micafungin.
# Rectovaginal fistula: The patient has a known diagnosis of rectovaginal fistula diagnosed in [**2096**].
When initially started on this on [**12-28**], she became hypothermic to 92 degrees and it was stopped.
Candidemia 2.
