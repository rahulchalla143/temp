Admission Date:  [**2180-8-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-10-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2180-8-2**]       Sex:  M  Service:  NEONATOLOGY HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 43835**] was born at 27 1/7 weeks gestation by a cesarean section for breech presentation and progressive pre-term labor.
This pregnancy was complicated by a subchorionic hematoma noted at 12 weeks gestation and vaginal bleeding from 14 weeks gestation.
An amniocentesis was done at 14 weeks due to nuchal thickening seen on ultrasound, and was found to be 46XY.
The infant emerged without ventilation and intubation in the delivery room.
He was treated with caffeine citrate for apnea of prematurity from day of life 12 until day of life 22.
He has been treated with Diuril from day of life 23 up until the present time for chronic lung disease.
He continues to have some bradycardia and desaturation associated with immature feeding coordination, but has had none at rest.
Cardiovascular:  The infant required pressor support for the first 48 hours of life, and also received some hydrocortisone for blood pressure support on day of life one and two.
Echocardiogram done on day of life one and two and seven revealed a patent foramen ovale with bidirectional shunting and a right-sided aortic arch and an aberrant left subclavian artery.
On examination, he has a Grade I-II systolic ejection murmur and is pink and well perfused.
He reached full volume feeding on day of life 15, was advanced to a maximum calorie-enhanced feed of 30 calories/ounce breast milk or formula.
Gastrointestinal:  He was treated with phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity from day of life number two until day of life 13.
He has a left inguinal hernia which was first noted on day of life number 48.
Infectious Disease:  He was started on ampicillin and gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk factors.
He remained off antibiotics since day of life 51, with an increase in requirements for ventilation support, and was started on vancomycin and ceftazidime.
On day of life number eight, his head ultrasound showed bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage and increasing ventricular size bilaterally.
The hemorrhage and clot have slowly resolved, and the ventricles have returned to [**Location 213**] size.
His last head ultrasound on [**10-20**] was within normal limits, with normal ventricular size and no signs of periventricular leukomalacia.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The infant is being transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] Surgical service under the care of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5715**] for repair of his left inguinal hernia.
Immunizations recommended:  Synagis respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks gestation; (2) Born between 32 and 35 weeks, with plans for day care during respiratory syncytial virus season, with a smoker in the household, or with preschool siblings; or (3) With chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for pre-term infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other care givers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
