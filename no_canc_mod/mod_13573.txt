Patient stayed home from work on Friday and Saturday, and patient noted a vesicular, nonpruritic, nonpainful rash that erupted on his anterior chest, arms, and back with sparing of his palms and soles.
The patient also noticed conjunctivitis with no discharge or itching.
He also had positive sputum productive of yellowish tan-colored sputum.
He also had some shortness of breath, but was able to speak in full sentences.

Generally:  The patient is young, shortness of breath, is speaking in full sentences, and appears in mild respiratory distress.
Patient has red conjunctivae sparing the limbus with positive cervical lymphadenopathy.
Lungs:  Left base crackles with E:A change at the left base, right basilar crackles are also noted, but left worse than right.
Skin:  There is a vesicular rash with an erythematous base, which is nonpruritic and blanchable noted on the anterior chest, arms, as well as back crusted over and appeared dry.
The lesions on the anterior chest and arms appear to be of the same age.
CHEST X-RAY:  Bilateral hazy infiltrates with left retrocardiac consolidation.
Pneumonia:  When patient initially presented to the hospital, patient had studies sent off for varicella zoster, herpes simplex types I and II, [**Month/Day (1) 50508**] and Gram stain for fungi as well as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 50508**] of the nasal swab for viruses, testing for Mycoplasma pneumonia by antibodies as well as by PCR, and antibody testing for [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus.
Additionally, skin biopsies of the patient's vesicular rash was done x2 to test for varicella.
The patient's microdata was all negative with the exception of elevated IgM as well as elevated IgG for Mycoplasma pneumonia.
Patient had a deep skin biopsy, which was then taken which was positive for erythema multiforme.
Patient's chest x-ray by time of completion of antibiotic regimen revealed that he had small bilateral pleural effusions and a left middle lobe infiltrate with resolution of the left lower lobe infiltrate.
Otherwise, the patient had two bronchoalveolar lavages done along with brushings, and these were completely negative for microorganisms.
The patient also had a CT of his chest performed on [**2111-10-6**] which was consistent with a new right middle lobe infiltrate which was felt to be secondary to BAL of the right middle lobe.
Throughout his hospitalization, patient had very thick blood-tinged expectorant from his lungs, which was felt to initially be consistent with desquamation caused by [**Known lastname **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome, and later given that his course was complicated by a left lower lobe pulmonary embolus which arose from a right upper extremity DVT, his blood-tinged sputum was thought to be caused by supratherapeutic PTT and airway changes from [**Initials (NamePattern4) 22721**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
By time of this discharge summary, his sputum became nonbloody and was mostly purulent in nature.
It should be noted that the patient had a very traumatic intubation on [**2111-9-28**].
His intubation was complicated by pneumomediastinum as well as a small pneumothorax on the left side.
It was felt that given patient's traumatic intubation, that patient should be extubated with trache placement on [**10-19**] in the OR given that patient could have possible subglottic stenosis.
As his pulmonary examination improved, he was maintained on pressure support ventilation and tolerated pressure support and PEEP of 5 without any complications.
His main limiting factors to extubation included very thick secretions as well as the patient becoming extremely agitated, diaphoretic, and tachypneic at extubation.
Surgery felt that was not indicated during the current admission given the patient's hepatic enzymes were not consistent with a cholecystitis picture.
Patient predominantly had elevations in AST and ALT, which by the time of discharge, were trending down and felt most likely secondary to his Tylenol usage for his fevers as well as his sedatives.
Patient also had an elevated lipase, and it was felt that this chemical pancreatitis was again caused by the enumerable medicines that the patient was on.
Another source contributing to the fevers included a right upper extremity DVT, which involved the axillary vein, but spared the superior vena cava and subsequently resulted in a small pulmonary embolus to the left lower lobe.
Line infections:  Patient had central lines placed in the subclavian, which was resighted on two occasions given the patient had persistent fevers.
Wound [**Month/Year (2) 50508**] of these lines were negative to date.
Once these medicines were discontinued, it was noted that patient's fever curve trended down and that by time of discharge, patient had no further spikes of fevers.
Reactive thrombocytosis:  During his hospitalization, it was noted that the patient had elevated platelet count to a high of 636.
Ophthalmology:  During his hospitalization, patient was noted to have very thickened conjunctivae with subconjunctival inflammation.
Endocrine:  Patient had hyperglycemic episodes during his hospitalization.
Renal function:  When patient initially presented to the hospital, he was given aggressive fluid resuscitation, and then later was diuresed with Lasix with a bump in his creatinine from baseline of 0.8 to 1.3.
Heme:  Patient's hematocrit remained stable throughout his hospitalization, but he did have one episode of hematocrit decreased to 22 felt secondary to his significant amounts of blood tinged sputum as well as phlebotomy.
