Admission Date:  [**2110-10-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2110-12-12**]   Service:  VASC [**Doctor First Name 147**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was an 84 year old gentleman with multiple past medical problems including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, history of sinus node dysfunction status post dual chamber pacemaker placement in [**2108-8-22**], history of long term hypertension, well known history of abdominal aortic aneurysm which was documented that had grown from 5.5 centimeters in [**2109-8-22**] to 7.2 mg on [**2110-9-17**].
He also had a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with a compromised ejection fraction of 40%.
He had a history of a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, history of degenerative joint disease.
The patient is status post left hip arthroplasty, history of left ventricular hypertrophy, history of mild aortic regurgitation with moderate mitral regurgitation and finally a history of hemorrhoidectomy in the distant past.
With his multiple medical problems, he presented to his primary care physician on the evening of [**10-10**] for weakness and general malaise.
He was transferred emergently to the Emergency Department where upon arrival he was found to be hypertensive and tachycardic.
Upon obtaining good intravenous access and resuscitating him with intravenous fluids and packed red blood cells, a CT scan was obtained and demonstrated a primary aortic enteric fistula.
While in the Emergency Room, the patient began bleeding red blood from nose, mouth as well as continued to have episodes of massive melena.
He was intubated for airway protection and the seriousness and acuity of his condition was discussed with the distant relatives present at that time Prior to his intubation, Mr. [**Known lastname 98538**] discussed going to surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Due to the aggressive resuscitation and the patient's instability, the abdomen was left open but covered with a sterile drape with drains as well as a pack.
Two days later, the patient improved moderately from a hemodynamic standpoint and it was decided that it was a reasonable time to attempt a primary closure.
He eventually grew Enterococcus klebsiella, Bacteroides fragilis as well as other organisms from the intraoperative cultures.
Over the course of the next couple of weeks, he became progressively icteric and he was noted to have an elevated bilirubin.
It was thought at that time that he might have had cholestasis since multiple ultrasounds did not reveal any signs of cholecystitis.
He was scheduled to undergo an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography at the beginning of [**Month (only) 359**] and this study did not reveal any potential blockage or obstruction.
He was found to have a moderate diffuse dilation of the common bile duct with some sludge, measuring about 12 millimeters and this is why he had a stent placed successfully in the common bile duct.
By the beginning of [**Month (only) **], he was tolerating trials of trach mask with on and off episodes of hypotension.
He was intermittently on and off pressors to treat this hypotension during this time .
During the entire month of [**Month (only) **], the patient appeared to wax and wane but ultimately became progressively sicker and deteriorated.
He developed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and he was growing Pseudomonas from his sputum.
The family was approached and informed repeated times about the seriousness of his condition and the likely poor prognosis of his postoperative course.
He continued to decline and progressively became sicker and more pressor dependent to keep adequate hemodynamics.
By the evening of [**2110-12-11**], he was more acidotic and minimally responsive with low blood pressure requiring a full ventilatory support to barely keep his saturations above the 90s.
The Primary Team was called to evaluate the patient and upon confirming the absence of corneal reflexes, tracheal reflex as well as a lack of spontaneous breathing or heart rate, nor any response to painful stimuli he was pronounced dead at 03:35 pm on [**2110-12-12**].
