Admission Date:  [**2119-8-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-9-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-11-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Prochlorperazine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: Worst headache of Life [**Last Name (un) **] eating dinner  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**8-4**]: Cerebral angiogram with coiling of ACOMM Artery Aneurysm [**8-8**]: Cerebral angiogram with intra-arterial verapamil [**8-9**]: Cerebral angiogram with intra-arterial verapamil & nicardipine [**8-21**]: Trach and PEG [**8-22**]: Cerebral angiogram with additional coiling of ACOMM   History of Present Illness: 61yoF, previously healthy, now transferred from [**Hospital6 10443**] with reported "worst headache of her life," found to have diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and left ACOM aneurysm.
Reportedly, she was eating dinner at approximately 5:30pm when she complained of a severe headache, suddenly became somnolent and aphasic in association with acute onset of L-sided hemiparesis.
No trauma or h/o previous symptoms.
She received fentanyl and versed for sedation; no anti-epileptics were given.
Reportedly she did not follow any commands and was observed to have decorticate posturing, left upper extremity and withdrawal to painful stimuli, lower extremities bilateral.
At the OSH, she underwent a head CT which revealed a large, diffuse SAH and was subsequently Medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical management.
Pertinent Results: [**2119-8-3**] CTA head:  IMPRESSION: Recently ruptured left anterior communicating artery aneurysm with extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular extension.
No evidence of vasospasm, no other aneurysms.
Slight decrease in size of right lateral ventricle, with bowing of the septum pellucidum into the right lateral ventricle and unchanged or slightly enlarged left lateral ventricle.
No increase in extensive subarachnoid blood.
Interval introduction of pneumocephalus seen within the right greater than left frontal horns and the right temporal ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage.
There is a small focus of hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, adjacent to the hematoma and coil, new since the study of [**2119-8-4**], and likely reflecting infarction.
Unchanged appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage, left frontal hematoma and right frontal infarct.
Small amount of subdural hemorrhage along the falx posteriorly to the left, potentially related to the decompression from the ventriculostomy placement.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of increase in subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Previously noted subarachnoid hemorrhage is slightly evolved in the interval.
Coiling in the region of anterior communicating artery with an adjacent hypodensity as before.
[**8-7**]- pending  EEG : This EEG telemetry from [**Date range (1) 87361**] showed persistent sleep or medication-related patterns with no major change in frequency or voltage over the time of the recording.
There were no epileptiform features.
[**8-14**] EEG This monitoring of cerebral function from [**Date range (1) 10831**]/[**2118**] showed a profoundly suppressed background at the beginning and throughout the recording.
There was no major asymmetry in background voltages.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
Multifocal narrowing in the proximal course of the anterior cerebral arteries bilaterally adjacent to the anterior communicating artery coiling suggestive of vasospasm.
[**2119-8-16**] EEG  This monitoring of cerebral function from [**Date range (1) 61726**]/[**2118**] showed a profoundly suppressed background throughout the recording.
There was no major asymmetry in background voltages.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
[**2119-8-18**] EEG This EEG telemetry showed a slow and low voltage background throughout.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
Status post removal of an external ventricular drain, without evidence of hemorrhage in the tube tract.
No new intracranial hemorrhage  [**2119-8-22**]: CT head 1.
Persistent scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the cerebral convexities with no evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.
Multiple acute infarcts in the watershed territory between the right anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries.
Chronic blood products in the anterior interhemispheric fissure, within the sulci of both hemispheres, and in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
Review of prior studies suggests that there was prior hemorrhage into this lesion.
[**2119-8-29**] UE Doppler: Occlusive thrombus seen within the left basilic vein.
No DVT seen in the remainder of the veins of the left arm.
ECG [**2119-8-30**]: Sinus rhythm and frequent atrial ectopy in a trigeminal pattern.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2119-8-24**] no diagnostic interim change.
An external ventricular drain was placed for hydrocephalus and shortly thereafter her exam improved tremendously to the point that she became arrousable and was following all comands and moving all four extremities.
She was taken to Angio on [**8-4**] where she was found to have and left ACOMM artery aneurysm.
This was succesfully coiled without complication but will require further coiling with a stent in the near future.
On [**8-6**] [**Month/Year (2) 5041**] was clamped and she was started on SQH for DVT prophylaxsis.
Pt noted to have increase heart rate into 150's and EKG showed atrial fibrilation.
The drain was left at 20cm above the tragus and she had no further episodes of increased ICP.
Her episodes of atrial fibrilation did resolve and she had no further tachycardia and no further treatment.
She was also not following commands with her lower extremities and not moving them spontaneously.
A stat head ct showed no change from prior exam and no hydrocephalus or infarct.
On [**8-9**] The patient developed garbled speech and disorientation.
While in angio the patient became tachycardic and developed pulmonary edema requiring intubation.
She progressed to cardiogenic shock and cardiology was consulted for assistance with managment and possible balloon pump.
The patient developed multiple arrythmias requiring cardioversion.
LFT's were very high and elevated INR is suspected secondary to the liver failure.
[**8-21**]: Bedside trach and Peg without complication.
We consulted infectious disease for persistant fevers and nephrology for persistant respiratory alkalosis.
The thought was that her fever was possibly related to the Keppra.
A rash was noted on her bilateral UE and chest.
on [**8-29**] patient was started on a heparin drip for stroke and a right upper extremity DVT.
On [**8-30**] she was noted to have some telemetry changes and cardiac enzymes were done which showed a Troponin of 0.02 which repeat Troponin was 0.08 then trended down [**Date range (1) 43500**].
