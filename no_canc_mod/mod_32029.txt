Poor R wave progression.
TWI in v1-v2.
No comparison available   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 10208**] is a 53yo morbidly obese male with h/o ETOH abuse who presented with severe hypoxia and hypertension.
1)Hypoxia: Patient presented with severe hypoxia, oxygen sats 70s on room air.
His relative lack of symptoms and elevated HCT and bicarb suggests that this is chronic process and is felt to be multifactorial secondary to obesity hypoventilation, central and obstructive sleep apnea, diastolic CHF, and obstructive lung disease.
He did not have findings on CXR to suggest an underlying pneumonia or other acute process and CTA was negative for PE.
He did not have evidence of pulmonary edema  but given elevated BNP, he was felt to have some component of diastolic CHF and was diuresed about 15L in the MICU with some improvement in oxygen requirement.
BiPAP was initiated and titrated by respiratory although he was still found to intermittently desaturate into the 70s overnight while sleeping when he would become apneic and hypertensive.
Backup rate was added for component of central as well as obstructive sleep apnea.
He was provided with BiPap machine and home oxygen at time of discharge due to persistently low oxygen saturations (77% on room air with ambulation, 89-90% on room air at rest) and was prescribed lasix 20 daily for ongoing management of volume status.
2)Hypertensive urgency: Patient presented with elevated SBPs~200's.
He was asymptomatic and had not been on any anti-hypertensives as an outpatient.
3)Renal insufficiency: Patient presented with Cr of 1.3 on admission and no known baseline.
He was started on low dose Lasix 20mg PO daily for maintenance of volume status and will have repeat labs next week at new PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  4) Pulmonary Hypertension:Pt has moderate pulmonary HTN on echo likely from chronic hypoxia as well as sleep apnea.
He was discharged on home oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations >89% and with management of sleep apnea with BiPap.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis Hypoxia secondary to mixed obstructive and central sleep apnea Secondary Diagnosis Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, oxygen sats 77% with ambulation on room air, 89% on 4L with ambulation, 88-90% on room air at rest, normotensive   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with low oxygen in your blood and high blood pressure.
ALbutero inhaler as needed  Please return to the ER or call your primary care doctor if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, increased lower extremity edema, lightheadedness, dizziness, or any other concerning symptoms.
You should arrive at this appointment 15 minutes earlier to have your labs checked.
