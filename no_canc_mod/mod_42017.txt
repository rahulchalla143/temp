Admission Date:  [**2182-9-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-9-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-11-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15397**] Chief Complaint: cholecystitis, transfer from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital MICU for ERCP  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP  History of Present Illness: 86M with CAD s/p DES to LAD x 4 in [**1-/2180**], TIA s/p CEA in [**2179**], and h/o failed laparascopic cholecystectomy [**2178**] with nonvisualization of gallbladder on [**9-20**] abdominal [**Hospital 4338**] transferred from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital on [**9-22**] after failed ERCP on [**9-21**] for cholangitis complicated by gram-negative bacteremia.
Briefly, the patient present to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital on [**9-20**] with severe abdominal pain worsened by inspiration and was found to be febrile to 102.7, tachycardic to HR 130s, and have significant LFT abnormalities (lipase 6391, T.bili 1.7, D. bili 1.3, AST 281, ALT 134, AP 285).
He had some hypotension to SBP 90s on the night of admission, however he never required pressor support.
Also noted were a medium-sized hiatal hernia, as well as an oozing superficial duodenal ulcer in the bulb with no stigmata of recent bleeding.
Given that the patient is on Plavix (last dose 8/24 AM), it was decided to hold off on dilating the stricture and transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his cholangitis.
He had an attempted laparascopic cholecystectomy in [**2178**] which was aborted due to extensive adhesions, but he and his family are certain that he has not had his gallbladder removed.
GI consult at [**Location (un) 8641**] suggested that he might have a congenital atrophic gallbladder or he might have had recurrent attacks of acute cholecystitis causing him to have significant fibrosis and shrinking of the gallbladder.
The patient appears jaundiced but comfortable and denies any abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p DES (Xience) to LAD x 4 in [**2180**] (reportedly performed at [**Hospital3 **], EF 45%) - TIA [**8-/2179**] s/p right carotid endarterectomy [**10/2179**]: no significant residual deficits.
Most recently had an episode of amaurosis fugax in spring [**2182**] & saw his neurologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6692**], who did carotid dopplers on [**2182-5-30**] that showed severe bilateral ICA disease >70% bilaterally.
- H/o cholecystitis s/p failed laparascopic cholecystectomy in [**2178**].
Reportedly surgeon was unable to perform procedure because of [**Last Name (un) **] adhesions around the gallbladder; unclear why procedure was not converted to open.
- Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - S/p right inguinal herniorhapy x 3 with 3rd operation requiring removal of his right testicle ([**2140**]) - Meniere's disease with recent complaints of refractory dizziness earlier this summer [**2182**] - Tinnitus (likely related to Meniere's) - Hearing loss in left ear - Seizure disorder on low-dose Tegretol (did not tolerate switch to Keppra; high-dose Tegretol has been associated with cognitive slowing).
EEG showed L temporal seizure activity.
- GERD - BPH - Asthma    Social History: Denies any tobacco or illicit drug use.

Microbiology: [**9-21**] [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital blood cultures (PRELIM): 4 of 4 bottles growing GNRs - Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive to augmentin.
An atrophic and severely collapsed gallbladder may be present versus a markedly thick walled cystic duct remnant.
The point of convergence of the cystic duct and CHD is difficule to ascertain but the segment of duct presumed to represent the CBD is diffusely and markedly thick walled and heterogeneous.
This may relate to chronic inflammatory change, cholangitis or neoplasm (i.e.
No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Recommend further evaluation with ERCP and brushings.
Second portion of duodenum appears markedly collapsed or atrophic, but no mass identified in this region.
Hiatal hernia containing GE junction and transdiaphragmatic herniation of hepatic dome which appears to be exerting a degree of mass effect on the cephalad IVC.
No pancreatic mass or pancreatic duct dilatation identified.
No focal or free fluid identified within the abdomen.
Mild compression deformity of the superior endplate of T11.
Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
ERCP: A medium size hiatal hernia was seen, displacing the Z-line to 35 cm from the incisors, with hiatal narrowing at 40 cm from the incisors.
A salmon colored mucosa distributed in a segmental pattern, suggestive of short segment Barrett's Esophagus was found.
Mild resistance was noted to passage of the scope.
Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
A mild diffuse dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring 8 mm.
No filling defects were noted.
There is collection of contrast in the right lobe of the liver suggestive of intrahepatic gallbladder.
No sludge or stones noted.
Cholangitis involving the extra-hepatic, gallbladder, and central left lobe biliary system.
Chronic atrophy of the left hepatic lobe may be secondary to prior biliary pathology; there is not evidence for a current obstruction of the left ducts.
New small right hepatic subcapsular bile collection compared to CT, which correlates with bile collection seen on ERCP.
Diminutive gallbladder may be from congenital atrophy as there is no evidence of surgical resection.
No evidence of intrahepatic gallbladder.
Moderate stenosis of the SMA over medium length segment from atherosclerosis.

# Cholangitis: Patient presented with evidence of biliary obstruction that was unable to be relieved during ERCP at [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital on [**9-21**] secondary to duodenal stricture.
In the context of the patient also being on Plavix and concern for bleeding during dilation or possible sphincterotomy, it was decided to transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management and repeat attempt at ERCP.
A CT abdomen was done which revealed a potentially atrophic vs. collapsed gallbladder and signs concerning for cholangitis.
He had evidence of prior sphincterotomy and likely passed stones prior to procedure.
He should follow up with his primary care physician for further evaluation of his symptoms.
No evidence of any masses appreciated.
# Pancreatitis: Patient presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital with elevated lipase; thought to be secondary to gallstone pancreatitis in the setting of biliary obstruction/cholangitis.
MRCP did not show evidence of pancreatitis.
CT abdomen in house showed atrophic pancreas with no signs of inflammation.
He denied any symptoms and his lipase trended to normal.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Patient presented with a Cr of 1.5.
This was most likely prerenal in the context of hypotension from sepsis and volume depletion.
No reason to suspect intrinsic renal or post-renal etiology.
# H/o TIA/CAD : Patient takes Plavix both for h/o TIA/medical management of cerebrovascular disease, as well as CAD s/p 4 DES to LAD in [**2180-1-28**].
Given need for stricture dilatation and possible sphincterotomy, will hold Plavix for now to reduce risk of bleeding.
# QTc prolongation: Patient had an EKG that showed prolonged QTc (>550msec) while at [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital.
# Seizure disorder: Continued Tegretol 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Asthma/COPD: Patient had some wheezing after his ERCP at [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital on [**9-21**] that was relieved with bronchodilators.
PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] who informed us that he has had no PFTs in the past and likely has only been diagnosed with mild intermittent asthma.
# BPH: Continued finasteride.
