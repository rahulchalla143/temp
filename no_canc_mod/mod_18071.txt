He was given 4 L of a banana bag in the ED, which was changed to MVI, thiamine and folic acid PO once the patient was transferred to the floor.
# Elevated CK: Pt presented wtih elevated CK, but had flat MB and trop.
The patient did not need high rate IVF for this the elevated CKs.
# Transaminitis: Pt w/ mildly elevated LFTs on presentation which appear stable.
The transaminitis is likely due to alcoholic liver disease.
Otherwise, the patient had no other signs of synthetic dysfunction as his albumin and coags were within normal limits.
# Thrombocytopenia: Pt presented with mild thrombocytopenia (down to 98) on CBC.
This is likely secondary to marrow suppression vs splenic sequestration from EtOH.
# Malrotation of C1-C2: Pt had C-spine film that demonstrated rotation of C1 and C2, which may be positional.
It also showed a cystic structure lateral to the left massator muscle may represent a sebaceous cyst but it should be clinically correlated.
