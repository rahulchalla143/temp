We monitored you overnight and your symptoms resolved and  your sugars were controlled with your home insulin pump.
You were also complaining of shoulder pain from your right rotator cuff and you are scheduled for follow up with ortho to have a cortisone injection.
You should not take tramadol any longer due to the adverse reaction of nausea and vomiting which may have caused you to go into DKA.
