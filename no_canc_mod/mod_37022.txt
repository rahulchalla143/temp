He was admitted for CIWA and w/u of R flank pain.
He was found to have very high CIWA needs on the floor, receiving 10mg Valium q1h plus a 60mg load on admission.
He had films of his feet due to continued pain in his heels that were neg for fx.
CT showed a fractured L rib but no abcess.
Flank pain was thought to be due to refered rib fx pain, enlarged liver, and chronic pancreatitis.
He had a MRI due to his hx of sz that showed diffuse cortical and profound cerebellar atrophy without other deficit.
[**1-23**] grew out pan-sensitive MSSE.
PT was consulted and found no deficit that would improve with rehab.
COURSE BY SYSTEM: # R flank/abdominal pain: This was thought to be due to his enlarged liver stretching the capsule vs pancreatitis secondary to alcohol vs referred pain from a L rib fracture.
Amylase was normal and lipase slightly elevated at 85.
The patient had no signs of pyelonephritis and CT showed no hydronephrosis nor other kidney changes.
He did have mild cholecystitis.
# EtOH withdrawal: On admission, the patient had [**Known firstname **] tremors, hyperacusis, photophobia, startle response and hypertension as well as diaphoresis.
Given his symptoms and his history of delerium tremens/ seizures, he was given 20mg of valium q1 hour for 3 hours after which he was changed to a q1 hour CIWA scale with diazepam.
In the unit he did well (had infection as below) and was tapered off of his diazepam.
During this time he had no fevers and was not treated with antibiotics.
His urine sodium was low, suggesting that he had a dilute urine in the face of hyponatremia.
# h/o asthma: some fine crackles on exam.
There were no issues at this hospitalization.
# heel pain: x rays to eval for fracture were negative.
PT consult felt that while he was somewhat unsteady on his crutches, he had no rehab potential as his unsteadiness was likely due to his permanent cerebellar damage.
# anemia - This was mild and stable and was likely due to marrow suppression from etoh, wbc also low.
Disp:*40 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Beer Potomania Heel Pain NOS Intoxication Uncomplicated Withdrawal Seizure disorder Alcoholic Cortical Atrophy   Discharge Condition: Stable, able to bear wt, no signs of impending DT's or seizure, tolerating liquids.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for intoxication and because of your inability to walk.
There are no fractures.
You were given an MRI because you have seizures - it showed some damage to your brain that could be from heavy alcohol consumption.
