The patient's wife states that he had worsening confusion for the 2 days prior to admission.
His mental status was largely intact but he did have episodes of agitation which responded to low dose haldol.
On the floor, he was afebrile and had no further GI bleeding.
On the call of call-out he triggered for tachypnea, and he did occasionally have brief (1 minute) self limited episodes of tachypnea with associated desaturations to the mid-low 80's.
These were largely felt to be due to anxiety and he responded well to low dose haldol and ativan.
Later that afternoon, he became hypoxic to the mid 70's and had increased somnolence.
An ABG showed extreme hypercarbia to 99.
Due to his worsening CO2 narcosis/somnolence, he was voluntarily intubated and transferred back to the MICU for further management.

Bowel gas pattern demonstrates no definite evidence of ileus or obstruction.
There is no free air on upright view.
Brief Hospital Course: Summary: 67 year old man with history of COPD, OSA, aflutter s/p ablation with recent subacute altered mental status transferred from OSH for w/u hematochezia found to have [**5-12**] blood cx +enterococcus.
# Enterococcal bacteremia: The source of the infection was unclear as culture data was incomplete.
Pt initially treated with linezolid; when sensitivities returned, he was transitioned to IV ampicillin with a two week course planned.
He was started  on IV ampicillin and remained afebrile until his transfer back to the ICU on [**1-17**] for hypoxia and hypercarbia.
He was noted to have worsening leukopenia and thromocytopenia while on ampicillin and although it has probable better coverage than vancomycin, the ampicillin was replace by vancomycin for total 14-day course.
# Respiratory: Pt began treatment at OSH for pseudomonas and proteus PNA with ceftazidime on [**12-30**]; this was d/c'd after a 14 days.
There was initially a question of possible TB exposure given cavitary lesions reported on OSH CT, but AFB stain of BAL were negative.
A CT in-house shows emphysematous lesions, retained secretions with L upper lobe lung nodules and RML collapse.
Pt also w/ significant COPD on high-dose steroids.
However, on [**1-17**], he demonstrated increasing somnolence and an ABG showed a CO2 of 99, so the patient was intubated for ventilation and transferred back to the ICU.
His respiratory distress appeared to be exacerbated by anxiety as well as intolerance of face mask.
His anxiety also makes Bipap nearly impossible and he cannot use it to treat his sleep apnea.
Anxiety control is therefore paramount to his respiratory status with emphasis on minimizing meds that will cause somnolence and respiratory depression.
# Hematochezia: A lower source of bleeding was felt more likely over upper source based on the presence of bright red blood.
Differential included diverticular bleed, ischemic colitis, polyp, hemorrhoid.
His HCTs were entirely stable on the floor and he had no further episodes of BRBPR.
# Mental Status and Anxiety: The patient's subacute change in MS was felt likely related to steroids, sedating medications, prolonged hospitalization.
# Atrial Tachycardia: The pt's home dose of diltiazem had been lowered given bleed; this was slowly titrated back up with good effect, though is baseline HR is in 100s .
Lactulose 10 gram/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for shakiness, agitation: hold for sedation or respiratory rate <10; prn haldol should be first-line [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Haloperidol Lactate 5 mg/mL Solution Sig: One (1) mg Injection Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for agitation.

You were seen by the GI consult service and because you did not appear to have an acute active bleed and your blood counts remained stable, you can follow-up with them as an outpatient.
You were being treated for pneumonia on your arrival and you finished a 14-day course of antibiotics.
You were noted to have bacteria in your blood and were started on intravenous antibiotics.
It is unclear what [**Doctor Last Name **] source of the bacteria was, put the indwelling IV catheter (PICC) from the OSH or a urinary tract infection were suspected.
You also had difficulty with your breathing and required intubation for respiratory distress.
