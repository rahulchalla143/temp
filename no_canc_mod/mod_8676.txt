Aneurysm of ascending aorta and aortic arch.
Status post colonic polypectomy.
Aneurysm of ascending aorta and aortic arch, status post    replacement of ascending aorta and hemi-arch and aortic    valve resuspension with 32 mm gel-weave tube graft.
Status post colonic polypectomy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old female who was found to have mildly dilated abdominal aortic aneurysm on work-up for a heart murmur she had been diagnosed with.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: The patient was afebrile and hemodynamically normal.
Heart: Exam was notable for a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur but was otherwise essentially unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2168-5-3**], and on that same day, she underwent replacement of her ascending aorta and hemi-arch and aortic valve resuspension with a 32 mm gel-weave tube graft.
She was extubated mid day, on postoperative day #1, and subsequently developed respiratory acidosis, which was felt to be secondary to a combination of pain medication and respiratory fatigue.
She was subsequently placed on BIPAP ventilation over night, which she tolerated well, which allowed for resolution of her respiratory acidosis without use of further invasive ventilation.
She was transferred to the general floor on postoperative day #3 where she continued to do well with her main issue essentially being pulmonary toilet for low oxygen saturation.
It was felt that by postoperative day #7, as the patient had been afebrile, she had otherwise been hemodynamically normal, with a pulse in the 70-80s and a systolic pressure in the 120s, with an oxygen saturation of 100% on 2 L, and otherwise unremarkable physical examination with only trace edema in the extremities and a clean wound, that the patient could be safely discharged to home with home physical therapy and home oxygenation.
