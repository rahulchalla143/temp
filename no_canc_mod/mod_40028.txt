His hospital course was notable for hypoxia and hypotension on [**2-28**] in the setting of blood transfusion, with Klebsiella pneumoniae in [**5-14**] blood culture bottles.
He was noted to have guiac positive stools.
He did experience an elevation of his cardiac enzymes thought c/w NSTEMI vs demand ischemia; this was medically treated with beta blocker/ASA/statin.
At ERCP, the CBD was cannulated with pancreatogram showing distal filling defects c/w stones.
He became hypotensive to the 70's and hypoxic to the 70's during the procedure.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-12**] for ERCP and further management of his biliary sepsis.
Currently c/o mild right sided abd pain.

Successful cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
Cholangiogram showed multiple large filling defects consistent with stones in the CBD.
[**3-15**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**3-18**] CXR Minimal interval improvement in pulmonary edema is noted with unchanged left retrocardiac atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in pulmonary edema still accompanied by large bilateral pleural effusions.
Left retrocardiac atelectasis.
Biliary sepsis with Klebsiella bacteremia The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-12**] for planned ERCP.
He was continued on vancomycin and zosyn for coverage of the Klebsiella and MRSA isolated at the OSH.
He was started on Xigris on [**3-14**] which was initially complicated by some hematuria and heme positive stools.
By [**3-17**] he developed grossly bloody stools.
Labs on [**3-18**] showed evidence of low level DIC.
After discussion with the family regarding the patient's extremely poor prognosis in setting of respiratory failure, candidemia, cholangitis, and transfusion dependent GI bleed the decision was made to make the patient CMO.
Opthalmology exam showed no evidence of fungal retinitis.
Respiratory failure, ARDS The patient remained ventilatory dependent during his hospitalization with P/F ratios less than 200 and bilateral infiltrates c/w ARDS.
Gastrointestinal bleeding GI bleeding as above.
Acute renal failure The patient's creatinine remained essentially stable at 1.8 above his recent baseline, with elevation thought likely due to ATN in setting of hypotension.
COPD We continued the patient on his bronchodilators.
CAD By report he had a NSTEMI versus demand ischemia at the OSH prior to transfer.
His troponin was mildly elevated at admission but remained flat on serial check.
EKG showed diffuse T wave inversions.
