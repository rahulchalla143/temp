He was taken to outside hospital where head CT revealed left frontal cerebral contusion and nondisplaced linear occipital skull fracture.
Repeat head CT in ED showed progression of left frontal contusion and new right frontal cerebral contusion with left temporal subdural hematoma and approximately 3 mm of left to right midlie shift.
Past Medical History: PMHx: sleep apnea low back pain urinary retention  PSHx: right hip fracture s/p fusion  Social History: Social Hx: lives at home with family; no tobacco; no EtOH; no IVDU   Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: O: T: 98.9 BP: 161/89   HR: 78   R 16      O2Sats 100% Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
Neuro: Mental status: lethargic; no eye opening; minimally responsive.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Significant interval progression of right frontal lobe hemorrhagic contusion with essentially stable left frontal contusion, bifrontal subdural hematomas which extend along the cerebral convexities.
Interval increase in cerebral edema and evidence of early downward transtentorial herniation.
Non-displaced right occipital skull fracture is unchanged.
Head CT s/p bolt placement [**2171-6-20**]: Progression of hemorrhagic contusions in the right lateral frontal and left temporal lobes.
There is diffuse cerebral edema.
Head CT [**2171-6-20**]: No change in the appearance of hemrrhagic parechymal contusions, mass effect and diffuse cerebral edema.
Head CT [**2171-6-20**]: No change in the appearance of hemrrhagic parechymal contusions, mass effect and diffuse cerebral edema.
Head CT [**2171-6-21**]: No significant change in appearance of bifrontal and left temporal hemorrhagic contusions, with surrounding mass effect and diffuse cerebral edema.
Head CT [**2171-6-23**]: Allowing for the differences in the slice selection, no significant change in appearance of bifrontal and left temporal hemorrhagic contusions with surrounding mass effect and diffuse edema.
Findings consistent with chronic lipoma and associated calcification.
His ICPs continued to run below 10 and only briefly rose to 20 on one occasion when off sedation for a formal neurological examination.
A speech and swallow evaluation recommended continued tube feeds because of aspiration risks from altered mental status.
Tube feeds were initiated via PEG 24hrs later without complications.
