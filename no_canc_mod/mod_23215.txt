ANTEPARTUM COURSE:  The maternal history and pregnancy were notable for chronic hypertension (on labetalol and hydrochlorothiazide) and primary herpes simplex infection in the first trimester of pregnancy (on acyclovir, then again intrapartum, but no current lesions).
There was an intrapartum maternal fever to 100.6 degrees.
Artificial ruptures of membranes occurred 14 hours prior to delivery.
There were no herpetic lesions, and the mother received antiviral suppression with acyclovir in the intrapartum period.
Generally, the infant was well- appearing, nondysmorphic in no acute distress.
His heart rate had a regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, and femoral pulses were 2 plus and symmetric.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
He had a positive suck, positive palmar and positive plantar reflex.
Pustules were noted on dorsal aspect of both forearms with a few hyperpigmented macules distally, consistent with benign pustular melanosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  RESPIRATORY: There were no issues.
[**Location (un) **] was in room air for his entire admission.
CARDIOVASCULAR: He had a regular rate and rhythm and no murmur.
Because of mom's history of a primary herpes infection during the first trimester and the baby's pustular lesions noted at delivery, could not entirely exclude the possibility of an HSV infection.
NEUROLOGY: [**Location (un) **] has maintained a normal neurological exam during admission, and there are no concerns.
Ad lib feeds primarily expressed breast milk or Enfamil.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the     child's life, immunization against influenza is     recommended for household contacts and out-of-home     caregivers.
Status post sepsis evaluation with antibiotics, ruled out.
Suspicion of possible viral infection, ruled out.
