Pregnancy notable for IUI assisted gestation.
Maternal history notable for hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine with stable TSH during pregnancy.
The pregnancy was complicated by development of preeclampsia resulting at maternal admission at 22 weeks gestation.
She has been treated with bed rest, Atenolol, and Procardia since then with stable blood pressures but persistent proteinuria.
The night prior to delivery she developed intermittent contractions and in the morning was found to have cervical dilatation prompting cesarean section delivery.
There was no maternal fever or other risk factors for sepsis noted.
Infant #1 emerged with good tone and moderate cry, becoming more vigorous with stimulation and blow-by oxygen.
In the NICU, he had moderate respiratory distress and was, therefore, intubated.
In general, a well developed premature infant, active with exam with moderate respiratory distress.
Skin: Warm, well perfuse, no bruising, no rashes.
No murmur or gallop.
Extremities: Warm, no lesions.
He was  weaned on the ventilator over the first 2 days of his life but then in the evening on day of life #3 had increasing acidosis and ventilatory needs.
He has had some slight indications of a very small amount of bleeding from his ET tube with suctioning.
CARDIOVASCULAR: On day of life #2, he was noted to have a harsh systolic murmur and was, therefore, started on indomethacin.
He received 3 doses of indomethacin and his murmur has disappeared.
He has had stable blood pressures and perfusion and has never had any need for inotropic support.
He did receive [**2-2**] trophic feeding volumes prior to development of his murmur but has been n.p.o.
