NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
TISSUE (Final [**2187-12-24**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2187-12-27**]):    NO GROWTH.
Epidural abscess/osteomyelitis- On admission pt had a known L4-L5 epidural abscess diagnosed by MRI 1 month previously, which did not grow any organisms on culture but was presumably a consequence of recent E. coli sepsis.
There was no evidence of spinal cord/nerve compression on exam.
The surgery went well with no procedural complications; intraoperative wound culture was negative, which is consistent with suppression of infection by continuing antibiotics.
After the surgery, the pt had decreased back and leg pain.
Post-op pain was controlled initially with Dilaudid PCA, but was transitioned after a few days to oral methadone for long-acting analgesia, with good pain control.
The pt had no signs of active infection during his admission, except possibly his post-op hypotension as below.
At d/c, his chronic back pain is well controlled.
Confusion On admission, his wife reported that he had increased confusion over the prior 2 weeks, with increased parasomnia manifested by sleep talking.
This was thought to be [**2-5**] overuse of opioids, as the pt had been taking more opioid meds for back pain recently.
At discharge, pt is on oxycodone 5 mg q4-6 hrs prn with good pain control.
There are no signs of osteomyelitis making infection an unlikely source as pt also continues to improve.
He was treated w/ insulin during prior admission after the pt developed poor blood glucose control in the setting of epidural abscess.
However, pt had episodes of hypoglycemia on insulin at home, and so insulin had been discontinued before admission.
At this point, BP climbed gradually, requiring the resumption of previous medications.
At d/c, BP is moderately controlled.
He will require follow-up with his PCP for titration of BP meds.
Post-operative hypotension- After his surgery, the pt developed hypotension while in the PACU to 80s systolic, along with tachycardia and agitation.
Central line was attempted, but complicated by a right carotid puncture and line placement; this line was d/c'd and pressure held with good hemostasis achieved.
The pt was started on Neo-Synephrine gtt for hypotension with good response, and was transferred to the MICU.
His hypotension was most likely [**2-5**] volume depletion, as he had been taking poor PO fluids and had been NPO before surgery, with large open surgical wound during procedure.
CHF- No signs of decompensated heart failure during his admission.
Low back pain- Mr. [**Known lastname 103960**] has chronic back pain [**2-5**] disc herniation, and pain was increased in weeks before admission likely from epidural abscess.
He had been requiring increased opioids for pain before admission, which may have been contributing to increased confusion.
On admission, long-acting methadone was discontinued and pain was treated w/ IV morphine prn, with good pain control.
Post-operatively, pain was managed with Dilaudid PCA, which was then transitioned to methadone and then to oxycodone prn.
Anemia- History of anemia secondary to ESRD.
However, it trended down continuously during his stay to a nadir of 26, likely secondary to hemodilution as a result of continuous fluid therapy.
He was transfused 2 units of PRBCs during hemodialysis on [**2187-12-25**], with good HCT response.
At d/c, there are no symptoms or clinical sequelae of anemia and Hct 33.6 on discharge.
Hypercalcemia:  Calcium was slightly elevated during his admission.
PTH was elevated, which in the setting of hypercalcemia indicates tertiary hyperparathyroidism [**2-5**] ESRD.
ESRD: he has renal failure [**2-5**] anti-GBM disease.
He was followed by the Renal team during his admission, and received HD on his usual schedule during his stay, with no complications.
Sight without problem and [**Name (NI) 3899**].
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever and pain.
Sliding Scale insulin PEr attached sheet   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Epidural abscess Pain control Delirium  Secondary diagnosis: End stage renal disease Depression Diabettes Mellitus 2 Hypertension Congestive Heart Failure Anemia Hypercalcemia   Discharge Condition: Mr. [**Known lastname 103960**] had his epidural abscess debrided and spinal stabilization.
His pain is well controlled and he is mentating much better, though he does sundown and get agitated.
-Long acting narcotics should be avoided for pain control.
Oxycodone should be used as it is short acting.
