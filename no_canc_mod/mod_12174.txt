Prenatal screens revealed blood B positive, antibody negative, group B strep status unknown, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, Rubella immune, rapid plasma reagin nonreactive.
ANTEPARTUM COURSE:  Antepartum course remarkable for spontaneous dichorionic-diamniotic twins.
She was readmitted on [**11-24**] through [**12-4**] for decreased fetal movement and spontaneous decelerations, and oligohydramnios of twin A.
The mother with cesarean section for breech positioning of twin B.

He is doing well on room air with comfortable respiratory pattern.
He has not had any episodes of apnea of prematurity and has not required methylxanthine therapy.
No fluid boluses or pressors have been required for blood pressure support.
A murmur was noted on morning of transfer.
Murmur consistent with peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
Plan to follow murmur and consider ECHO if clinical course/exam changes.
