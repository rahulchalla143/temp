He was transferred to the MICU initially, and surgery was consulted for concern regarding necrotizing fasciitis in the face of elevated WBC and signs of sepsis.
CV: At admission, his pressures did drop and upon transfer to the MICU on [**8-5**] he required three pressors to maintain his BP.
Patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint at time of discharge  Pulm: He was initially intubated on [**8-5**] after transfer to the MICU due to worsening ventilation and combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis on ABG.
These were held as needed for a return trip to the OR on [**8-10**] for washout and partial closure, and then restarted postoperatively.
They were titrated up to goal and he tolerated them with low residuals.
ID: At initial presentation he was septic [**1-23**] necrotizing fasciitis in his left lower extremity.
Patient was continued on antibiotics until time of discharge and was discharged without antibiotics, afebrile with stable WBC.
