Per report during the walk he started to have a headache and neck pain so he stopped walking and returned home.
His headache continued and he became confused and EMS was called and he was brought to [**Hospital 6685**] Hospital.
There a CT was done and he was noted to have a R basal ganglia bleed with IVH/  He had an INR of 2.2 and he was given one unit of FFP and was transferred to [**Hospital6 6689**] for further eval.
Prior to the intubation he was seen by neurosurgery, the exam documented listed that he was irritable and disinhibited but alert and responsive.
His first new ischemic lesion was seen on head CT on [**3-7**].
Since [**3-5**] follow up head CT have shown the development of new ischemic lesions (CT's are listed below).
He has had the development of a small ischemic stroke in the R MCA territory, a small left occipital ischemic stroke, and small left cortical ischemic stroke; there was some hemorrhagic conversion of the left cortical ischemic stroke.
At the time a CTV was recommended which showed a new right middle frontal gyrus ischemic stroke but no venous thrombosis was identified.
TEE was just performed and revealed a moderate PFO with right left shunt.
Patient spiked a fever to 101 degrees this morning; no source has been identified.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], last exam in nursing note documents eyes closed, not following commands, moving R arm against restraint (an exam earlier in the day reported he was opening eyes to verbal stim and squeezing hands when asked no clear how much sedation was on board)  ROS is not available currently   Past Medical History: - CAD s/p CABG - a.fib on coumadin - HTN - Hyperlipidemia - Hep C - DM - BPH - s/p splenectomy secondary to trauma - h/o GI bleed [**1-18**] duodenal ulcer - s/p cholecystectomy - s/p PPM placement   Social History: - Per chart, lives with wife at home.

CT [**3-6**] - no significant change in IVH, mild communicating hydrocephalus compared from prior CT .
CT [**3-6**] - Extensive IVH and hydrocephalus unchanged from prior exam .
CXR [**2180-3-7**] (multiple) - Bibasilar infiltrates and pleural effusion, unchanged from prior - pacer noted .

Hypodense areas in the right parieto-occipital lobe and the left superior frontoparietal lobe with tiny foci of hemorrhage in the former.
These likely represent areas of infarction.
Since the patient has multiple areas of possible infarcts, a central source of embolization is suggested and further workup might be considered.
LENIS [**3-9**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
Imaging of the right side could not be performed.
There is hypodensity in the right periatrial region extending to the subcortical region predominantly in the white matter distribution.

CT ANGIOGRAPHY: CT angiography of the neck demonstrates vascular  calcification at both carotid bifurcations.
There is approximately 60% stenosis at the proximal left internal carotid artery.
Both vertebral arteries demonstrate calcification in the distal portion but appear patent in the neck.
The right carotid artery demonstrates vascular calcifications but no evidence of stenosis.
The intracranial arteries demonstrates no vascular stenosis or occlusion.
There are calcifications with mild narrowing and atherosclerotic disease of both supraclinoid and cavernous carotid arteries.
In the visualized lung, bilateral pleural effusions and atelectatic changes are seen.

TTE [**2180-3-14**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is definitely seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.

EEG ([**2180-3-28**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to unsustained runs of rhythmic theta/delta activity with sharp features in the R>L central regions.
This finding is concerning for cortical irritability in these regions and potential for seizure activity.
Additionally, the background was slow, disorganized, and interrupted by bursts of generalized suppression consistent with a severe encephalopathy.

MRSA SCREENS: [**3-9**], [**3-13**], [**3-20**], [**3-27**] negative   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year-old man with a history including CAD, s/p CABG complicated by post-op a. fib for which coumadin was started, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and GI bleed secondary to a duodenal ulcer who initially presented to [**Hospital1 6685**] and [**Hospital3 **] Centers with headache and neck pain and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after he was found to have predominantely intraventricular hemorrhage (possibly caudate origin) and multiple ischemic strokes in the setting of anticoagulation reversal and medical cardioversion.
His pre-transfer course was additionally complicated by either flash pulmonary edema or TRALI, secondary to 4 units of FFP, and required intubation.
He has been followed by serial CT scans and was noted on [**3-7**] to have developed a new area of hypodensity concerning for an new infarct.
Over the next two days he was noted to develop more infarcts concerning for an embolic focus.
His exam was notable for a left field cut, otherwise intact cranial nerves, symmetric and non-focal motor exam, and bilateral upgoing toes.
Given the history after his bleed occurred and the patient's INR was reversed, coupled with the episode of a.fib and the conversion back to sinus may very likely be the embolic cause of his multiple strokes.
The etiology of his initial intraventicular bleed was thought to be perhaps secondary to amyloid angiopathy vs. AVM.
To evaluate for vascular contributions to the presenting syndrome, he underwent carotid ultrasound.
While the study showed insignificant stenosis on the left, the internal jugular line placement precluded visualization of the right internal carotid artery.
He subsequently underwent CTA of the head and neck which showed 60% stenosis at the proximal left ICA.
There were vascular calcifications but no evidence of stenosis in the right ICA.
The imaging demonstrated unchanged intraventricular blood and stable ventriculomegaly.
Given persistently waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, an EEG was performed to evaluate for seizure activity.
The background was slow, disorganized, and interrupted by bursts of generalized suppression consistent with a severe encephalopathy.
He was found to have copious secretions, fever, leukocytosis, and underwent bronchoscopy which showed thick mucous plugging and positive gram positive cocci.
As his echocardiogram prior to transfer was suggestive of a right-to-left shunt, he underwent a CTA chest which was negative for pulmonary embolism.
The following morning the patient became hypoxic, agitated, and restless.
He was found to have RLL collapse, possibly secondary to mucous plugging although no clear source was found on bronchoscopy and the patient required re-intubation [**3-15**].
He has continued to have low grade temperatures despite standing tylenol as well as a mild leukocytosis.
Two bottles from blood cultures drawn [**3-15**] grew GPC in clusters, as well as from [**3-17**].
On [**3-21**], after multiple sets of cultures returned negative, the vancomycin, cefepime, levoquin and flagyl were discontinued, and he was just continued on vancomycin for the positive blood cultures.
An echocardiogram here was a limited study but notable for normal ejection fraction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and no evidence of ASD or PFO (was notable on TEE but not TTE prior to transfer).
On [**3-21**] he was noted to be mildly fluid overloaded, and was started on standing Lasix.
ABD/GI: In the setting of positive for Hepatitis C in serology, the patient's LFTs were stable.
No active source of bleeding was identified.
As the sodium normalized, free water with tube feeds was gradually increased to address intravascular volume depletion.
VASCULAR: Given the persistent fevers, the patient underwent lower extremity ultrasound which showed no evidence of thrombosis.
