Admission Date:  [**2110-12-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-1-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2045-3-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Known firstname 1711**] Chief Complaint: Sustained stable VT  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VT ablation   History of Present Illness: 65M with a history of inferior posterior MI s/p three vessel CABG in [**2094**] with a large residual scar and recurrent VT s/p VT ablation on [**2110-12-18**] and discharged from the CCU service on [**2110-12-21**] who presents with recurrent symptomatic VT.
He reports that he started having a feeling of palpitations and increased DOE and SOB even at rest starting at some point on Saturday.
Today when he reported these symptoms to his cardiologist, he was referred to the [**Hospital1 **] ED.
In the ED there he was in and out of VT. His pacer was interrogated with showed recurrent VT ongoing with some ATP and 18 continuous hours of VT on Saturday.
He was symptomatic, but not syncopal or presyncopal.
He complains of mild cough and a sensation that he cannot take a deep breath.
Otherwise, he has no complaints.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: - Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: CAD, inferior lateral posterior MI treated with thrombolytics in [**2094-3-9**] complicated by ventricular tachycardia, subsequent three-vessel CABG in [**2094-3-9**] at [**Hospital1 18**].
-PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: None -PACING/ICD: AICD implantation for ventricular tachycardia in [**2094-6-9**] at [**Hospital1 18**], generator placement in [**2098**] upgraded device due to battery depletion in [**2106-6-10**] with [**Company 1543**] AICD and new RV lead placement.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with evidence of inappropriate firing of defibrillator.
- Hypercholesterolemia.
- Moderate mitral regurgitation.
- Mild obesity.
- Obstructive sleep apnea treated with CPAP.
No thrills, lifts.
No S3 or S4 but difficult to assess given rate CHEST: Well healed midline sternotomy and left pacer scars LUNGS: Bilateral crackles 1/4 up the lung fields ABDOMEN: BS+, overweight, soft, nondistended, no HSM.
EXTREMITIES: 1+ pretibial edema to mid calf BL, no venous stasis changes.
There is moderate cardiomegaly.
Hilar and mediastinal contours are stable with a tortuous thoracic aorta.
There is mild increase in the interstitial markings, suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
The pleural surfaces are smooth without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
The retrocardiac left lung base atelectasis has improved.
Stable moderate cardiomegaly, with mild pulmonary congestion.
No evidence of pneumonia.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Mild cardiomegaly and a slightly tortuous aorta are unchanged.
Minimal pulmonary venous engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
EKG [**2110-12-30**]: Ventricular tachycardia with a fusion beat.
Brief Hospital Course: 65M with CAD s/p MI and CABG, CHF, HTN, HLD, VT s/p prior ablation and recent placement of an [**Company 1543**] AICD initially admitted to the floor, but transferred to the CCU with stable, perfusing VT, refractory to lidocaine for VT ablation procedure.
# RHYTHM: On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient was in a perfusing ventricular tachycardia rhythm with BP 101/72 and rate in 130's.
On HD2 his rhythm alternated between slow, perfusing VT and sinus rhythm.
# Blood pressure control: While in the CCU, his BPs were borderline hypotensive, so it was not aggressively controled and he was given B-blockers as tolerated.
# PUMP: Chronic congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction, EF 30%.
On admission, patient showed signs of failure related to poor forward flow while in sustained ventricular tachycardia.
With improved rhythm control, volume status improved.
# CORONARIES: CAD s/p MI and CABG x3 in [**2094**].
No concern for ischemia on this admission.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Ventricular tachycardia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You presented for management of recurrent ventricular tachycardia and were admitted to the CCU for close monitoring.
