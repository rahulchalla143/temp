Since that time he has felt mich better but recent echo showed severe aortic stenosis and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Past Medical History: Coronary artery disease s/p Coronary Artery Bypass Graft [**2127**] & [**2137**] (PTCA/stent to SVG to PDA graft [**2-17**]), Atrial fibrillation, Cardiomyopathy, Hyperlipidemia, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, Hypertension, GI bleed, Renal insufficiency PSH: Cholecystectomy, Back Surgery, Nasal Surgery, Eye Surgery  Social History: Currently smokes [**7-19**] cigs/day and 1ppd since at 18.
Family History: Father with valve problems died at age 54.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen with bilateral leaflet retraction and a central jet.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position with trivial AI.
Significant air in esophagus with poor acoustic windows post bypass.
There is calcification along the diaphragm.
This can be seen as sign of asbestos exposure.
The patient is status post sternotomy, with prosthetic valve.
There is moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly.
There is parenchymal scarring.
There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle posteriorly and a small amount of pleural fluid or thickening along the right costophrenic angle.
Also, minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
A small air-filled locule abuts the left mid chest question small bleb or bulla.
The wall appears more thickened than on [**2150-5-21**] and attention to this area on followup films to exclude a developing infection is requested.
Doubt CHF or focal infiltrate.
On [**5-19**] he was brought to the operating room where he underwent a redo-sternotomy x 2, coronary artery bypass graft x 1, mitral valve repair, aortic valve replacement, and over sewing of left atrial appendage.
Early post-op day three he had episodes of atrial fibrillation but anticoagulation was not initiated due to his GI bleeding history.
