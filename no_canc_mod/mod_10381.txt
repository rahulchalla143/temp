HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient had recent worsening of dyspnea on exertion over the past two years with a history of shortness of breath times two years and positive exercise tolerance test with a small inferior defect.
A cardiac catheterization done on [**2119-8-17**] showed normal coronary arteries with an ejection fraction of 84%, a dilated ascending aorta to 5 cm and no aortic insufficiency.
A chest CT scan done on [**2119-8-26**] also confirmed a dilated ascending aorta.
Osteoporosis with osteoarthritis.
ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father died of cancer; he also had heart disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Prior to admission, the patient had a heart rate of 91, a blood pressure of 146/84, a respiratory rate of 20, a height of 5 feet 5 inches and a weight of 180 pounds.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, there was no jugular venous distention.
There were no nodes.
There was a short, obese neck.
The neck was supple with no carotid bruits.
The heart had an S1 and S2 with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen was obese, soft, nontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
There was a well healed abdominal scar.
In the extremities, there were healed right femoral calf scars with no hematoma.
There were varicosities of the right and left legs lateral to the knees.
There was no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
There was no venous stasis.
There were a 2+ right femoral pulse and 1+ left femoral pulse.
There were a 2+ right dorsalis pedis pulse and a 2+ left dorsalis pedis pulse.
There were a 2+ right radial pulse and a 2+ left radial pulse.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2119-9-12**], the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**], where she underwent repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm.
However, she remained somewhat hypoxic and for that reason she remained intubated.
By chest x-ray, the patient exhibited signs of pulmonary edema.
The patient continued to have marginal blood gases.
On postoperative day #7, she underwent bronchoscopy, which showed hyperemic and friable airways.
Also on postoperative day #7, the patient began to have sternal drainage.
Her wound culture grew out Pseudomonas and at that time she was started on vancomycin, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin.
Her radial arterial line was also discontinued and the culture of the tip of that line grew out Staphylococcus epidermidis.
On postoperative day #9, the patient experienced several episodes of respiratory distress, which ultimately required reintubation.
On postoperative day #10, the patient continued to have sternal drainage.
The patient returned to the operating room, at which time her sternal incision was opened, explored and debrided.
It was felt at that time that this was a superficial sternal wound infection.
Her sternum was rewired and the wound was left open with packing.
On the following day, the wound had no drainage and was sutured closed.
Over several days postoperatively from her re-exploration, she was again diuresed and slowly weaned from full ventilatory support to pressure support ventilation with decreasing amounts of PEEP and pressure support.
On postoperative day #16 from her initial surgery and postoperative day #6 from her re-wiring, the patient had a bump in her white blood cell count.
Unfortunately, the patient developed a pneumothorax immediately following placement of the left subclavian line.
A chest x-ray following placement of the left chest tube showed a resolved pneumothorax.
She tolerated the extubation well and, over the next several days, remained in the intensive care unit to monitor her respiratory status while she continued to be diuresed and weaned from her oxygen support.
The patient's postoperative course was again complicated by periods of atrial fibrillation.
On postoperative day #26 from her initial surgery and postoperative day #17 from her re-exploration, it was deemed that the patient was ready for transfer to a rehabilitation center for continuing rehabilitation and postoperative care.
Status post ascending aortic aneurysm repair.
On respiratory examination, there are scattered rhonchi bilaterally with decreased breath sounds bilaterally in the bases.
The sternum has sutures healing well with no drainage.
The abdomen is soft, nontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
The extremities are warm and well perfused with no edema.
There is a 4 x 4 cm ecchymotic area at the site of her left chest tube.
