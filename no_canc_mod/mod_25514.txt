The patient was at his rehab facility and noted increasing discomfort at his right lower extremity with diminishing sensation at the foot and some limitation of motor function.
He was consented, after initial performance of angiogram demonstrating severe aorta occlusive disease  Past Medical History: # COPD (unknown PFTs) # Fatty liver (presumed [**2-4**] alcohol) # Gastritis (never had upper EGD, never had colonoscopy) # H/o NSVT (3-4 beat run while admitted in [**3-11**]) # H/o tonsillectomy # Left total hip replacement [**2-/2110**]   Social History: Quit smoking and etoh in [**3-11**].

Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Small pericardial effusion.
Findings described above, likely represent resolving small bowel obstruction.
New bilateral moderate pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis, less likely underlying infectious process.
Mesenteric edema which may be post-surgical in nature.
Focal opacities in the right lateral lower lobe and lingula may represent atelectasis vs infection, however malignancy is not necessarily excluded.
KUB [**2111-4-22**]: Progression of duodenal and proximal jejunal small bowel distention worrisome for evolving proximal small-bowel obstruction.
Bilateral pulmonary emboli without evidence of right heart strain.
Patchy peripheral opacities in the right middle and lower lobes, suspicious for infection.
Lymphangitic spread of disease may also have this appearance.
Marked interval increase in size of pulmonary nodules and bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy with interval development or right pleural and pericardial effusions.
Given this constellation of findings is highly concerning for malignancy; lymphoma and metastases should be considered, although the differential includes sarcoidosis, or cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis.
Recommend correlation with bronchoscopic biopsy.
Significantly decreased distention of previously noted dilated loop of small bowel suggesting resolution of partial small bowel obstruction or ileus.
Dilated proximal CBD up to 9-mm with mildly prominent right hepatic duct, new since the last CT study dated [**2111-4-19**].
While no cholelithiasis or proximal choledocholithiasis is directly observed, obstruction at the distal CBD cannot be excluded.
Slightly echogenic liver compatible with known fatty liver.
No focal hepatic lesions.
[**2111-4-30**] CT abd: High-grade small-bowel obstruction with transition point in the left mid abdomen given the swirling appearance of the vessels/bowel loops is concerning for internal hernia or volvulus.
No evidence of free air.

Diet was advance and pain was controlled.
The right foot was monitored [**Doctor Last Name **] closely for signs of improvement.
After several it became very clear, that the right foot was not going to recover.
The patient underwent R BKA on [**2111-4-6**], which again went well without complication.
However, on POD2 after the BKA, patient became hypotensive with SBP in the 80-90s.
As such, cardiology was consulted and they recommended getting an ECHO to rule out heart issues.
However, patient's oxygen requirement had increased, although he denied any shortness of breath.
However, the patient became supratherapeutic initially, and coumadin was held, and then the INR dropped to subtherapeutic levels, likely due to improved nutrition.
The patient's Chest CT scan also showed enlarging pulmonary nodules with mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy.
However, several days after the R BKA, patient began to have more distension in his abdomen with worsening pain.
Repeat CT scan showed improvement in the SBO, but KUB showed persistent dilated loop of small bowel.
On the following day , he became nauseous and had multiple bouts of vomiting.
An Abdomina XR was done that showed dilated bowel loops.
It revealed a 9 mm CBD with no e/o stones in the CBD or gall bladder.
A CT abdomen with PO contrast was done which showed high grade small bowel obstruction.
On [**2111-5-12**], the patient obtained a RUQ ultrasound for evaluation of rising alkaline phosphatase levels, which demonstrated gallbladder sludge without notable change in intrahepatic duct size and the same extrahepatic duct size.
He had low grade fevers initially after his bypass procedure, but these initially resolved after his BKA.
At time of discharge, the patient was comfortable, pain was well-controlled.
