NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):     ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):     ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2117-7-14**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
PERICARDIUM: Small to moderate pericardial effusion.
Significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w impaired ventricular filling.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
Focal right ventricular diastolic compression is seen in the subcostal view but is not present in the apical and parasternal views (this may represent focal/early tamponade).
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA PERICARDIUM: Moderate pericardial effusion.
No RA or RV diastolic collapse.
Significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w impaired ventricular filling.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling, although frank cardiac tamponade is not present.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no evidence of post-procedure pneumothorax.
Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged.
No definite vascular congestion or acute pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 29 yo M w/ no significant PMH presented with pleuritic chest pain and syncope (likely vasovagal) and was found to have a pericardial effusion with a Pulsus of 12 and early tamponade physiology on TTE who underwent successful pericardiocentesis with improved chest pressure.
He has multiple labs on the pericardial fluid still pending at the time of discharge.
As he had a significant effusion it was decided to drain it rather than monitor with serial TTE.
He was instructed what to look out for in terms of signs of tamponade or worsening effusion.
-discharged on colchicine and ibuprofen -will f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of cardiology to determine course of treatment -Multiple pericarld fluid studies are still pending  #Syncope- patient had syncope on admission and it was in teh setting of pain, and therefore likely due to a vasovagal event as opposed to his pericardial effusion.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 63724**], You were admitted to the hospital after you had passed out, and you were found to have a pericardial effusion (fluid within the sac surrounding your heart).
You were monitored in the Cardiac intensive care unit and had this fluid drained.
The exact cause of the increase in fluid is still not clear but likely was due to inflammation in the sac called the pericardium.
We started you on two medications that you will need to continue as an outpatient to treat your pericarditis.
Colchicine 0.6mg by mouth once a day to help with inflammation around the heart.
