Admission Date:  [**2184-8-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-8-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2115-1-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Allergies/ADRs on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - Intubation - Lumbar puncture   History of Present Illness: 68F with recent diagnosis of Stage IIB melanoma ([**4-/2184**]) s/p excision and axillary lymph node dissection ([**5-/2184**]), on interferon x 4 weeks, who presents with acute onset altered mental status.
On morning of admission, she drove to gynecology office for appointment where she had "confusion" such as not remembering medications or the date.
She was not following commands, with no focal motor deficits.
CT and CTA show no evidence of ischemia or hemorrhage.
An LP was performed and VDRL and Borrelia labs sent.
EKG showed RBBB TWI Avl, V1-[**Street Address(2) 89153**] depressions and no peaking of T waves.
CXR showed no evidence of cardiopulmonary process.
Per husband, patient has had no flulike symptoms, no recent travel or sick contacts, and notes she only experienced constipation about 3 days ago for which she took 3 x 250 mg Mg pills.
Past Medical History: Melanoma s/p resection and left axillary node dissection Hyperlipidemia DJD Hormone Replacement Therapy Menopausal Osteopenia Insomnia Constipation s/p breast biopsy s/p laparoscopic hysterectomy s/p right shoulder surgery s/p cataract extraction  Social History: Active up until a few months before dx of melanoma.
Her mother had esophageal cancer.
Heart: normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Lungs: CTA bilaterally Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended Skin: well-healed diagonal scar on left shoulder, no edema Ext: moving all extremities, no focal deficits  DISCHARGE EXAM: GENERAL: Frail female resting in bed in NAD.
COR: + S1S2 RRR no m/g/r.
There is no focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute ischemic event and the principal intracranial vascular flow-voids, including those of the dural venous sinuses, are preserved, and these structures enhance normally.
There is no pathologic focus of parenchymal, leptomeningeal, r dural enhancement to suggest intracranial metastatic disease.
There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, the midline structures are in the midline, and the ventricles and cisterns are normal in size and configuration (for age).
There is a multifocal round and ovoid, as well as confluent FLAIR-hyperintensity, relatively symmetrically distributed in bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white matter; this likely represents the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no space-occupying lesion, and the sella, parasellar region, and remainder of the skull base are unremarkable.
There is evidence of bilateral ocular lens surgery, but the orbits are otherwise unremarkable.
There is minimal mucosal thickening involving the anterior ethmoidal air cells, right more than left, with otherwise clear visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells.
The regional bone marrow signal is unremarkable, with no osseous destructive lesion identified.
Incidentally noted is a small 6.5-mm ill-defined lesion in the left parietovertex scalp subcutaneous soft tissues (10:22, 901:100), which likely represents an incidental sebaceous cyst.
No acute intracranial process, including no evidence of acute ischemia.
No pathologic focus of enhancement to suggest intracranial metastatic disease.
Multifocal punctate and confluent FLAIR-hyperintensity in bihemispheric white matter, as detailed, likely the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Given the distribution as well as the lack of contrast enhancement, this is unlikely to represent acute demyelination, such as that related to interferon therapy.
The confluent involvement of deep, periventricular white matter, as well as the lack of enhancement, would also argue against PRES, though this should be correlated with evidence of (even relative) hypertension, particularly during the period of interferon therapy.
DISCHARGE LABS:  [**2184-8-12**] 03:40AM BLOOD WBC-6.3 RBC-3.34* Hgb-10.4* Hct-29.8* MCV-89 MCH-31.2 MCHC-34.9 RDW-13.3 Plt Ct-150 [**2184-8-13**] 08:45AM BLOOD Na-140 K-3.6 Cl-106 [**2184-8-13**] 08:45AM BLOOD Calcium-8.9 Phos-2.4* Mg-2.2  Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: 69F with hyperlipidemia, osteopenia, menopausal syndrome on HRT, with recent diagnosis of melanoma on interferon alpha presenting with altered mental status  ACUTE DIAGNOSES: # Altered Mental Status / Encephalopathy: Patient was admitted with acute confusion.
She underwent CT, CTA, MRI (which required intubation), that suggested no evidence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, or metastatic disease.
She did have posterior white matter changes.
CXR showed no cardiopulmonary process.
She was seen by neurology and underwent a 24 hour EEG, which revealed no focus for seizure.
PTH found to be elevated at 131.
Severe hypophosphatemia can lead to metabolic encephalopathy.
Patient's tachypnea at presentation suggests likely acute respiratory alkalosis in field and worsened by ventilation that can also lead to hypophosphatemia.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: #Hyperlipidemia: Patient was continued on Simvastatin 10 mg PO qSun, Wed, Fri.  #Melanoma: Patient has Stage IIB melanoma s/p resection, 4 weeks IFN-alpha and was about to begin 11 week course of self-administration.
No evidence of brain metastasis.

5. ibuprofen 400 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H prn as needed for pain for 1 doses.
Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO QHS PRN as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: - Altered mental status  SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: - Melanoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 89154**], you were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because you were slightly confused while driving and you had an episode of unresponsiveness.
Your MRI did show an abnormality in the grey & white matter at the back of your brain; it is possible that this is due to interferon.
As such, you were safe to be discharged home with no new medications.
If, however, you feel dizzy or confused, please seek medical attention.
