HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Sixty-year old female with history of CAD status post CABG, end-stage CHF on chronic dopamine, status post biventricular pacer with an EF of 20%, a transthoracic echocardiogram on [**11/2127**] and diabetes mellitus.
Recently admitted on [**7-2**] to [**7-3**] for bacteremia, coag-negative Staph, plus Stenotrophomonas, who presents complaining of diarrhea x2 days, also with positive fevers up to about 102.
Pertinent details of her previous hospitalization include a similar presentation with diarrhea and fevers.
The decision was made with ID to not to treat her systematically and to leave her Hickman line intact.
Husband noted that patient was weak and unable to get out of bed this morning and was lightheaded.
Had diarrhea with mild abdominal cramping, no nausea, no vomiting, nonbloody.
No change in diet.
[**Name (NI) **] chest pain, shortness of breath, or dysuria.
States that she has occasional calf pain with no swelling.
Noninvasive cuff correlates with manual readings.
CAD status post CABG in [**2120**], redo in [**2123**].
MR, CHF on chronic dopamine drip, status post biventricular pacer in '[**23**].
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Diabetes mellitus.
Peripheral vascular disease.
History of coag-negative Staph line infection.
Prosthetic mechanical mitral valve, requiring coumadin anticoagulation 8.
Recurrent atrial reentrant tachyarrhythmia, managed with recent pacer revision to atrial tachycardia devise HOME MEDICATIONS: 1.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Cardiovascular:  She had a metallic sound, more of a systolic murmur best heard on her apex.
Strength is [**3-22**] throughout, no focal deficits.
EKG was AV sequentially paced, left bundle branch block, rate 81, normal QRS axis, no ST-T wave changes.
Chest x-ray:  No acute redistribution of flow.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  For CAD, no acute issues at this point.
Her beta blockers and ACE initially were held in the setting of low blood pressures.
Her picture was most likely a mix between a cardiogenic component and a distributive secondary to sepsis.
She had an acute renal failure on top of her chronic renal insufficiency likely related to her hypovolemia which had resolved upon her discharge and possibly secondary to her diarrhea in setting of chronic requirement for diuretics.
Her fevers were likely secondary to infection of the Hickman based on previous admission.
We will need to clarify at time with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for possible plans for her central access.
We are still holding the beta blockers until volume status stabilizes.
In terms of her ID status, she was continued on her Vancomycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl, and Zosyn for broad coverage, and ID was consulted for further input.
She remained afebrile meanwhile and lungs were clear.
They noted that if the patient became symptomatic, then it is necessary there might be a need for a high risk surgical change in the line.
Later on in the course on [**8-9**], patient also grew gram-positive cocci in clusters, which later on grew to be a Staphylococcus aureus.
If blood sterilization is not accomplished, the Hickman line may in future need to  per Surgery's continued involvement balancing high risk / benefit.
Patient was instructed to return to clinic if symptoms return or new symptoms arise or seek medical attention as needed.
Seek medical attention for fever, diarrhea, increased shortness of breath, or hypertension.
End-stage congestive heart failure.
Acute and transient renal failure.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Prosthetic mitral valve.
Atrial tachyarrhythmias status post ablation attempt, now with pacer revision to atrial tachycardia device 8.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
