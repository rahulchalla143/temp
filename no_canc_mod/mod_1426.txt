Admission Date:  [**2172-6-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-6-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-5-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Dyazide / Prozac / Nsaids / Inderal / Cefazolin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1384**] Chief Complaint: AV graft placement needed for dialysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: placement of left upper extremity graft for dialysis   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 12067**] is a 68 year-old woman with end stage renal disease who has a failed kidney transplant.
There is a subclavian stenosis on the right side and so this side was not thought to be usable.
However, these were up at almost the level of the chest wall and given her previous grafts on the left side we felt that a high left upper extremity graft would be her best option.
ESRD s/p cadaveric renal transplant in [**2168**] back on HD at [**Location (un) 4265**] [**Location (un) **] (M,W,F) 2.
DM2  last HbA1c [**11-29**] is 10.6% - w/ retinopathy, nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy 3.
Hyperlipidemia 4. s/p CVA 5.
CAD s/p cath [**2-26**]- LAD 50% stenosis, RCA 60% and mild diastolic dysfunction.
Family History: Father w/ DM and mother w/ HTN.
The kidney transplant is      nontender and palpable in the right lower quadrant.
EXT: She has no pedal edema or suspicious skin lesions.

AP CHEST FROM 11:09 P.M. [**6-2**]  HISTORY: End-stage renal disease and respiratory distress.
Consolidation in the infrahilar right lung has improved since 3:00 p.m. indicating this is likely atelectasis.
Severe cardiac silhouette enlargement is unchanged.
The tips of a dual channel supraclavicular right central venous catheter project over the SVC and superior cavoatrial junction respectively.
No pneumothorax.
REASON FOR EXAM: Assess for aspiration, 64-year-old woman with ESRD with respiratory distress.
FINDINGS: There is retrocardiac left base opacity concerning for aspirative consolidation new from prior study.
Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
Right infrahilar opacity is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Left retrocardiac consolidation consistent with an aspirative process  Findings were discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the mom[**Name (NI) **] of the interpretation of the study.
Compared with [**2172-6-4**], there has been some interval clearing at the left lung base, with improvement and only minimal residual retrocardiac patchy density.
No CHF or other evidence of consolidation or effusion.
Minimal subsegmental atelectasis at the right base.
UNILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed of the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, basilic, brachial, and cephalic veins and the left subclavian vein.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
Patient technically had fine placement of Left AV graft; however, during procedure patient had respiratory compromise/airway edema and was intubated.
Patient noted to have elevated troponinsX3 as above s/p airway management.
Patient stayed overnight in PACU with anesthesia monitoring patient.
Patient had facial swelling and renal was initially consulted on [**6-2**] postop.
They concurred with surgeon's evaluation that patient had become hypercarbic and tachypnic during OR and thought the angioedema was most likely to drug allergic reaction secondary to no pulmonary edema on CXR.
The patient did vomit and aspirated in PACU and developed retrocardiac infiltrates concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
Patient was transferred to floor but noted to be hypersomnolent and subsequently had low oxygen saturation secondary to suspected ativan/oxycodone even on 100%nonrebreather mask.
Pt transferred back to floor ([**Hospital Ward Name **] 7) on [**2172-6-5**] and patient improved gradually, was hemodialyzed per renal recommendations, her diet was advanced as tolerated, and eventually was discharged on home meds as above with diabetes management [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] consult recommendations which were the same as her prehospital insulin.
[**Name8 (MD) **] MD or come to Er if having worsening pains, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting or if there are any questions or concerns.
