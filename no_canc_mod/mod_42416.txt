):  This is a 45-year-old gentleman, with past medical history significant for a CVA secondary to [**Hospital1 7344**] abuse, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic severe hypertension, admitted on [**2120-2-21**] with severe GI bleed.
The patient was also found to have acute renal failure with a creatinine of 4.3.
On the evening of admission, he began to have bilateral lower extremity shaking with rare upper extremity movement.
A neuro consultation was obtained, and the patient was loaded with Dilantin, although a seizure disorder, or seizure activity were felt to be very low on the differential.
In the early morning on the day following admission, the patient required intubation to control multiple aspects of his medical situation including extreme hypertension, respiratory distress, and the need for sedation secondary to ongoing violent shaking of his extremities.
Later in the day, on [**2120-2-22**], an EGD was performed which showed red blood in the stomach and second part of the duodenum.
An ulcer in the duodenum was treated with epinephrine injection and thermal therapy.
The patient was given multiple transfusions in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with an appropriate increase in his hematocrit.
On admission, the patient was found to have cardiac enzymes which were positive for myocardial infarction.
A head CT was obtained on [**2-22**] which showed no acute changes from previous studies.
EEG performed on [**2-23**] showed slowing consistent with encephalopathy.
Biopsy obtained during the EGD returned on [**2-26**] positive for H. pylori, and the patient was started on treatment.
On [**2-29**], the patient was successfully extubated, but then later developed copious secretions with respiratory distress requiring reintubation.
On that day, he also began to have fever spikes in the 101s.
Sputum culture from [**2120-3-2**] grew gram-positive cocci in pairs.
Able to answer yes and no questions.
Unable to perform extraocular movements, although this does appear secondary to understanding.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
CHEST X-RAY (AT THAT TIME):  Showed unchanged linear bilateral bibasilar atelectasis without focal consolidation.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE ON [**Hospital1 **] FIRM - 1) FEVER: The patient had first began spiking fevers on [**2120-2-29**].
Sinusitis was considered to be the most likely source, given copious yellow/green respiratory secretions.
Over the next few days, the patient became afebrile, and has been afebrile since that time.
Medications were adjusted for better hypertensive control.
3) GI BLEED:  The patient was found to have a bleeding duodenal ulcer, for which he was treated during the EGD.
His hematocrit has been stable and within range since that time with no active bleeding.
At this time, pulmonary is being consulted, and there is consideration to remove the patient's tracheostomy.
5) ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  It was thought that the patient had an anoxic brain injury during his episode of severe anemia and hypertension in the Emergency Department on presentation.
Over the course of 3 weeks on the floor, the patient has made significant improvement while working with speech therapy.
6) RENAL FAILURE:  In treating the patient and following his creatinine, it appears that he has some baseline renal dysfunction secondary to his severe chronic hypertension and diabetes.
As an ACE inhibitor was added to control his blood pressure, his creatinine was followed closely, but did not have a significant long-term increase.
After discussing the jerking movements of his extremities with them, reviewing imaging data, and reviewing findings of the EEG, it appeared very unlikely that the patient had had a seizure, or had any sort of underlying seizure disorder.
8) TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient had good blood sugar control throughout his admission to the [**Hospital1 139**] Firm.
However, he underwent a speech and swallow study and was cleared to take thickened liquids and purees without risk of aspiration.
