History is very limited due to her acuity and is mostly from EMS and outside hospital.
The patient presented with acute onset dyspnea, tachycardia, and was very tachypneic.
She is presently  acidotic in cardiogenic shock, intubated, sedated on  Levophed and Neo.

Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small, hyperdynamic left ventricle.
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Mitral valve prolapse with at least moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate aortic stenosis.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2178-2-16**], severity of mitral regurgitation has probably worsened and right ventricle is now hypocontractile.
This study might be significantly UNDERestimating the severity of eccentric mitral regurgitation and if there is clinical concern for acute severe mitral regurgitation, a transesophageal study is recommended.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Cardiomegaly with marked left atrial enlargement.
Bilateral diffuse ground glass opacity and interlobular and intralobular septal thickening suggests severe pulmonary edema.
More consolidative areas within the lower lobes bilaterally may be due to pneumonia or atelectasis.
Small to moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions, left larger than right.
Severely elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures.
[**2183-7-20**] intra-op echo Prebypass  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
with severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
Unable to calculate gradients and [**Location (un) 109**] due to poor doppler alignment in the deep transgastric views.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is partial mitral leaflet flail.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Post bypass  Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of norepinephrine, epinephrine and milrinone.
Trace central aortic insufficiency present.
There is a bioprosthetic valve seen in the mitral position.
Echo [**2183-7-31**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of fluid collections or abscess.
New right pectoral hematoma.
Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Small pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 year old female with a history of [**Doctor Last Name 27210**] syndrome and aortic stenosis with bicuspid aortic valve who presents with respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock.
Echo revealed severe MR and severe AS with a bicuspid aortic valve.
Post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU for further invasive monitoring in critical condition.
Post-operatively, she developed rapid atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability and was electrically cardioverted.
A Lasix drip was initiated to aggressively diurese her excessive volume overload.
Due to right upper extremity swelling a right upper extremity ultrasound was performed and negative for thrombus.Left thoracentesis done on [**7-30**].
Dobhoff placed for tube feeds for increased nutritional needs and poor intake.
She continued to progress and was transferred to the step down unit.On POD#17 A 700cc left pleural effusion was evacuated via repeat thoracentesis.
