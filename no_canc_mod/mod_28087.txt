Admission Date:  [**2146-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-4-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-6-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**] Chief Complaint: s/p self inflicted stab wound to abdomen  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**4-12**] Exploratory laparotomy   History of Present Illness: 25 yo male who is s/p self inflicted stab wound to the abdomen.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval dilation/distension INDICATION: 25-year-old man with recent stab wound and abdominal distention.
No intra- abdominal free air is identified.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of multiple dilated loops of large bowel and small bowel.
Differential diagnosis includes ileus versus partial small-bowel obstruction.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Self-inflicted stab wounds to abdomen, as well as right liver lobe laceration.
PROCEDURE:  Exploratory laparotomy and right liver lobe laceration repair (hepatorrhaphy).
He was tachycardiac and after 2 liters of fluid boluses was still tachycardiac, as well as a finding on formal ultrasound FAST examination showing free fluid within Morison pouch.
Preprocedural time-out was done, and then using a #10 blade an incision was made about 3 cm below the xiphoid process in the midline, through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, taking it and curving around to the left of the umbilicus and down another 3 cm below the umbilicus in the midline sharply.
Sharp dissection with the 10 blade was used to take the subcutaneous fat and tissues down to the midline fascia, and this was cleared off, and then the midline fascia was entered with the knife directly in the midline.
Some blood was noted to be coming from the peritoneum once we opened, but there was no major collection of blood that we could see initially.
We did focus in on the right upper quadrant to begin with, and we did note in a tangential trajectory from the larger of the 2 stab wounds this communicated with the abdominal fascia and appeared to penetrate the liver, making an approximately 1.5 cm long laceration, the depth of which could not be definitively determined but probably on the order of 2 cm.
These were removed, and then under direct visualization we inspected the entire abdominal cavity including the stomach, the spleen, the transverse mesocolon and transverse colon, and then in a systematic fashion we ran the small bowel from the ligament of Treitz all the way to the ileocecal valve.
No other intra-abdominal injuries were able to be seen including the mesentery of the small bowel as well.
Gastroduodenal ligament was also inspected, and no obvious lacerations or injuries were seen there.
We did have some bleeding from the underlying fascia and abdominal wall where the stab incisions were, and we did put 3 figure-of-eight 2-0 Vicryl sutures there for hemostasis which controlled that well.
The fascia was closed with #1 looped PDS starting at both the superior and inferior apices of the fascial incision working our way in the midline, taking 1 cm bites 1 cm apart for the entire course of the fascia and then tied-down in the midline.
The 2 stab wounds were irrigated copiously and then closed loosely but reapproximated using one 3-0 nylon for the smaller stab wound which was approximately 0.5 cm in size and the second one that was medial to this which penetrated into the intra-abdominal cavity, as discussed previously, was closed with two 3-0 nylon sutures, reapproximating the wound which was approximately 1.5 cm in length.
General anesthesia was given.
No implants or devices were placed.

Hemodynamically he remained stable; he did however have some abdominal distention that was noted several days postoperatively.
He did have some issues surrounding tachycardia, serial ECG's revealed sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes noted.
He was started on Ativan for anxiety and also for CIWA.
