Last year he was found to have a 4.4-cm hepatocellular carcinoma.
He has undergone chemoembolization followed by radiofrequency ablation of a Segment VI lesion.
A repeat CT of the abdomen and chest on [**2128-2-25**] demonstrated no evidence of tumor recurrence at the ablation site and no evidence of new or concerning lesions elsewhere in the liver or lungs.
No recent infections or illnesses.
Past Medical History: Cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C (diagnosed [**2119**]) as well as alcohol use - attempted treatment with interferon and ribavirin, but only on it for a couple of weeks at 1/3 of the normal dosage and experienced thrombocytopenia and stopped - decompensated with a variceal bleed in [**2121**]/[**2122**] - status post splenorenal shunt Hepatocellular carcinoma - s/p chemoembolization on [**2127-7-9**], at [**Hospital3 2358**].
History of a right leg fracture and a left leg fracture   Social History: Currently living with a friend and is separated from his second wife.
No history of IVDU.
Family History: Dad - died at age 70 of CAD and CVA Mom - aged 83 and healthy Brother and Sister - both healthy Denies family history of liver disease, liver cancer or colon cancer   Physical Exam: 96.6 88 160/100 18 97RA A&Ox4 No jaundice Neck no lymphadenopathy Lungs: CTAB Heart: RRR Abd: soft, nt, no hernias Ext: no edema Skin: psoriasis patches and vitiligo on his hands   Pertinent Results: [**2128-4-19**] 08:14AM BLOOD WBC-3.6* RBC-3.45* Hgb-12.8* Hct-35.2* MCV-102*# MCH-37.0* MCHC-36.3* RDW-15.3 Plt Ct-96* [**2128-4-19**] 08:14AM BLOOD PT-16.2* PTT-33.9 INR(PT)-1.4* [**2128-4-19**] 08:14AM BLOOD Glucose-144* UreaN-8 Creat-0.7 Na-139 K-3.3 Cl-109* HCO3-24 AnGap-9 [**2128-4-19**] 08:14AM BLOOD ALT-81* AST-108* AlkPhos-109 TotBili-1.9* [**2128-4-19**] 08:14AM BLOOD Albumin-3.6 Calcium-8.4 Phos-3.7 Mg-1.8 Studies: [**2128-3-8**] bone scan - No evidence of osseous metastasis.
No evidence for recurrence or metastatic disease.
No discrete defect to suggest ischemia.
LFTs increased and a liver duplex was done showing relatively slowed acceleration times and low resistive indices, with waveforms suggestive of the possibility of hepatic arterial stenosis.
There was bidirectional flow within the left portal vein.
A CTA was then done noting marked focal kink and abrupt caliber change at the hepatic arterial anastomosis, narrowing at the portal venous anastomosis and an area of hypodensity in the liver transplant, which suggested a site of ischemia/hypoperfusion or perhaps early infarction, although the vast majority of the liver opacified normally.
He was then taken back to the OR on [**4-20**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] who performed excision of hepatic artery atheroma, with revision and reanastomosis for hepatic artery stenosis and liver biopsy.
He was started on prograf on [**4-20**] as well as cellcept and steroid taper.
There was a right pleural effusion.
Pain was hard to control requiring higher doses of dilaudid (6mg prn q 3 hours).
Duplex of the liver revealed patent main, left and right portal veins with normal hepatic veins and hepatic arteries.
There was no biliary dilatation or ascites.
On [**4-25**], an ERCP was done with a stricture at the anastomotic site between the donor and recipient common bile duct, with mild extravasation of contrast seen at that site.
Given the new pancreatic duct dilation on CT a sphincterotomy was performed over the stent in the 12 o'clock position using a needle-knife.
He continued to complain of abdominal pain and developed abdominal distension.
An abdominal CT on [**5-7**] showed improved small-bowel obstruction with transition point in the mid right abdomen compared to [**2128-5-2**], although there was distention of mid small bowel loops with respect to the distal small bowel.
There was decreased small amount of fluid with locules of air along the liver transplant bed.
Previously noted pancreatic ductal dilatation was improved.
Daily KUBs demonstrated decreased small bowel distension.
ABD CT was repeated on [**5-10**] showing Patent transplant vasculature with caliber change in the hepatic artery at the anastamosis due to size mismatch and partial small bowel obstruction.
Due to rising LFTs, a liver biopsy was performed on [**5-12**] with changes consistent with moderate acute cellular rejection with centrivenulitis,mild cholestasis.
There was no biliary necrosis or obstruction.
Although, he did experience a rising creatinine with creatinine increasing to 3.5 on [**5-19**] likely due to prograf.
On [**5-19**], he was taken to the OR for laparoscopy for persistent complaints of abdominal pain.
He underwent exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection with primary anastomosis.
A twist in the bowel and a stitch was which was tenting up the omentum was noted causing the twist in the bowel.
NG was removed and diet was gradually resumed, but he developed diarrhea and complaints of abdominal discomfort.
ABD CT was done on [**5-25**] showing new small bowel wall thickening possibly representing infectious or inflammatory process.
There as also new small amount of ascites.
Diarrhea resolved.
An ERCP was performed noting mismatch donor/recipient size otherwise there was no leak/stenosis and the stent was removed.
There were biliary centric features concerning for an infectious vs obstructive/ischemic process.
