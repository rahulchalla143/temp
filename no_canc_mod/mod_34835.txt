Admission Date:  [**2102-10-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-10-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2033-2-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: tramadol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**] Chief Complaint: 5.2cm descending thoracic aneurysm  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm repair with lumbar drain placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 82804**] is a 69-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia referred by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 82805**] for evaluation of a thoracic aortic aneurysm and has undergone serial CTs for surveillance the past two years.
She underwent evaluation at that time and was not felt to be appropriate for surgery due to small size of the aneurysm and she is not felt to be a candidate for endovascular repair.
She since then had some growth but with persistent chest/epigastric pain, which tends to be brought on by exertion.
She does not know of any family history of aneurysm and she has never smoked.
Given the persistence of her epigastric discomfort, size of her thoracic aortic aneurysm measured at 5.2cm and her relatively increased risk given her smaller stature and her gender, it was decided to go forward with elective endovascular repair.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Dyslipidemia Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm GERD Arthritis Pneumonia [**2094**] PSH: Hysterectomy, cataracts  Social History: Denies tobacco/alcohol use or illicit drug use.

Status post thoracic EVAR with a partially visualized stent that appears appropriately positioned.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
No acute findings in the abdomen to explain the patient's symptoms.
Probable slight narrowing at the celiac artery origin, which is due to atherosclerotic disease.
[**2102-10-24**]: Bilateral LENIs: No right or left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
There is again seen consolidation at the lung bases concerning for aspiration or multifocal pneumonia.
There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema.
There is an aortic stent identified which is intact.
Since [**2102-10-24**], the right lower lung opacity which was likely a combination of effusion and atelectasis has significantly resolved.
Mild amount of pleural effusion, however, still persists.
Right lower lung and middle lobe atelectasis is present.
Increased retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung atelectasis and mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion are similar in appearance.
IMPRESSION: Since [**2102-10-24**], right lower lung opacity which was likely a combination of atelectasis and moderate amount of effusion has significantly improved with mild residual fluid and minimal right basal and middle lobe atelectasis.
Left lower lung atelectasis and mild-to-moderate pleural effusion is unchanged.
INDICATION: 69-year-old female with abdominal pain.
No focal hepatic lesions are seen.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no splenomegaly.
Limited images of the right kidney demonstrate three simple cysts within the right kidney, the largest of which is seen in the lower pole measuring 2.3 x 2.0 cm in size.
There is a probable right renal parapelvic cyst.
A small left pleural effusion is seen.
Small left pleural effusion.
The lumbar drain was removed later that day for bleeding around the drain.
On POD 1, she complained of abdominal pain.
CT showed a properly positioned thoracic aortic stent, and no acute abdominal findings to explain patient's symptoms.
Her pain was controlled on dilauded.
She was transfused 1unit PRBCs for postoperative anemia with hematocrit of 27.
Chest Xray was concerning for a left lower lobe pneumonia.
On POD 4, She continued to complain of epigastric pain.
CXR was repeated which showed large right lower lobe pleural effusion and unchanged pneumonia in left lower lobe.
Bilateral Lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT.
She continued to complain of epigastric/abdominal pain, so abdominal ultrasound was peformed which showed a simple renal cyst.
Physical therapy recommended rehab, however, patient did not have insurance benefits for rehab or [**Last Name (LF) 269**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she will be discharged to home with her son with a rolling walker.
Throughout her admission, she continued to complain of epigastric pain, which was believed to be consistant with her chronic reflux after an extensive workup.
She was afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating small frequent meals, voiding adequate amounts, ambulating with a walker, with pain well controlled.
