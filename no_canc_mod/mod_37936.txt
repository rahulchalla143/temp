Admission Date:  [**2104-3-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2104-3-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2038-5-5**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of persistent nausea, vomiting, and failure to thrive times one week.
The patient has a significant history of biventricular failure and coronary artery disease, who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2104-2-15**] for a congestive heart failure exacerbation.
At the time of admission, the patient denies any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, bright red blood per rectum, melena, and diarrhea.
He does describe nausea and vomiting as well as some anorexia for the past week prior to admission.
In general, the patient has had decreased oral intake and overall failure to thrive for the last month.
The patient complains of increasing fatigue as well as a 14-pound weight gain since his discharge on [**2-15**] despite recently increasing his Lasix dose from 80 mg to 100 mg in the morning with an additional 80-mg dose in the afternoon, as well as the addition of Zaroxolyn administered prior to Lasix.
Therefore, the patient was admitted for further management of what was felt to be congestive heart failure exacerbation.
He did well until the middle [**2092**] when he began having persistently increasing numbers of congestive heart failure exacerbation.
He developed congestive heart failure intermittently and was hospitalized in [**2103-1-22**] and then again in [**2103-4-22**].
At this time, he started having increasing paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, dyspnea on exertion, and peripheral edema.
He was subsequently admitted in [**2104-1-22**] with a congestive heart failure exacerbation and return now with a 14-pound weight gain, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting.
Biventricular heart failure/congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%; thought secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Severe pulmonic stenosis.
Status post pacemaker implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement in [**2098**] secondary to third-degree heart block.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2086**] with cardiogenic shock at the age of 47; status post cardiac catheterization in [**2102-5-22**] with 50% proximal left anterior descending artery, severe pulmonary hypertension, wedge of 14, and global hypokinesis.
History of syncopal episodes.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus since [**2086**] with secondary neuropathy and cataracts.
Obstructive sleep apnea, on home BiPAP times one year.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a distant history of pipe smoking.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's brother died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 47.
In general, a rather ill-appearing male, sleeping, lethargic, easily arousable, in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed mucous membranes were moist.
Holosystolic murmur, positive jugular venous distention.
Pulmonary revealed mild bibasilar crackles; otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The abdomen was distended, positive bowel sounds, nontender, 2+ pitting edema of the abdominal wall.
Extremities revealed 2+ pitting edema to the scapulas bilaterally as well as to the bilateral knees.
No focal deficits.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed a right pleural effusion; unchanged, with right-sided atelectasis, dual chamber pacemaker placed, questionable left lower extremity opacity, possibly consistent with pneumonia.
No increased pulmonary vascular congestion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe biventricular failure who was admitted with worsening renal failure and worsening total body fluid overload thought secondary to his worsening congestive heart failure.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was continued on his current doses of aspirin, Pravachol, and Isordil given his history of coronary artery disease.
Given that the patient was felt to be significantly fluid overloaded with poor cardiac output, it was recommended that a Swan-Ganz catheter be placed and the patient to be placed on a Milrinone drip.
The patient was continued on Lasix which was changed to 40 mg intravenously b.i.d., and his digoxin was held given elevated digoxin levels, and captopril was held given his acute renal failure.
The initial Swan-Ganz placement was performed without difficulty and demonstrated hemodynamics as follows:  Right atrium 30 mmHg, right ventricle 80/30 mmHg, pulmonary artery of 80/30 mmHg, wedge of 30 mmHg.
The patient continued to demonstrate elevated filling pressures and a high wedge; however, some benefit of Milrinone drip was seen by following mixed venous saturations.
As the patient's blood pressure fell slightly with Milrinone, a vasopressin was added with subsequent stabilization of his blood pressure.
Given the patient's overall fluid overload which was not appropriately responding to Lasix therapy, a Renal consultation was obtained to consider continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
The medications were discontinued secondary to his lack of urinary output.
RENAL:  The patient had a baseline chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.1 which was increased to 2.9 at the time of admission.
In addition, the patient was maintained on Phos-Lo and Amphojel given his elevated phosphorous levels, and his electrolytes were followed carefully on a b.i.d.
PULMONARY:  The patient was felt to have a questionable left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray at the time of admission.
However, the patient had no signs or symptoms suggestive of a pneumonia on a clinical basis, and therefore antibiotics were withheld unless the patient had an increase in a white blood cell count of fever.
The patient has a history of sleep apnea and was continued on BiPAP at night.
The patient had no further pulmonary issues over the remainder of his hospitalization.
