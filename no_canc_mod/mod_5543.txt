During the periods when she was mildly confused or lethargic, the pain medications were used with care.
Patient was alert and oriented until the HD 11 when she was found to be confused and obtunded in respiratory distress and subsequently transferred to the ICU.
She experienced hoplessness and helplessness with her current situation.
She was rulled out for myocardial ischemia.
No intervention was recommended.
There was no acute ischemia.
Patient had an echocardiogram which showed right ventricular strain.
Patient had an angiogram done which showed stenosis in the left femoral to popliteal bypass graft, which was angioplastied.
Her signals dopelarable monophasic - posterior tibialis and dorsalis pedis bilaterally.
Pulmonary: Patient has an underlying COPD.
Her oxygen requirement increased over the course of the week of hodpitalization from one liter to three liters on nasal canula.
As her renal function worsened she developed bilateral pleural effusion, worse on the right.
However, she was also hemodilaysed on three consecutive days following the respiratory distress which was most likely attributable to right heart failure and fluid overload.
No supplemental nutrition was provided.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
She was unable to umbulate secondary to her painful feet.
At the time of transfer, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, yet had poor intake.
This stabilized shortly after ICU admission, with no further signs of bleeding per rectum.
However, she developed a supraventricular arrhythma with HR 130-140, similar to episodes of junctional tachycardia documented during prior admissions.
EKG while tachycardic also demonstrated ischemic ST elevations in the inferior leads with reciprocal depressions in the precordium.
Goals of care were clarified with the patient and her family, and the decision was made not to pursue aggressive cardiac interventions including cathetherization, CPR, shocks, or intubation.
Shortly thereafter, the patient's blood pressure became unstable, requiring >8L of fluid as well as neosynephrine.
