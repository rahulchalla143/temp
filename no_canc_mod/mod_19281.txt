Pregnancy was notable for intrauterine growth restriction in twin #2 and a 2-vessel cord in twin #2.
Coarse breath sounds with fair aeration.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.
Extremities: Left foot is noted to have shortened digits #1 through 4 with a normal fifth toe.
The baby was admitted with the diagnoses of symmetric intrauterine growth restriction,, prematurity, 2 vessel umbilical cord and amniotic band syndrome of the left foot.
Mild to moderate work of breathing and tachypea were evident after birth, and gradually improved over first several days of life.
Infant subsequently developed notable upper airway congestion, requiring periodic suctioning of the nares.
The congestion has persisted to the time of discharge, although it has not appeared to affect work of breathing or feeding ability, and may have improved somewhat after treatment for reflux was initiated (see below).
The infant was treated with caffeine for apnea of prematurity from day of life 3 to day of life 19.
The infant was prepared for discharge on [**12-5**], when in the context of having received 2 month immunizations and having a low-grade fever, infant had several desaturation and bradycardic spells while at rest.
By the time of discharge, infant has been stable without any desaturations or spells for over 5 days.
ECHOs performed over first 2 weeks of life secondary to murmur revealed a PDA that subsequently closed without treatment and a secundum ASD.
Of note, ECHO on [**10-9**] revealed a 1 mm x 3 mm mass on the superior surface of the left atrium, consistent with a thrombus.
This had not been seen on earlier ECHO on [**10-3**], and was thought to be most consistent with a line-related thrombus; at the time, the patient did have  UVC in place which initially had crossed into the left atrium.
An abdominal ultrasound on [**10-9**] revealed a small clot in the portal vein but no thrombus in the IVC or aorta.
Last ECHO on [**11-28**] revealed [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] to be unchaged in size or appearance, and repeat abdominal ultrasound on [**12-1**] showed portal vein thrombus had resolved.
Of note, ECHO on [**11-28**] did also show a small PDA with high-velocity L to R flow; the PDA had been closed on several earlier ECHOs.
Over the last several weeks of hospitalization, mild elevations in blood pressures were noted, to approximately 90/40s with MAPs 50-60s consistently.
These were considered high-normal to mildly elevated, but not needing treatment.
An extensive renal evaluation (see below) was negative without concerns for renal dysfunction.
During the hospitalization, clinical concerns for reflux became evident, and infant was begun on zantac 2 mg/kg q8 hrs with improvement.
Due to the elevated blood pressures noted over the last several weeks of hospitalization, renal evaluation was undertaken including urinalysis, BUN/Cr measurement, and repeat renal ultrasound.
By the time of discharge, blood pressures were stable at approximately 90/40-50; infant never required treatment for hypertension.
ORTHOPEDICS: Orthopedics was consulted due to the amniotic band syndrome of the left foot.
due to low gestational age.
First HUS on [**10-9**] revealed mildly dilated ventricles, with follow-up HUS on [**10-11**] being normal.
Subsequently ultrasounds on [**10-24**] and [**10-31**] were notable for an echogenic area anterior to the left caudothalamic groove.
This was read as a possible focal hemorrhage or infarction.
Neurology was consulted, and after reviewing the images, believed the findings were consistent with a left germinal matrix hemorrhage, not clinically significant.
No particular follow-up other than routine monitoring of development was recommended.
The infant did undergo eye examinations, with immature retinas in zone III seen on [**10-16**], and mature retinas without ROP seen on [**10-30**].
Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from     [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the     following 3 criteria: 1) Born at less at 32 weeks, 2)     born at between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of the following:     Day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household,     neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age     siblings, or 3) with chronic lung disease.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the     child's life immunization against influenza is     recommended for household contacts and out of home     caregivers.
Amniotic band syndrome left foot, toes 1 though 4.
Left atrial thrombus secondary to a high UVC.
Elevated blood pressures.
Apnea of prematurity requiring caffeine.
Left germinal matrix hemorrhage.
