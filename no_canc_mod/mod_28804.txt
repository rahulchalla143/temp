Family History: DM-mother, stroke-mother, [**Name (NI) 64167**]  Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS:  HR 69  BP 108/81  RR 14  O2 100% on AC 550 x 18, PEEP 5, FiO2 50% GEN: NAD, intubated, sedated HEENT: Pupils small, PERRL, + corneals, withdraws to pain CHEST: CTAB CV: RRR, no m/r/g ABD: soft, NT, ND, no masses or organomegaly EXT: wwp, no c/c/e NEURO: cooled, intubated, sedated, PERRL, + corneals, withdraws to pain DERM: no rashes   Pertinent Results: Blood culture x 2 [**2129-5-21**]: pending C diff + on [**2129-5-4**] Blood culture [**5-3**]: 1/2 bottles S epi Catheter Tip IV (PICC Line)- negative Blood culture [**2129-5-2**]:  VRE 1/2 bottles.
STUDIES: CT head [**2129-5-21**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage  CT abd / pelvis w/ contrast, CTA chest [**2129-5-21**]: Striated appearance of both kidneys with stranding, concerning for renal infarcts given provided history.
No PE or dissection.
Severe emphysema in the lungs.
No evidence of pneumothorax or change from prior study.
EKG: sinus tach rate 110, LAD LAFB, normal intervals, incomplete RBBB, LAE, no new Q waves, early R wave progression, no ST T wave changes.
No significant changes from prior [**3-10**].
Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY [**5-26**] back to MICU ============ 73 yoM w/ a h/o PVD, DM, CAD and recent C diff presenting with PEA arrest following 4 days of general malaise.
PEA arrest: Likely secondary to dehydration secondary to severe clostridium difficile infection.
No major electrolyte abnormalities.
He improved and it was felt that this was likely hypovolumeia that led to PEA arrest.
He continued on po vancomycin and IV flagyl for C. difficle infection.
# NSTEMI: On [**5-25**] patient was noted to have an unresponsive episode with normal hemodynamics at that time.
This was thought to possibly be due to a seizure versue vaso-vagal syncope.
During this episode, and EKG was obtained that revealed new T-wave inversions in his lateral leads.
Cardiac enzymes revealed an elevated troponin I to 0.46.
Given his co-morbid conditions, he was medically managed with beta blockade, aspirin PR and high dose statin (though this was only partially administered as patient developed swallowing difficulties).
He was also transfused given his Hematocrit < 30 and evidence of end organ ischemia.
The following day, he was transferred to the MICU in the setting of new onset hypotension to SBP 80s.
An Echo was obtained [**5-26**] that revealed decreased EF = 10% and biventricular dysfunction consistent with cardiogenic shock.
# Respiratory failure: Secondary to PEA arrest.
# Oliguria / Renal failure: Patient was admitted with hypotension after PEA arrest.
Also with chronic renal insufficience with baseline Cr of 1.7.
After transfer from the MICU [**5-24**], patient was noted to have minimal urine output, approximately 10cc/hr.
This was attributed to dehydration (given diarrhea and NPO with swallowing difficultie) and possible ATN given low pressure upon admission.
Patient became anuric on the morning of transfer to ICU and continued to be anuric throughout his stay.
# Unresponsive Episodes: On [**5-25**] patient suddenly became unresponsive though hemodynamically stable on telemetry.
He was then confused and with poor swallowing ability.
CT head was obtained and did not reveal an acute intracranial process.
EEG was obtained [**5-26**] showing global encephalopathy without evidence of epileptiform complexes, Neurology felt neurologic dysfunction could be from recrudecenc of old infarct deficits.
# Bilateral renal infarcts: Seen on imaging.
Intial Echo [**5-23**] did not show vegetations that could account for renal infarcts.
# CAD: Has a history of MI in [**2120**] s/p stent.
Patient intially with negative cardiac enzymes, but then with NSTEMI as above on [**2129-5-25**].
# Anemia: Acute hematocrit drop with OG lavage without gross blood but gastroocult +.
He was then transferred to the ICU for hypotension [**5-26**].
# DM: HISS, last A1C was 6% in [**7-9**]  # COPD: Standing atrovent and placed on prn albuterol to avoid tachycardia  # Foot wound: Consulted podiatry who recommended dry dressings to wound.
Antibiotics were not intially continued for this given his wound did not appear infected and he had treated his treatment course for osteomylitis.
# Recent GI hemorrhage: Patient with recent admission for massive GI hemorrhage of unclear source (EGD x 2 with ulcerations, no source on colonoscopy, tagged RBC negative) requiring 10u PRBC.
Continued on PPI without evidence of further GI bleeding.
#On morning of [**5-28**] patient became acutely tachycardic, tachypnic and hypotensive.
Physican was called to bedside and found patient without radial pulse and only weakly palpable femoral pulse.
