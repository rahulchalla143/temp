Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary; reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to first diagonal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the ramus intermedius coronary artery.
He describes the onset of this back pain as occurring after mowing the lawn for 15 minutes and often resolving with continued exercise.
A stress echocardiogram on [**2134-1-13**] revealed ischemic changes in the absence of anginal type symptoms at a moderate cardiac demand and fair functional capacity.
He was found to have coronary artery disease with left main disease upon cardiac catheterization and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

A stress echocardiogram on [**2134-1-13**] revealed ischemic changes in the absence of anginal type symptoms at a moderate cardiac demand and fair functional capacity.
He was found to have coronary artery disease with left main disease upon cardiac catheterization and was referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.
He had multiple PVC's, some couplets but was hemodyamically stable with this rhythm post operatively.
Chest tubes were discontinued without complication.
On POD 2 he was hypotensive with SBP 80's and complained of dizziness and lightheadedness.
He was orthostatic and received several boluses of albumin, as well as 2 units RBC for intravascular depletion.
He had an echocardiaogram on [**2134-1-19**] which showed EF 50% and right ventricular cavity dilated with depressed free wall function.
He remained orthostatic and complained of lightheadedness and was given additional albumin.
By the time of discharge on POD **** the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
