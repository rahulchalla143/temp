Per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, the patient was not in distress or tachypnic.
The patient was not tachypnic or in distress.
Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Lungs with diffuse crackles bilaterally all the way up lung fields, no tachpnea, no retractions, no accessory muscle use, able to speack easily Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
CXR ([**2125-4-7**]): Diffuse bilateral airspace and interstitial opacities with increased reticulation primarily in the upper lungs.
These findings may represent pulmonary edema superimposed on chronic lung disease.
CT Chest ([**2125-4-9**]): Extensive interstitial lung disease in both lungs.
Ground-glass opacities probably associated with pulmonary edema.
Mild cardiomegaly.
No evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are identified in the aorta.
Pulmonary artery measures 34 mm and suggests presence of pulmonary hypertension.
Right thyroid gland is enlarged, with a 10 mm hypodense nodule.
Enlarged lymph nodes in mediastinal and thoracic inlet stations.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Presence of degenerative changes in spine.
No worrisome bone lesions.
Limited images of upper abdominal organs is unremarkable.
Ground-glass opacities could represent areas of pulmonary edema.
Mild cardiomegaly.
Dilated thoracic aorta, with the ascending aorta measuring up to 44 mm and the descending aorta measuring 42 mm.
Findings suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The upper lobe predominant pattern is suggestive of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
No evidence of pulmonary edema at present study.
Stable enlargement of lymph nodes.
Stable dilated thoracic aorta with the ascending aorta measuring up to 45 mm and the descending aorta measuring up to 40 mm.
CXR ([**2125-4-15**]): No significant interval change in diffuse parenchymal abnormalities and cardiomediastinal contour was demonstrated.
No interval development of pleural effusion or pneumothorax has been seen.
Again note is made that the degree of the lung involvement by interstitial abnormalities is severe.

# Hypoxia: Patient was intermittently hospitalized in the MICU during her hospitalization for persistent hypoxia.
While patient does have significant ILD, presumed to be due to RA, it was not felt with rheumatologic and pulmonary consults that she was having acute decompensations of her lung disease, but that rather, it was serving as a poor baseline for transient hypoxic insults.
An echo documented diastolic heart failure and the patient was diuresed to being a total of 6 liters negative for length of stay.
Her ABGs largely reflected a metabolic alkalosis with PO2s in the 60s on high levels of oxygen (generally upwards of 6L NC, occasionally requiring shovel or NRB).
An in-depth conversation was held with the patient's son and HCP who expressed the desire to make his mother comfortable and move to a goal of no further hospitalizations.
# RA: As mentioned above, ILD was felt to be due to RA and rheumatology was consulted with recommendations to continue current therapy.
# Atrial flutter/Diastolic Heart Failure: Given documentation of diastolic heart failure, EP was consulted to decrease the patient's pacemaker rate and allow for better diastolic filling.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: Interstitial Lung Disease Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure   Discharge Condition: On oxygen, going to previous rehab facility with plans for CMO and palliative care.
Discharge Instructions: You were seen and evaluated for a low oxygen level, which was ultimately felt to be due to lung disease associated with your rheumatoid arthritis as well as extra fluid in your lungs from congestive heart failure.
