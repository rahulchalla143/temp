Admission Date:  [**2189-1-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2189-1-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2111-6-6**]     Sex:  M  Service:  C-Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 94633**] is a 77 year old male who has had multiple medical problems, including severe valvular ischemic heart failure, class III to IV, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, recurrent pneumoniae and a gastrointestinal bleed.
The patient was admitted for worsening shortness of breath times one week.
He initially had shortness of breath walking in his home, progressing to being short of breath at rest.
He reports difficulty lying flat.
The patient was admitted on [**2189-1-9**], initially to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] and initially treated for a pneumonia with Levaquin and Flagyl.
During the hospitalization, he had an episode of chest pain radiating to the left arm which was relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine sulfate.
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
He has been diuresed but has had decreased blood pressure and increased creatinine with continued rales and shortness of breath.
His telemetry suggests recurrent atrial fibrillation.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine between 2.2 and 2.5.
Ischemic and valvular heart disease.
Severe mitral regurgitation.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2184**] with a saphenous vein graft to posterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one and left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery; cardiac catheterization in [**2188-2-29**] had native three vessel disease with saphenous vein grafts occluded, left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery patent.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of gastrointestinal bleed secondary to peptic ulcer disease.
Urinary tract infection with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Neck supple, moist mucous membranes, extraocular movements intact, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, jugular venous distention approximately 11 cm up.
Abdomen: Soft, positive bowel sounds, no rebound tenderness, obese.
Extremities:  1+ lower extremity edema to the upper shin.
[**2189-1-8**] at 11:00 p.m., troponin was less than 0.3; [**2189-1-9**] one troponin less than 0.3, [**2189-1-10**] two troponins less than 0.3 and [**2189-1-11**], one troponin less than 0.3  Admission chest x-ray shows resolution of right upper lobe infiltrate consistent with [**2188-12-11**], right lower extremity opacity with increased confluence, small bilateral pleural effusions, left base atelectasis, indistinct pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild congestive heart failure; summary, pneumonia with superimposed congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram on admission was paced with a left bundle branch pattern; compared with old electrocardiogram, it was completely paced, however, by transfer to c-medicine, he was in atrial fibrillation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 77 year old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, recurrent pneumoniae, significant coronary artery disease, significant congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic and valvular disease, atrial fibrillation, and sick sinus syndrome status post permanent pacemaker, who presents with worsening shortness of breath and symptoms consistent with worsened congestive heart failure.
He was treated initially for pneumonia and transferred to c-medicine for management of congestive heart failure.
The patient was placed on spironolactone 12.5 mg daily, continued on an ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction for his mitral regurgitation at 20 mg daily.
On [**2189-1-15**], the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for tailored therapy secondary to poor diuresis on the floor despite Natrecor therapy.
He still had jugular venous distention to the angle of the mandible and still had crackles on lung exam and complained of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea four to five times on the night of [**2189-1-14**].
On [**2189-1-15**], the patient had a right internal jugular cordis placed.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was floated without difficulty.
On the evening of [**2189-1-16**], the patient complained of chest pain.
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
When the patient was discharged from the Unit, his nitroglycerin drip was changed to oral nitrates and he received intravenous Bumex as needed for diuresis.
The patient had decreased complaints of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
Then, on [**2189-1-22**], his weight had increased to 100.1 kilograms and he had a slight increase in chest fullness and some shortness of breath.
Valvular disease:  The patient had an echocardiogram on [**2188-12-15**] prior to this admission, with left atrium moderately dilated, no thrombus, left ventricular function mildly depressed, +1 tricuspid regurgitation, +1 aortic regurgitation, +4 mitral regurgitation and a simple atheroma in the descending artery.
The patient was evaluated by the surgical service for a mitral valve repair, especially in the context of his severe congestive heart failure.
It was felt that a large component of his congestive heart failure was secondary to the mitral valve disease and, if it could be corrected, the patient would benefit greatly .
In workup for the mitral valve replacement, the patient had an ultrasound of the carotids on [**2189-1-20**]; impression was minimal left internal carotid artery plaque, no associated stenosis, study otherwise normal.
The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2189-1-22**]; left atrium was moderately dilated, right atrium mildly dilated, there was a catheter or pacing wire seen in the right atrium and/or right ventricle, left ventricular wall thickness was normal, left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated, overall left ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed, no resting left ventricular outflow obstruction, right ventricular free wall hypertrophied, right ventricle mildly dilated, focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle, focal calcifications of the ascending aorta, 1 to 2+ aortic regurgitation, left ventricular ejection fraction 30%, tricuspid gradient 50 mm of mercury, severe +4 mitral regurgitation, mild mitral annular calcification, mild thickening of mitral valve chordae, tips of papillary muscles were calcified, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension, no definitive vegetations seen but this is best concluded by a transesophageal echocardiogram.
The initial plan was to have tailored therapy for congestive heart failure in the Unit and preoperatively evaluate the patient for possible mitral valve surgery but, due to complications during the patient's course that will be discussed in the infectious disease section, the surgery was deferred.
The transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2189-1-16**] read left atrium mildly dilated, no contrast or thrombus seen in the body of left atrium, left atrial appendage or body of the right atrium, right atrial appendage; right atrium mildly dilated, intra-atrial septum normal, no atrial septal defect seen by 2D or color Doppler; left ventricular wall thickness and cavity normal; there was a simple atheroma in the aortic arch; descending aorta normal diameter, simple atheroma in descending thoracic aorta, 4+ mitral regurgitation, mitral regurgitation jet was eccentric; mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity with fused commissures and tethering of leaflet motion; no change in this study from [**2188-12-15**].
The patient had three episodes of chest pain, one on the [**Hospital Ward Name 8559**], one while in the Unit and a final one on the floor.
During all three, he ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
Likely some episode of congestive heart failure and anxiety contributed to the chest pain.
The pain was relieved with 2 mg of morphine and 1 mg of Ativan, and the patient was resting comfortably in bed.
Coronary artery disease treatment:  The patient was treated with aspirin 162 mg daily, lisinopril as stated above, Lipitor 10 mg daily, and Toprol XL 12.5 mg daily.
He has a history of prerenal azotemia secondary to vigorous diuresis.
Overnight, from [**1-18**], the patient complained of right neck pain at the right internal jugular site; he said it was terribly painful.
The patient had two sets of positive blood cultures on [**2189-1-20**] for Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and an negative urine culture.
In the past, he has had a history of MRSA urinary tract infection.
The first bottle became positive on [**2189-1-21**] and the patient was dosed with vancomycin promptly.
The patient had a transesophageal echocardiogram repeated on [**2189-1-27**]; no mass or thrombus seen in left atrium or left atrial appendage, no mass or thrombus seen in right atrium or right atrial appendage, no atrial septal defect, no mass or vegetation seen on aortic valve; mitral valve thickened but no mass or vegetation seen in mitral valve and there was no change in terms of the severity of the regurgitation.
