In addition to the history noted in her admission chart, further interview was revealing for her being in her usual state of health until about 4 weeks ago, when she began feeling lethargic, which worsened over the ensuing 3 weeks; she attributed this to working extra hours.
During that time she noted intermittent rhinorrhea, but no constitutional symptoms or cough.
She had no sick contacts, but traveled the weekend prior to admission to NH.
Regarding her presenting complaint, right hip pain, she did not have any problems with her left knee, noting it to be at its baseline with respect to irritability and edema with activity; corroborating this history is her benign tap results of the left knee.
# Multi-focal infiltrates, bilaterally: Working diagnosis was peri-septic lung injury due to monoarticular large joint infection of unclear etiology; the differential included several possibilities, but the most likely was CA-atypical-PNA, although it seemed unlikely that she would coincidentally present with a PNA unrelated to her chief complaint; other unlikes possibilities were thought to be aspiration vs. multi-focal alveolar hemorrhaging (no hemoptysis) vs. acute chest (no CP, smear reassuring) vs. Alveolar protenosis (CT-changes not bilateral or medial, absence of chronic frothy cough).
Admitted to the medical floor (SIRS3) on the evening of [**9-17**]  SIRS Course:  # Hip and knee pain: Right Hip fluid was tapped and showed birefringent crystals consistent with gout flare.
Hip joint had no sign of fracture on x-ray.
Knee swelling was increased in amount of discomfort and felt warm and tender with effusion on exam.
On admission to the floor patient's pain was essentially unchanged on predisone.
Patient improved markedly with decreasing pain in right hip and left knee.
Recommend re-evaluation by PCP and discontinuing/tapering of narcotics in 1 week if patients pain well controlled.
# Multifocal infiltrates: See [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course above for details.
Briefly, patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitering of acute onset hypoxia while on the floor.
On admission to the floor Ms [**Known lastname 1968**] had no dyspnea or hypoxia and was weaned off of oxygen but did endorse a dry cough that was nonproductive of sputum for collection.
Pulmonolgy saw patient -- differential diagnosis for 'crazy paving pattern' noted on CT scan is as follows (per pulmonary consult note): "There is a differential to 'crazy paving' which is listed above.
I agree that lipoid pneumonia is less likely based on history.
Other possibilities include diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, alveolar proteinosis, drug reaction, atypical presentation of adenocarcinoma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, viral or atypical infection, and less likely non-specific interstitial pneumonitis.
TRALI would be expected to present with pulmonary symptoms or new oxygen requirements, none of which occurred."
# Anemia: Pt has known SC trait with possible "crisis" during pregnancy.
On labs had macrocytic anemia with target cells, acanthocytes and basophilic stippling on RBC smear.
Heme was following, and did not think that pulmonary symptoms were due to acute chest.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
