Admission Date:  [**2194-10-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2194-10-27**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year old male with no previous history of coronary artery disease except a rule out myocardial infarction in [**2188**] and reportedly negative coronary arteries in a [**2184**] cardiac catheterization that was done prior to hernia repair, presenting with one day of sudden onset substernal chest pain on the afternoon of admission while working outdoors.
The chest pain was five out of ten, constant, nonradiating and not associated with nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.
There was no associated shortness of breath.
The pain persisted at rest and the patient presented to an outside hospital.
An electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute with ST elevations in II, III and AVF and depressions in V1 and V2.
The patient also had right sided electrocardiogram leads showing ST elevations in R3 and R4.
The patient was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for cardiac catheterization.
Electrocardiogram at that time showed normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats per minute with ST elevations in II, III and AVF and depressions as stated before, in V1 and V2.
The patient's catheterization revealed a right dominant circulation with a 50% left anterior descending artery lesion, an 80% left circumflex lesion at obtuse marginal one and a right coronary artery lesion that was proximal 100%.
He had stent to the right coronary artery lesion with resolution of chest pain and ST segments following revascularization.
Cardiac index was 3.24.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient had no dyspnea on exertion, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and no palpitations.
Hernia repair times three.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is remarkable for coronary artery disease in the patient's brothers.
Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.
Extremities:  Right groin with 1 inch x 1 inch hematoma, Dopplerable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses on right and left.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 83 year old gentleman presenting with an inferior myocardial infarction and is status post stent to the proximal right coronary artery.
The patient was hemodynamically stable and pain free upon presentation to the Coronary Care Unit.
The patient was pain free throughout his hospital stay and had complete resolution of his ST elevations on electrocardiogram.
He had an echocardiogram prior to discharge, with preliminary read showing a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 45%.
The patient also had several runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in the first 24 to 48 hours post infarction.
