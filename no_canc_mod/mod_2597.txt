HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old Haitian woman, who speaks little English with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, hemolytic anemia and neutropenia initially of unknown etiology, is now recognized as myelodysplastic syndrome and cervical spondylosis, who presents with a subarachnoid, subdural, and epidural hemorrhages as well as seizure.
She had come in with a new onset grand mal tonic-clonic seizure and was also found to have a high fever to 103 in the setting of neutropenia.
At that time, she was diagnosed as well with hemorrhagic cystitis.
On the morning of admission, the patient's daughters say she was doing well except for a slight headache.
She stated to them that she had hit her head on a bed rail while trying to get out of bed, and she thought that the cause of her headache.
There was no other trauma.
She was also saying to the daughter that she had some heaviness in the right arm, and in the afternoon the daughters came in the nursing home and found her to be not talkative.
She was brought to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], where she was noted to have jerking of her right arm and right leg only and a subsequent episode in which all extremities were jerking.
A head CT revealed a right frontoparietal subarachnoid hemorrhage, a right occipital EDH, left parietal EDH, and SDH (subdural hemorrhage), substitute epidural hemorrhage for EDH.
She also had a fever to 101.6 and was having profuse melena in the ED.
No nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea until the day of admission.
Hematology was called per the Neurosurgery team and reportedly stated that extensive workup of her hemolytic anemia and neutropenia had yielded no answers at that time, however, patient was subsequently diagnosed with MDS.
On her prior admission, Neurology had been consulted for new onset seizures and her workup including MRI and LP had been negative.
Cervical spondylosis.
Hemolytic anemia and neutropenia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No smoking or alcohol.
No seizure or stroke.
No scleral icterus or injection.
Neck was supple, no carotid bruits.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Neurologic:  Mental status is not responding to voice or sternal rub.
Sustained clonus in the lower extremities bilaterally.
Head CT showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontoparietal region, left vertex.
Epidural hemorrhage in the right occipital region.
Epidural and subdural hemorrhages in the left parietal area, no shift.
Patient had several melanotic stools.
Regarding the patient's fever, she had a low-grade temperature in the setting of a low white count.
No signs of increased bleed on the repeat CT.
According to Neurology, the cause of the intracranial hematomas and subarachnoid blood is most likely a consequence of dysfunctional platelets while head trauma particularly the true contrecoup distribution as possible, it seems somewhat unlikely in the absence of a clear history of head trauma and the lack of superficial stigmata on examination or imaging study.
She remained with left upper extremity paralysis, minimal movement of her left lower extremity, and a left facial droop, however, her mental status was fairly clear, although she did have some waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].
She was maintained on Dilantin and had no further seizure activity.
She was given vitamin K to correct her mild coagulopathy.
She had a MRI/MRA on [**2167-5-6**], which was somewhat limited due to the patient's movement, but demonstrated minimal resolution of the right posterior epidural hemorrhage and stable subdural and epidural hemorrhages and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The MRA was degraded by motion artifact, however, there was no significant intracranial stenoses or vascular malformation seen.
Melena:  Patient continued to have brown heme-positive stools secondary to gastritis.
The patient had fever in the setting of neutropenia.
She continued to have fevers for the next several days and vancomycin was started given her central line.
She continued to have low-grade fevers, but no further spikes and then developed diarrhea, and stool was positive for Clostridium difficile toxin.
On [**2167-5-12**], she was noted to have left arm warmth and swelling at the site of a previous IV.
The patient was started on Keflex and a concern for cellulitis in this diabetic patient with compromised immune status.
She continued to have hyponatremia, which resolved with IV fluids, normal saline.
Physical Therapy was deemed not safe enough to go home without 24-hour care secondary to poor mental status and would require rehab upon discharge.
still with left upper extremity paralysis and minimal movement of the left lower extremity.
