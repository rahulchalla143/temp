[**2138-11-3**] - Cardiac Catheterization, coronary angiography   History of Present Illness: 66 year old man with progressive chest pain with exertion over the past 6 months.
A cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed severe three vessel disease.

Family History: Family history positive for CAD: father had MI and died at age 75.
Mother died of an MI at age 65.
The LMCA was short and without significant disease.
The LAD had 2 serial 70% stenoses proximal and mid-segment with a 90% ostial D1 stenosis as well.
The LCX had a 99% stenosis at the previous POBA site.
The RCA had a 90% stenosis in the mid-segment.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated systemic arterial pressure with an SBP of 148 mm Hg.
There was no aortic stenosis will pullback across the aortic valve.
Patent right internal carotid artery stent with no evidence of stenosis.
60-69% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
[**2138-11-4**] ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior, inferolateral and lateral akinesis.
Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 31%.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Right lower extremity: Thrombosis of the right external iliac artery at its origin at the level of the bifurcation of the right common iliac artery.
Multifocal atherosclerotic disease is seen in the widely patent right common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal arteries.
Left lower extremity: Multifocal atherosclerotic disease is seen throughout the left iliac arterial system, left common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal arteries.
There is one vessel runoff to the left foot via the left posterior tibial artery.
[**2138-11-5**] Chest CTA Minimal centrilobular emphysema.
No lung nodule identified.
He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed a patent right and a  60-69% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
There was a question of a lung nodule on chest x-ray however a follow-up CT scan showed no evidence of any lung nodules.
On postoperative day one he complained of pain and his right leg pulses were absent and a vascular surgery consult was obtained.
A CTA of his aorta and lower extremities was performed which showed a thrombosed right external iliac artery from its origin at the bifurcation of the right common iliac artery.
