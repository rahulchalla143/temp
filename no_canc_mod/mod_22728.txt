Question of a subcapsular hepatic hematoma.
Review of the images demonstrated no caval anatomic variations, a single inferior vena cava, without intraluminal filling defects.
There was no residual bleeding or hematoma in the right groin.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate postprocedure complications.
liver hematoma REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please evaluate liver with non-contrast scan CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: recent IV study  INDICATION: History of bilateral pulmonary embolism with ?
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is right lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.
There is a large low density collection adjacent to the right lobe of the liver that appears to conform to the liver capsule and produces mass effect upon the right lobe.
Pneumobilia is noted.
There is stranding adjacent to this large collection extending along the right paracolic gutter.
There is a 10.6 cm exophytic cystic lesion at the upper pole of the left kidney that appears to have a high density rim and possible septation.
There is no intra-abdominal free air.
Note is made of a spiculated area of soft tissue attenuation in the left breast that appears to correspond to an area of a surgical defect anteriorly.
Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Large subcapsular collection producing mass effect upon the right lobe of the liver with Hounsfield unit attenuation values ranging from 15 to 22.
Considerations include a chronic subcapsular hematoma, or a subcapsular biloma in this patient that is status post cholecystectomy.
Spiculated soft tissue density in the left breast that appears to be near surgical defect.
11 mm exophytic lesion at the upper pole of the left kidney with the suggestion of a high density rim and a possible septation.
MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CONTRAST  [**2165-10-17**] 1:30 PM  MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CONTRAST  Reason: please perform MRV of HEPATIC VEINS to evaulate for clot/sou Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 65 year old woman 4 weeks s/p lap Chole with known PE & subcapsular hematoma.
Perform MRV of hepatic veins to evaluate for clot or source of pulmonary embolism.
FINDINGS: There is an large subcapsular hematoma along the lateral aspect of the liver, measuring approximately 17.3 cm AP x 10 cm TV x 23.4 cm SI, resulting in significant leftward shift of the hepatic parenchyma and compression upon the IVC.
There is no evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There appears to be a small right-sided pleural effusion.
Low signal within the inferior vena cava after administration of gadolinium at the infrarenal level likely represents an IVC filter.
Large lateral subcapsular hematoma along the lateral aspect of the liver.
No evidence of thrombus within the hepatic veins, which show appropriate directional flow.
Interventional radiology was consulted for the subcapsular hepatic hematoma noted on abdominal CT imaging; a percutaneous drainage catheter was placed.
Psychiatry was also consulted for possible depression; reportedly there has been a history of depression approximately one month prior to hospitalization.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day): hold for loose stools.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.

Inform the office that you will need to have an abdominal CT scan of your abdomen to assess the fluid collection and that this needs to be compared to previous CT of your abdomen.
