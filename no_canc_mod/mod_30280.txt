Beta blockade was initially withheld secondary to systolic BP in the 100's and bradycardia.
He remained in a normal sinus rhythm without evidence of atrial or ventricular dysrythmias.
He continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis and made steady progress with physical therapy.
His discharge chest x-ray showed only small bilateral pleural effusions.
