Admission Date:  [**2161-3-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-4-5**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 87 year old male with a history of COPD, recent pneumonia, and recent admission s/p fall with complex tibial plateau and non-displaced fibular head fractures.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital6 5016**] from [**2161-2-24**] to [**2161-3-4**] for COPD exacerbation and pneumonia.
Several days after discharge, he fell and sustained complex tibial plateau and non-displaced fibular head fractures.
He was admitted to [**Hospital 28941**] and then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] due to his comorbidities and concern about whether he would be a good surgical candidate.
After his Orthopedics appointment, he developed acute shortness of breath while waiting for his ride back to rehab, which he attributed to his oxygen tank running out.
Prior to his recent pneumonia admission, he had not been on home oxygen, nebulizers, or systemic steroids.
He had Troponin elevation to 0.10 (<0.01 on [**2161-3-12**]) and proBNP 1188.
His CXR was grossly unremarkable with no definite acute pulmonary process.
He became hypotensive to 79/58 and was given 3 L NS, with improvement in his pressure to 105/71 and UO 400 ml.
Subsequent CTA showed bilateral lobar and segmental pulmonary emboli, right lower lobe consolidation, and enlarged right heart likely due to right heart strain.
On reaching the ICU, the patient reported mild SOB improved from earlier in the day and a chronic cough, also improved.
He reported having looser stools than usual at rehab, but had been started on stool softeners, and mild periumbilical tenderness in his abdomen.
He denied any pain in his leg at the fracture site or in his calves.

# Alcohol: None # Drugs: None  Family History: No family history of abnormal bleeding or blood clots.
Sclera anicteric.
Left pupil slightly irregular in contour.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
CV: Mild tachycardia with regular rhythm.
Coarse breath sounds and rhonchi throughout.
Soft, mildly tender in epigastric area, ND.
No organomegaly or masses.
LE edema [**1-25**]+ with R>L.
Skin: Ecchymosis on right knee.
No rashes, ulcers, or other lesions noted.
Urine culture [**2161-3-28**]: No growth.
EKG Sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature beats and atrial premature beats.
Right bundle-branch block.
Comminuted tibial plateau fractures in unchanged alignment with approximately 11 mm of depression of the lateral tibial plateau articular surface.
CXR: Limited study, but otherwise grossly unremarkable with no definite acute pulmonary process.
Bilateral lobar and segmental pulmonary emboli.
Right lower lobe consolidation might represent infarct or less likely pneumonia/aspiration.
Enlarged right heart likely due to right heart strain.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
RV systolic function appears mildly depressed (RV not well seen).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR: New right pleural effusion and right lower lobe opacity, which may represent atelectasis, but aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 87 year old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and recent complex right knee fracture who developed SOB after an Ortho followup appointment and was found to have bilateral PEs on CTA with hypotension and evidence of right heart strain, hospital course was complicated by an aspiration pneumonia.
# Pulmonary Embolism: He presented with SOB and was found to have bilateral lobar and segmental pulmonary emboli on CTA, with evidence of right heart enlargement.
TTE showed mild right heart dysfunction.
# Aspiration pneumonia and encephalopathy.
The patient had an episode of desaturation to high 80's% on RA improved to 90's% with nasal cannula oxygen with some associated altered mental status on [**2161-3-31**].
He had a chest x-ray with new right sided effusion and increased RLL opacification consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
He described some difficulty swallowing though speech and swallow eval cleared him for a ground solid, thin liquid diet.
He may require repeat swallow eval if his symptoms persist .
# Frequent premature APB's and tachycardia.
On telemetry on the medical floor, the patient had asymptomatic tachycardia to 110-130 with frequent APB's and possible changing p wave morphology consistent with an atrial tachycardia.
Given his history of CAD and therefore known indication for beta-blocker, he was started on metoprolol for rate control, blood pressure control and to reduce atrial ectopy.
# COPD: He has a history of COPD and continued smoking.
His urine lytes and Cr trend suggest a mixed picture with possible intrinsic renal component.
He should be non-weight bearing on that side until he follows-up as scheduled with his orthopedist.
We controlled pt's pain with oxycodone 2.5mg Q4H PRN and acetaminophen 650mg Q6 PRN.
# [**Doctor Last Name **]: Probable [**Doctor Last Name **] of chronic disease, this appears stable.
# Stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer.
The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer which was present from prior to this hospitalization.
He had some pain in his left heel and had early signs of a pressure blister in that area.
7. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
10. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] at [**Location (un) 7658**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute pulmonary embolism Aspiration pneumonia Tachycardia, NOS with frequent APB's Hyponatremia Tibial plateau fracture [**Location (un) **] CAD GERD   Discharge Condition: Stable.
This was a complication of your recent leg fracture and associated immobilization.
Obtain dosage changes of the coumadin from a doctor based upon the blood test results.
In addition, you were noted to have frequent premature heart beats.
You had an aspiration pneumonia which you must treat with the antibiotic Vancomycin as prescribed for 8 more days.
You have a pressure sore on your sacrum.
Please wear multipodus boots when in bed to reduce pressure on your heels as you are showing some early signs of pressure damage to your left heel.
You must not bear weight on the right leg until you are seen again in the orthopedic clinics as scheduled.
