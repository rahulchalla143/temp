He did have oculocephalic and corneal reflexes.
He again had little to no spontaneous movements of his extremities but there was noted to be some withdrawal on the right side to noxious stimulation as well as some minimal withdrawal on the left leg to noxious stimulation.
As a result of the appearance of the MRI which showed bilateral watershed infarcts, there was some suspicion for potential endocarditis causing multiple embolic events.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which showed no vegetations consistent with endocarditis.
Given the history of the positive blood cultures, this was felt necessary to rule this out and after the TEE was done this was felt not likely to be the diagnosis.
These infarcts are presumed to be from an episode of hypotension during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course in which his systolic blood pressures dipped down to 70.
He had no further events of A flutter.
The patient had cardiac enzymes done to rule out myocardial ischemia as being the cause for atrial flutter and these did not suggest any myocardial ischemia.
Initially this was done to try to prevent any fluid overload that would compromise his ability to come off the ventilator.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  As mentioned before, the patient had a transaminitis which was felt to be due to Dilantin.
The patient continues to have an anemia of unclear etiology.
In part, this is probably likely due to anemia of chronic disease; however, iron studies are still pending at this time.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was being treated for an aspiration pneumonia immediately that was pansensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
As mentioned, he had a coagulase-negative staphylococcal infection in his blood for which he was on vancomycin for a total of 14 days.
