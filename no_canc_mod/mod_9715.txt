In addition, podiatry felt that her right toe lesion was not infected.
Possible etiologies include poor PO intake and reduced insulin dosing [**3-18**] vomiting and headache caused by her high BP.
She was discharged with [**Month/Day (2) **] sugars between 88-139 with keto dip sticks and an emergency glucagon kit and [**Last Name (un) **] follow up.
Hypertensive Urgency: Etiology of acute increase in BP despite medication unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] likely acute worsening of chronically progressive diabetic macrovascular disease despite recent medication increase.
HA and N/V likely related to elevated BP (consistent with prior episodes), CT negative for acute intracranial process.
The risks and benefits of leaving the hospital including headache, nausea, worsening heart failure, worsening kidney function and intracranial hemorrhage were discussed with the patient; however, patient elected to leave on her home verapamil, hydralazine and lisinopril with discharge clinic f/u on Friday [**2150-8-7**].
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic HF: Patient's presentation is consistent with acute on chronic worsening of diastolic CHF (BNP elevated >8000) with hypertension leading to increased afterload, reduced filling and pulmonary and peripheral edema that also likely contributed to patient's renal injury.
Patient was initially volume overloaded and received lasix in the ED and ICU.
On transfer to the floor patient appeared euvolemic with clear lung exam and no peripheral edema so lasix was held in light of her worsening renal function.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Pt's Cr was 1.0 in [**1-/2150**] worsening to 1.8 in the past 6 months, elevated to 2.8 on admission.
Renal ultrasound [**3-/2150**] showed worsening parenchymal disease, UPEP was normal.
Most likely multifactorial namely acute pre-renal azotemia (admission BUN:Cr ~20:1) [**3-18**] hypertension, poor PO, and osmotic diuresis from DKA, coupled with sub-acute worsening of intrinsic renal disease [**3-18**] T1DM and HTN.
Urine output remained adequate, u/a positive for glucose, ketones and protein, negative for infection.
# Elevated troponin: Pt had troponin elevated to 0.07 on admission  most likely secondary to demand ischemia from increased afterload in hypertensive urgency and worsened by decreased renal clearance.
Pt was asx with negative EKGs; however, troponins were trended given her high risk as a diabetic and possibility of atypical chest pain with neuropathy.
Hypoxia: Mild hypoxemia in the ED in the context of patient anxiety as well as hypertension, increasing afterload on chronic diastolic HF (BNP >8000) leading to pulmonary vascular congestion (confirmed on CXR).
# Rt Toe Lesion: Toe showed no signs of drainage or pus, no erythema noted.
# Neuropathy: continued home gabapentin .
# Transitional Issues: - patient to follow-up in post discharge clinic for BP and glycemic control monitoring - will need electrolytes checked at post discharge clinic as well - volume status and renal function will need assessment at post discharge clinic as well, as her lasix was held on discharge, may need to be restarted - patient provided with number for podiatry for right toe lesion if any signs of worsening  Medications on Admission: FLUOXETINE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider: [**Name Initial (NameIs) 16471**]) - 40 mg Capsule - 2 Capsule(s) by mouth daily FUROSEMIDE -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 40 mg Tablet - 3 Tablet(s) by mouth qday GABAPENTIN -  (Dose adjustment - no new Rx) - 300 mg Capsule - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth twice a day HYDRALAZINE -  (Dose adjustment - no new Rx) - 10 mg Tablet - three Tablet(s) by mouth four times a day INSULIN GLARGINE [LANTUS] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider; Dose adjustment - no new Rx) - 100 unit/mL Cartridge - 20units/ day once a day INSULIN GLULISINE [APIDRA] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 100 unit/mL Cartridge - per sliding scale  as needed LEVOTHYROXINE - 100 mcg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth DAILY (Daily) LISINOPRIL -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) (On Hold from [**2150-4-29**] to unknown for elevated Cr) - 10 mg Tablet - Tablet(s) by mouth OMEPRAZOLE - 40 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

Hypertensive urgency 2.
Diabetic Ketoacidosis .
Acute on chronic kidney injury   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You came in with high [**Hospital1 **] sugars, and high [**Hospital1 **] pressure, which caused nausea, vomiting and some damage to your kidneys.
Your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] pressue slightly improved, but remained elevated on discharge.
You can continue to care for the wound yourself but please call them at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4335**] if you develop pain, redness, swelling or drainage from the toe.
Please seek medical attention for worsening nausea, vomiting, inability to take oral intake, high [**Telephone/Fax (2) **] sugars, or any other concerning symptoms.
