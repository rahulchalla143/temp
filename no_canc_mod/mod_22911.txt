This was also accompanied by fevers measured to be 103 degrees.
His ear pain resolved somewhat, but he has had ongoing dyspnea and productive cough with large amounts of yellow sputum since then.
He had one episode of blood-tinged sputum, in the setting of blowing his nose and coughing frequently.
He had a mild improvement in his symptoms and also took amoxicillin.
He presented to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] Emergency Dept with worsening dyspnea.
Exam was notable for pale skin, diminished lung sounds at left base, no wheezes or rhonchi.
CXR was notable for LLL PNA, but no cavitary lesions.
Upon arrival to the ICU, he felt his breathing was improved and he was not feeling dyspneic as long as his oxygen mask is on.
He endorsed a poor appetite, a 20 lb weight loss, and drenching sweats over the past two weeks.
He reported no nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
ROS: otherwise negative  Past Medical History: Childhood asthma 1 episode of pneumonia as an infant   Social History: Current smoker until onset of this illness.
Family History: No known lung disease.
Grandmother with CHF and adult-onset diabetes.

Decreased BS over right base.
No wheezes or rhonchi.
CV: RRR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: NABS, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly, no rebound tenderness or guarding.
EXT: no c/c/e SKIN: mild erythematous patches at site of prior telemetry leads.
- MULTIPLE ORGANISMS CONSISTENT WITH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   MULTIPLE ORGANISMS CONSISTENT WITH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2133-1-20**]):  - No respiratory viruses isolated.
Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2133-1-18**]):  - Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
[**2133-1-19**] portable CXR: No previous images.
The heart is normal in size and there is no vascular congestion.
There is increased opacification involving the left base with obliteration of the hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle.
This is consistent with atelectasis and effusion.
However, the possibility of pneumonia would have to be seriously considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
[**2133-1-21**] portable CXR: AP chest compared to large area of left lower lobe consolidation and a smaller region on the right have both improved minimally since [**1-19**].
Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 88348**] presented with respiratory distress after 2 weeks of URI and ear symptoms.
By symptoms and serology he likely had a Mycoplasma pneumonia in mid-[**Month (only) 1096**] and developed a bacterial super-infection resulting in a lobar pneumonia.
There was no clear organism for his worsening pneumonia but he improved with Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Ceftriaxone.
His hospital course was complicated by anemia, elevated INR, transaminitis, and persistent hypoxia after improvement of his pneumonia.
The anemia and transaminitis were thought to be from his Mycoplasma pneumonia.
The elevated INR was thought to be from critical illness and improved with supportive care and supplemental vitamin K. His persistent pneumonia required a few extra days of hospitalization and improved with encouraged ambulation, incentive spirometry, and chest physical therapy.
On examination he continued to have diminished breath sounds at his left base with no other abnormal lung findings.
He will need repeat LFTs, INR, and consideration for a repeat CXR to ensure resolution of his pneumonia.
Disp:*11 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Bacterial pneumonia  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
