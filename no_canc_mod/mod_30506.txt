Coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old man who was referred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] for cardiac catheterization secondary to a routine ETT which revealed 2.5 to 3 mm downsloping ST segment changes in V4 through V6.
There were also 1.5 to [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in the inferior leads.
Stress thallium imaging revealed a reversible defect in the basilar portion of the inferolateral wall.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  The patient is an elderly man in no acute distress.
Neck: Supple, midline, without masses or lymphadenopathy.
No bruit or JVD.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, without masses or organomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient came in for outpatient cardiac catheterization which revealed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and a right dominant coronary artery system with a severe three vessel disease.
The patient was admitted post catheterization because of left main lesion as well as oozing from the groin site.
In the middle of the day of postoperative day number three, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation and was rate controlled using 20 mg of IV Lopressor and 300 mg of IV Amiodarone.
The patient spontaneously converted back to normal sinus rhythm after approximately three to four hours of atrial fibrillation.
This helped with his previous orthostatic symptoms of dizziness as well as orthostatic hypotension.
At that time, the patient was tolerating a regular diet, and had adequate pain control on p.o.
pain medications and not having any anginal symptoms or orthostatic symptoms.
