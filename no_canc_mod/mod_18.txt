Admission Date:  [**2131-12-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-12-29**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim / Amiodarone / Quinine / Codeine / Zithromax / Lisinopril / Citalopram / Ciprofloxacin / Hydralazine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation PICC line placement Hemodialysis Transfusion of one unit packed red blood cells   History of Present Illness: A [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent admission [**Date range (1) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal failure with decision to initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital stay complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia presenting with altered mental status.
Per her daughter, the patient was home this past week and accidentally took trazodone 50 mg two days prior to admission, which had been discontinued due to confusion.
She complained of increased productive cough and oxygen requirement (previously intermittent 2L NC, now continuous) over the past two days, responding to an increase in nebulizer treatments.
Per report, patient had poor respiratory effort, became apneic, and was subsequently intubated.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and left lower lobe pneumonia.
Head CT negative for acute process.
The patient was started on levophed for hypotension peri-intubation, off within half an hour.
Past Medical History: - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: No pulmonary function testing in our system; currently managed with Duonebs - Wegener's granulomatosis: Complicated by renal failure requiring HD - End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis: Started on hemodialysis last admission, was previously on two years prior - Atrial fibrillation: Rate-controlled; on coumadin - Transient ischemic attack: Occurred during prior hospitalization when her anticoagulation was held - Hard of hearing: Bilateral hearing aids  Social History: The patient lives with her daughter.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Simple bilateral pleural effusions are moderate on the left and small on the right.
No definite underlying consolidation is seen.
Recommend three-month followup for right apex lesion with internal calcification, which may represent scarring, although underlying neoplastic process cannot be excluded.
Moderate-to-severe coronary artery atherosclerosis is most prominent in the left anterior descending artery.
Small pericardial effusion causes no mass effect.
Splenic hypodensity is not well characterized and ultrasound may be obtained for evaluation if clinically indicated.
Moderate emphysema.
[**2131-12-23**] CXR: Bibasal effusions with a pneumonic consolidation in the left lower lobe.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Left frontal encephalomalacia with probable slight further involution.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 46**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis with resulting chronic kidney disease, recent admission [**Date range (3) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal failure, started on hemodialysis w/hospital stay c/b left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia admitted with recurrant moraxella pneumonia and sepsis.
1)Moraxella pneumonia: Most likely explanation for respiratory failure/hypotension in ED requiring intubation.
She was successfully extubated on [**12-25**] and maintaining O2 sats on O2 via NC without e/o respiratory distress.
Concerning for endobronchial lesion with postobstructive pneumonia however chest CT did not show any underlying structural cause for recurrance of pneumonia.
She did have bilateral pleural effusions which appeared simple and did not appear to be parapneumonic.
In addition, daughter reports that she took trazodone two days prior to admission, which has caused confusion in the past.
She had a CT head on admission without acute process.
3)Coagulopathy: Her INR was 2 on admission, however climbed to peak of 5.3 likley due to poor nutrition and antibiotics.
4)Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis.
She was dialysed for volume overload in the hospital and was dishcarged with plan for dialysis at FMC - West Suburban Dialysis Center.
No signs or symptoms of active bleeding, guaiac negative.
6)Diarrhea - patient has developed diarrhea in setting of multiple admissions and antibiotics.
Diarrhea is most likely antibiotic associated due to alteration of normal bowel flora, however she will require two additional stool samples to rule out C.diff.
She will require monitoring of in's and out's and encouragement for oral intake to prevent dehydration.
7)Skin Breakdown: During her admission she began developing skin breakdown on her gluteal cleft likely due to a combination of immobility due to acute illness and diarrhea as discussed above.
8)Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  Her metoprolol was initially held in the ICU given sinus bradycardia and sepsis.
It was resumed at home dose on [**12-26**] however given borderline blood pressures, it was decreased to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**12-27**].
9) Spiculated lesion on CT chest: as discussed in radiology report, will need repeat CT in 3 months to reassess this lesion for stability.
Flonase 50 mcg/Actuation Spray, Suspension Sig: One (1) spray Nasal twice a day as needed for rhinorrhea.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: st. [**Doctor Last Name 2375**] manor  Discharge Diagnosis: Chronic Kidney disease on hemodialysis Wegener's granulomatosis Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation COPD Non-infectious diarrhea  Secondary Diagnoses: Anemia   Discharge Condition: fair O2 saturation 95% on 0.5L NC   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with confusion, low blood pressure and low oxygen most likely due to a serious pneumonia.
You were treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and your breathing improved.
You had blood cultures, urine cultures and stool cultures which did not show any evidence of infection.
You had dialysis with fluid removal as you were given a large amount of IV fluids on admission for your infection which caused swelling in your arms and fluid around your lungs.
You developed diarrhea during your admission which is most likely due to antibiotics.
You were started on loperamide to attempt to decrease the diarrhea and to prevent further skin breakdown.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have any concerning symptoms including fevers, confusion, chest pain, trouble breathing, low blood pressure or other worrisome symptoms.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1683**] or Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] after you have this study so they know to look for the results.
