Admission Date:  [**2146-7-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-7-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-6-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 76 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p CABG, s/p L CEA, CRI, CHF, and GERD who presents with dyspnea and cough.
He was initially seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**7-14**] with flu-like symptoms which his wife reports started 2 days prior.
He also felt a little bit more short of breath than usual.
He had a + sick contact a week prior who had cough and fevers.
He has continued to have low grade fevers to 99. .
He became more tachypneic, diaphoretic and was placed on bipap without much improvement.
EKGs with non-specific changes.
Cards was sons[**Name (NI) **] and felt was c/w NSTEMI in setting of infection/sepsis.
S/p MI [**2119**] 2) Carotid Stenosis - Left CEA, Right 100% Stenosed 3) Claudication in both calves 4) Neuropathy in lower extremities - etiology unknown 5) 2 Laminectomies [**2095**], [**2105**] 6) Spinal stenosis 7) Hyperlipidemia 8) Gout 9) CHF, last TTE [**11-22**] with LVH and EF 60% 10) h/o rheumatic fever 11) CRI, baseline Cr 1.5 12) GERD 13) Impaired glucose tolerance .
Family History: 2 brothers with MI in 70s   Physical Exam: VITAL SIGNS: T 96.2  BP 100/40  HR 85  RR 27 O2 sat 96% on AC 500/26  PEEP 5 FiO2 100% GENERAL: Intubated, sedated HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
Soft, mildly distended.
Compared with the chest radiograph three days ago, there is loss of cardiac silhouette definition bilaterally, with apparent baseline cardiomegaly.
There are multiple focal patchy airspace and increased interstitial opacities bilaterally, compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
However, asymmetric pulmonary edema is also possible.
The hilar contours are less well defined compared to prior, secondary to the underlying patchy opacities.
There is no pneumothorax or no appreciable pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Multiple new patchy airspace and intersitial opacities bilaterally.
This may represent multifocal pneumonia, or possibly CHF.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Moderate distention of gallbladder, cholelithiasis and mild gallbladder wall edema, findings are concerning for acute cholecystitis, correlate clinically.
TTE [**7-18**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls, distal septum, anterior, and lateral walls..
There is a small apical left ventricular aneurysm with dyskinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-12-9**], regional left ventricular systolic function is now depressed (regional)  Brief Hospital Course: 1) Pneumonia Mr. [**Known lastname 19075**] presented with worsening shortness of breath, fevers, and cough and was found to have bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.
2) Myocardial infarction Cardiac enzymes were elevated on presentation.
An echocardiogram was performed and was remarkable for a newly depressed EF of 35% and near akinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls, distal septum, anterior, and lateral walls.
3) Ventricular tachycardia He developed sustained ventricular tachycardia early in the AM of [**7-19**] and became increasingly hypotensive in that setting.
Of note, he had been on levophed and dobutamine earlier in the day for blood pressure support -- and had recently experienced a myocardial infarction.
4) Hypotension He required both vasopressor and inotrope support for blood pressure in the intensive care unit.
We thought his hypotension was related both to sepsis and depressed cardiac function.
5) Acute renal failure His creatinine was elevated to 3.1 on presentation, peaking at 3.8.
Initially thought to be ATN in setting of hypotension.
Urine output was initially poor but improved with dobutamine consistent with poor renal perfusion in setting of depressed cardiac function post-MI.
