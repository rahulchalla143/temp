Admission Date:  [**2177-8-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2177-9-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2156-10-21**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]-INTERNAL MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 20 year old previously healthy man transferred from Bermuda after sustaining a closed head injury secondary to motorcycle crash [**2177-8-4**].
He was unresponsive at that accident site and presented to the Emergency Department with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Score of 3.
He had a right frontal hemorrhagic contusion with numerous skull and facial fractures and air noted within the skull vault.
A liver laceration was noted with blood in the pelvis and the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy.
There were no abnormalities in the spleen or bowel and liver bleeding was stopped after hemostasis with packing.
His hospital course in Bermuda was significant for a three week Intensive Care Unit admission for increased intracranial pressure, urosepsis and minimal improvement in neurological status.
On presentation, he was noted to have a temperature of 101.0 F., copious sputum production, and an arterial blood gas was done in the Emergency Department that showed pH 7.47, pCO2 37, pO2 50.
It was uncomplicated with a fever curve trending downward after being started on Levaquin and Vancomycin.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
Tracheostomy is in place with minimal secretions present.
He had coarse breath sounds bilaterally which may have been secondary to upper airway radiation of sounds.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.
PEG tube site was without signs or symptoms of infection.
His lower extremities were in multi-Podes boots with his right calf and heel in dressings with no drainage noted.
He does not move his right upper extremity or right lower extremity and will occasionally have non-spontaneous movement of the left upper extremity and lower extremity.
There is no tracking with pupils noted.
Repeat urine culture [**2177-9-4**], showed no growth.
Sputum culture [**2177-8-31**], Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to Ciprofloxacin.
Chest x-ray [**2177-8-30**], bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Head CT scan on [**2177-8-30**], right frontal encephalomalacia, multiple facial fractures, no abscess, no midline shift, no intracranial hemorrhage.
EEG [**2177-9-2**], moderate diffuse encephalopathy with background 6 to 7 Hz.
MRI of the brain / cervical spine [**2177-9-3**]:  Right frontal and temporal contusion and evidence of multiple areas of shear injuries.
Complex facial fractures with destruction of cribriform plate.
Cervical spine normal.
CT scan of the right maxillofacial area [**2177-9-4**], multiple orbital fractures including the floor, compression of ethmoid cells.
Depression of cribriform plate.
IMPRESSION:  20 year old with closed head injury status post motor vehicle crash [**2177-8-4**].
The patient is comatose with minimal neurologic improvements over the last month.
He has shown very minimal progress in neurologic symptoms and will occasionally withdraw to pain.
He is unresponsive and sporadically moves his left extremities with non-purposeful movements.
The MRI showed significant damage to the frontal and temporal lobes with destruction of the right ethmoid sinus.
The family understands that the patient's prognosis remains poor with zero to 15% chance of any meaningful recovery.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient with a history of sepsis at outside hospital believed to be urosepsis secondary to enterococcus.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 188**], he had a temperature spike to 101.0 F. with a white count of 16.
He was started empirically on Vancomycin and Levaquin and urine cultures grew enterococcus again.
As sensitivity showed enterococcus was pan sensitive, Vancomycin was discontinued and he was continued on a course of Levaquin.
Sputum cultures were also performed while in the Intensive Care Unit and showed growth of Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus.
Ceftazidime was administered for double coverage of Pseudomonas until sensitivities returned.
His fever curve also trended downward and he was afebrile for greater than 48 hours prior to discharge.
A repeat urine culture was performed [**2177-9-3**], and showed no growth.
They recommended a dedicated maxillosinus CT scan which showed multiple fractures and mucocele in the left maxillary sinus.
He had a strong cough and was able to clear most secretions on his own except for at night where he required suctioning approximately three to four times.
He was treated for Pseudomonas pneumonia as described above.
The line was placed on [**2177-9-2**], without complications.
He had mild transaminitis on admission which was likely secondary to liver laceration he sustained in the motor vehicle crash.
PODIATRY:  The Podiatry Team was consulted secondary to right heel superficial ulceration.
There were no signs of infection in the area.
There was some serosanguinous drainage also on the right calf during admission which was managed conservatively with frequent dressing changes.
Motor vehicle crash [**2177-8-4**], leading to closed head injury and significant brain injury.
Enterococcus urinary tract infection.
