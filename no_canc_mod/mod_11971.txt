HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old white male with coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarctions, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting x 4, with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, who had a left femoral-tibial bypass graft in [**2128-12-12**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient was readmitted to the podiatry service in [**2129-12-12**] for cellulitis of his left foot secondary to a cast.
The patient sustained a third-degree burn to the posterior right leg after using a heating pad approximately seven to 10 days prior to admission.
There was debate about patient's right leg circulation because there were no palpable pulses, and there was a question of whether the patient could heal the Achilles tendon area at all.
Diabetes mellitus since age 25:  With triopathy; status post laser treatment OU; and Charcot joint deformities.
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 2.0.
Peripheral vascular disease.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for diabetes mellitus.
He has a history of industrial exposure to asbestos.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  Alert, cooperative white male in no acute distress.
Skin:  Warm and dry, no rashes on the trunk; a red rash on the lower legs, right greater than left.
No lower teeth.
No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
No masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  Right lower extremity had a dry eschar on the posterior leg from heel to mid calf, approximately 4 cm wide x 12 cm long.
No cellulitis.
Left lower extremity had a Charcot deformity foot.
Well-healed surgical incisions.
Right posterior tibial pulse had very faint Doppler signal.
Abdominal aorta nonpalpable.
Chest x-ray showed no acute pulmonary disease.
Left atrial abnormality.
No significant change since last EKG.
Cultures of his right lateral foot ulcer were taken.
Cardiology was consulted for preoperative clearance.
An echocardiogram was done which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy, basal inferior hypokinesis, and an ejection fraction of 40%.
The patient complained of new onset of nausea and vomiting during hospitalization.
The gastroenterology service felt that the elevated liver function tests could be due to levofloxacin or the patient's amiodarone.
The patient received Mucomyst before his arteriogram because of his chronic renal insufficiency.
Post angiogram the patient complained of being short of breath.
He had decreased O2 saturations.
His chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.
The patient had received preangiography IV hydration as well as fresh frozen plasma and his congestive heart failure was felt to be secondary to volume overload per the cardiology service.
The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on [**2129-5-9**] which spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm.
Cardiology agreed with stopping amiodarone secondary to elevated liver function tests.
The patient was found to have iron deficiency anemia.
The patient had previously scheduled ultrasound graft surveillance of his left bypass graft on [**2129-5-16**], which showed a patent graft with no evidence of narrowing.
At the end of surgery the patient had a palpable dorsalis pedis graft pulse.
Postoperatively the patient had some hallucinations and delirium which cleared by postoperative day four.
On [**2129-5-24**] the patient underwent debridement of the eschar on his right posterior leg under monitored anesthesia care.
However, the wound was granulating well following bypass graft surgery and debridement.
His posterior right leg wound was clean and granulating well.
He had a palpable dorsalis pedis graft pulse.
The arm and leg incision staples should be removed on postoperative day number 14, which is [**2129-6-3**].
The patient had another episode of elevated blood pressure.
b.i.d., hold for loose stool.
Ischemic right leg with burn of posterior leg secondary to heating pad.
Debridement of right posterior calf eschar on [**2129-5-24**].
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Congestive heart failure secondary to fluid overload.
Blood loss anemia.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Elevated liver function tests secondary to amiodarone and possibly levofloxacin.
