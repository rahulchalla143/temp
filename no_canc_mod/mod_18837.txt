He may have increased sodium intake recently at a family party as he reports cheese and crackers while at the beach over the weekend.
He reports having intermittent, diffuse abdominal pain since his lymph node resection/ ex-lap/ appendectomy which was complicated by wound infection.
He also reports one episode of non-bloody emesis this morning.

Family History: Mother died of MI at 65 yo  Physical Exam: ON ADMISSION: VS: 97.4, 102, 112/77, 18, 100% on RA GEN: pt comfortable, conversant, in no acute distress HEENT: sclera non-icteric, moist mucus membranes, no LAD, no increased JVP CV: RRR, S1, S2, no murmurs/rubs/gallops LUNGS: CTA b/l, no wheezes/rales/rhonchi ABD: +BS, soft, distended, abdomen dullness to percussion, abdominal wall edema, large healing ex-lap wound, pink, clean, with granulation tissue; slightly TTP diffusely, no rebound or guarding EXT: 1+ LE edema, no clubbing, no cyanosis, NEURO: A&Ox3, no asterixis .
MICRO: Stool Cx ([**2153-9-7**]): no C. diff Peritoneal fluid Cx ([**2153-9-6**]: no growth Urine Cx ([**2153-9-5**]): no growth .
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without concern for ileus or obstruction.
Portable CXR ([**2153-9-3**]): 1) New large left pleural effusion and left basilar opacity, could reflect infection with parapneumonic effusion and/or compressive atelectasis.
2) Probable small right pleural effusion and right basilar consolidation.
3) Mild volume overload.
Worsening adenopathy throughout the abdomen, most heavily concentrated in the periaortic region.
There are also enlarged lymph nodes in the paratracheal, pericardial, and epicardial regions.
This diffuse lymphadenopathy has increased since the comparison CT from [**2153-2-5**], and is concerning for progression of the known lymphomatous process.
Occlusion of the IVC between the confluence of the iliac veins and the left renal vein, likely secondary to extrinsic compression by the periaortic collection of enlarged lymph nodes.
Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left, with complete collapse of the left lower lobe and partial collapse of the right lower lobe.
Diffuse thickening of the ascending colon suspicious for involvement by the lymphomatous process.
[**9-11**] CT Head: No evidence of bleeding infarct, mass or mass effect.
Valvular regurgitation was not adequately assessed.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 yo man with HCV and EtOH cirrhosis s/p OLT ([**2148**]), c/b ascites who presented with worsening hyponatremia.
# Hyponatremia: Pt was admitted with asymptomatic hyponatremia to 122 found on routine labs.
As per his urine studies, this was likely secondary to his cirrhosis-related intravascular volume depletion.
He was initiated on a trial of Tolvaptan 15mg, which was discontinued due to a rise in his creatinine.
# Renal Failure: Admission creatinine was 1.3, however creat began to rise while on tolvaptan and later while being fluid restricted.
Urine studies were suggestive of a prerenal etiology, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
Tacrolimus was discontinued due to its potential nephrotoxic effects.
# HCV/ETOH Cirrhosis S/P OLT: Tacrolimus was discontinued due to its potential nephrotoxicity, however cellcept was continued, along with bactrim prophylaxis, lactulose, and rifaximin.
# Pneumonia: The pt's WBC increased on [**9-3**] and a CXR was suggestive of pneumonia.
# Abdominal pain: Pt has has intermittent abdominal pain throughout this admission.
Several KUBs have shown a dilated transverse colon but no mechanical obstruction.
Abdominal pain is likely secondary to gas as well as ascites.
The pain has been moderately controlled with simethicone, occasional paracentesis, and HD.
# Tachycardia: The patient has a chronic sinus tachycardia.
EKG is w/o evidence of right heart strain to suggest PE.
It is felt to be due to fluid shifts in the setting of frequent HD and [**Doctor First Name 4397**].
More likely, there was a chronic component complicated by large fluid shifts related to his liver and kidney failures.
# Nausea: Pt has had chronic nausea, likely multifactorial: hyponatremia, medications, uremia, ascites, and infection (an EGD revealed candidal esophagitis) as potential causes.
He received multiple paracenteses to relieve his severe recurrent ascites.
# Nutrition: Secondary to the patient's nausea, he had very poor PO intake.
He has since been switched back to tube feeds but continues to have very poor PO intake.
Over the past week, he has worsening mental status changes, has been consistently tachycardic and was hypotensive during HD.
He ruled out MI and TTE showed collapsing IVC.
The patient received PRBCs and albumin for hemodynamic support.
The patient became progressively tachycardic.
ECHO on [**9-18**] showed EF>55% and only small pericardial effusion.
Pulm: CXR on [**9-3**] was consistent with a large left pleural effusion.
His left pleural effusion was tapped for 1.5L.
On [**9-15**], the patient had increased wheezing after receiving lopressor for tachycardia.
On [**9-18**], the patient was bronched, which showed no evidence of obstruction or thick secretions.
Liver ultrasound showed no abnormalities.
CT TORSO on [**9-11**] was consistent with worsening adenopathy throughout the abdomen, most heavily concentrated in the periaortic region, which is concerning for PTLD.
The patient was restarted on TF intermittently, and stopped intermittently due to inceased residuals.
GU: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome and is listed for a combined liver/kidney transplant.
He has chronic hyponatremia.
The patient received 3uPRBCs on [**9-11**] for decreased hematocrit.
Cortisol stimulation showed no adrenal insuffiency.
Possible causes of sepsis include SBP, PNA, or line infection.
Zofran 4mg q8h PRN nausea 7. oxycodone 5mg 1-2 tabs PO q6h 8.
