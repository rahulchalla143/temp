[**2170-8-17**]: C2-T1 posterior instrumented spine fusion with ICBG.
Symptoms began on Sat 2 days prior when he developed neck stiffness.
[**Name2 (NI) **] morning, he began c/o B/L hand tingling and electric shock pains going down his body.
He developed a fever, and began vomiting and shaking.
His wife notes that he became diffusely weak and was unable to walk straight when he tried to walk.
His wife brought him in a wheelchair to [**Hospital **] Hosp, where his temp was noted to be 103 F. CXR was purportedly suggestive of a mild LLL PNA.
At 2:15 am, [**Hospital1 **] ER reports that he was c/o B/L UE weakness and ongoing neck stiffness and intact MS. At 2:45, neck pain is reported as [**9-22**].
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and obtained an emergent MRI pan-spine showing significant epidural fluid collection, likely blood, possibly infected.
There were also bone marrow changes of unclear etiology, but possibly c/w malignancy.
Of note, his wife reports an unintentional weight loss of 100 lbs over about 3 years.

MRI pan-spine: Predominantly posterior epidural collection from craniocervical junction through T2, with some signal features that suggest the presence of blood, i.e.
this could be an infected epidural hematoma rather than just an epidural phlegmon.
Extensive edema/enhancement in the interspinous ligaments from C1-2 through C4-5, and in the posterior paravertebral soft tissues of the cervical spine, which could indicate traumatic injury or spread of infection.
Not clear if the epidural collection extends into the skull base - suggest head MRI.
Cervical spine CT would also be useful to assess for posterior element fractures.
Cervical spondylosis, worst at C5-6 and C6-7, with spinal cord deformity and abnormal cord signal, could be edema or myelomalacia.
Diffusely abnormal bone marrow signal, could be due to anemia, chronic systemic illness, or infiltrative disorder including infiltrative malignancy.
No focal thoracic spine abnormalities below T2.
Chronic mild L1 compression deformity.
Mild lumbar spondylosis.
Mild epidural edema/enhancement surrounding a disc bulge at L1-2, likely reactive inflammation as there is no evidence of diskitis/osteomyelitis at this level.
A/P: 47 M w/ hx IVDA, Hep C, alcoholism, COPD, with significant throbmocytopenia, presented from [**Hospital **] Hosp with 3 days neck pain and 1 day of fever to Tmax 105 F, vomiting, malaise, B/L hand parasthesiae and shooting electric pains down his body, found with significant epidural fluid collection from craniocervical junction to T2, thought to be blood, possibly infected (which seems likely given raging fever).
Exam now seems c/w quadraplegia, and the acuity of his change can certainly be seen with epidural abscess.
MS at least minimally intact and CN's appear intact, though he had some dyscongugate eye movements.

Partially visualized left lung nodule, likely a partially visualized focus of ground-glass opacity similar on CT [**2170-8-8**].

Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You have undergone the following operation: Posterior Cervical Decompression and Fusion C2-T1 for epidural abscess.
If the incision is draining cover it with a new sterile dressing.
If the incision starts draining at anytime after surgery, do not get the incision wet.
If you have an incision on your hip please follow the same instructions in terms of wound care.
Please allow 72 hours for refill of narcotic prescriptions, so please plan ahead.
