His daughter notes that he also has left-sided weakness however she attributes this to previous strokes.

Unusual appearance of a bihemispheric process involving the left temporal and right temporoparietal lobes.
The latter appears more acute, as there was no evidence of such a process on the MR examination obtained less than two weeks ago.
There is a suggestion of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter involvement, this may represent _____ edema related to relatively acute infarction.
The persistent vasogenic edema in the contralateral temporal lobe may relate to evolving hematoma at that site given the lack of enhancement of underlying lesions on the interval MR study, the process is most consistent with infarctions of different ages, perhaps with hemorrhagic conversion on the left, and the bilaterality is most suggestive of embolic events from a central, perhaps cardiac, source.
[**11-7**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Probable right arm-left arm reversed  Right bundle branch block ST-T wave changes Since previous tracing, rate increased, QRS wider Suggest repeat tracing and clinical correlation     Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 131 0 134 340/[**Telephone/Fax (2) 70763**]7  [**11-8**] Head CT: Resolving hematoma in the left temporal lobe with vasogenic edema.
Low attenuation in the right temporoparietal lobe, also likely represent a subacute infarct, with possible petechial hemorrhage versus gelatinous/proteinaceous material.
Followup is recommended to evaluate for hemorrhagic conversion.
[**11-8**] ECHO: Markedly dilated atria in the setting of atrial fibrillation.
Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional/global biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Small pericardial effusion.

Found to have a subacute stroke (event likely last night) in right posterior MCA territory.
Head CT with an area of new edema in right posterior MCA territory; c/w subacute infarct and left temporal hemorrhage (old).
History of seizure-continued phenobarbitol.
# CV: Patient was in atrial fibrillation with RVR in ED that was responsive to fluids.
Elevated troponin- Likely [**12-30**] afib and worry of an acute ischemic event is low.
Patient remained afebrile since switching to ceftriaxone.
# WOUND CARE: Place pt on 1st step select mattress.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Subacute right temporoparietal lobe stroke Urinary tract infection Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Sacral skin breakdown  Secondary diagnosis: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy Left temporal hemorrhage [**2163-10-24**] Hypertension Stroke '[**59**] with resultant left sided deficits Stroke '[**55**] with left eye blindness   Discharge Condition: Neurologically stable.
Left sided weakness (face, arm, leg).
If you have any change in mental status, worsening fevers/chills, worsening weakness or any other worrying symptoms, please call your primary care physician or return to the emergency room.
