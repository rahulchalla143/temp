[**2178-9-29**] GI bleeding study IMPRESSION: No bleeding site identified.
[**2178-10-2**] Unremarkable upper GI series/small bowel follow-through in this patient status post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass  Brief Hospital Course: #BRBPR - Immediately upon presentation, 2 large bore IV's were placed, and aggressive IVF resuscitation was begun.
His coagulopathy was reversed with FFP and Vitamin K. Colonoscopy on HD#2 revealed a large amount of old & new blood throughout the colon.
Repeat colonoscopy on HD#4 revealed diverticulosis but no active bleeding.
Because of a large amount of cecal blood seen on the second colonoscopy, an upper GI series/small bowel follow-through was performed on HD#5, which was unremarkable.
# RLE erythema - Because of a history of recurrent cellulitis, the patient was begun on IV vancomycin upon admission.
Antibiotic was administered through a LUE PICC line after placement was confirmed by x-ray, as the patient had poor peripheral IV access.
Upon transfer to the medical floor, the patient denied fever or chills and erythema of the RLE had markedly improved, without warmth or tenderness.
Vancomycin was discontinued on HD#5 as these skin changes were felt to be more consistent with chronic lymphedema.
# AFib - The patient was monitored on telemetry.
Frequent episodes of AFib with RVR to the 130s required gradual uptitration of the lopressor dose to 75 mg PO TID.
# CAD s/p LAD stent - ASA was held in the setting of GIB.
# Chronic lymphedema - Lasix was held in the setting of hypovolemia and mild hemodynamic instability on admission, but was resumed prior to discharge when the patient's condition had markedly improved.
# PPx - The patient was given twice daily intravenous PPI in the setting of GIB.
He was given pneumatic boots and SQH for DVT prophylaxis.
