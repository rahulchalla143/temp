Patient has AF and had problems with multiple episodes of supratherapeutic INR last 3.3 on [**4-22**] and were holding warfarin at rehab planning to restart at 1mg tonight.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and on presentation to the ED, patient was hypertensive at 188/137 and was noted to be not verbalising and had clear right sided weakness.
His exam somewhat improved regarding his speech which was initially anarthric and felt severe non-fluent aphasia as not verbalising butthsi improved and although difficult to understand was able to name pretty well suggesting mostly dysarthria.
He has a PICC in situ for hydration having finished vancomycin course.
On neuro ROS, difficult to assess but patient grossly denies headache, loss of vision, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.
On general review of systems, grossly difficultto assess but the pt denies shortness of breath or chest pain or nausea.

>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. .
There is an acute, 1.7 x 1.2 cm hematoma in the left thalamocapsular region (2B:56), with a rim of surrounding vasogenic edema.
This mildly effaces the left atrium, but there is no shift of the normally midline structures.
Ventricles and sulci remain enlarged, compatible with age-related involutional changes.
Faint periventricular and subcortical white matter hypointensities reflect small vessel ischemic disease.
There are calcifications in the bilateral cavernous carotid arteries.
Note is made of an atelectatic right maxillary sinus, with inward retraction of the sinus walls and convex lateral bowing of the right nasal cavity.
No current evidence of sinus or infundibular opacification.
Incidental note of a right scleral plaque.
Acute small left thalamocapsular hematoma with surrounding vasogenic edema.
Likely due to hypertension.
Right maxillary sinus syndrome with associated orbital asymmetry.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2196-4-24**] 2:26 PM FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is persistently enlarged and accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion, bilateral small pleural effusions, and adjacent basilar atelectasis.
As compared to the prior study, the right pleural effusion has apparently decreased in size, and both lung bases are slightly better aerated.
The left thalamocapsular region hematoma measures 18 x 13 mm, essentially unchanged from the previous examination, with a rim of surrounding vasogenic edema which is perhaps slightly minimally more apparent, compatible with continued evolution.
No additional sites of hemorrhage are seen.
Ventricles and sulci remain prominent, compatible with age-related involutional changes.
No shift of normally midline structures.
No fracture is seen.
There are periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities, hypodensities are compatible with small vessel ischemic disease.
IMPRESSION:  Continued evolution of left thalamocapsular hematoma with surrounding vasogenic edema without significant change.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral small effusions and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Bibasilar atelectatic change without definite acute pneumonia.
Cardiology: ECG Study Date of [**2196-4-24**]  10:19:20 AM   Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
ECG Study Date of [**2196-4-25**]  8:38:14 AM   Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventericular response.
Compared to tracing #1 ventricular response has slightly increased but the lateral ST-T wave abnormalities are slightly more prominent.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization abnormalities.

Repeat NCHCT stable and HTN now under better controlled and uptitrating his anti-hypertensives.
# Neurology: At rehab, patient had problems with multiple episodes of supratherapeutic INR last 3.3 on [**4-22**] and were holding warfarin at rehab since.
On presentation to the ED, patient was hypertensive at 188/137 and was noted to be not verbalising and had clear right sided weakness.
Initial NIHSS was 17 and patient had what seemed to be a severe non-fluent aphasia although latterly this seemed to represent most likely just significant dysarthria and was initially almost anarthric with no clearly intelligible speech but was gesturing and trying to vocalise without clear words, nodding and shaking head appropriately.
On examination, patient was attending to both sides and had a right facial droop and right arm>leg hemiparesis worse distally in the UE and a right plantar was extensor.
In addition patient had prominent left asterixis.
CT head showed an acute, 1.7 x 1.2 x 2.0 cm left thalamocapsular hemorrhage with minimal edema and no mass effect.
Stroke risk factors were assessed and HbA1c was 4.9% and FLP revealed Chol 173 TGCs 82 HDL 49 LDL 108.
CEs were elevated and stable and there were no new ECG changes and this was attributed to his CRF and possible demand ischemia with discharge TnT 0.12.
In the ICU he clinically improved and although was initially fed with an NG tube he later passed his speech and swallow assessment for a pureed and thin liquid diet.
Repeat NCHCT stable and HTN was better controlled with uptitrating his anti-hypertensives.
His thalamocapsular intraparenchymal hemorrhage is likely hypertensive in aetiology in the setting of a high INR.
# Cardiology: Patient has a history of HTN and non-occlusive CAD.
He had paroxysmal AF on telemetry.
CEs were elevated and stable and there were no new ECG changes and this was attributed to his CRF and possible demand ischemia in the setting of his IPH with discharge TnT 0.12.
# Renal: Patient has CRF and Cr was at baseline ranging from 1.3 to 1.5 and 1.3 on discharge.
# ID: UTI showing mild WBC.
He was noted to have a slight downtrend in his WCC to 3.8 and PLT 181 and this should be trended at rehab.
# GI: Patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis s/p portal shunt in [**2154**] and encephalopathy and seemed encephalopathic on admission with prominent asterixis.
# # GU: Patient had straight cathing for high PVRs.
A urinary catheter was inserted prior to transfer with a plan for a voiding trial at rehab.
Transitional issues: - We stopped warfarin and patient was continued on s/c heparin and aspirin 81mg qd - Up-titrating anti-HTN medications and will need further uptitration at rehab - Catheter inserted on transfer and for voiding trial at rehab - Trend CBC at rehab given slight decrease in WCC and PLT  Medications on Admission: Was on warfarin INR 3.3 on [**4-22**] and holding Acetaminophen 650mg PRN Allopurinol 100mg qd Aspirin 81mg qd Docusate [**Hospital1 **] Lactulose 10ml [**Hospital1 **] Lisinopril 5mg qd Metoprolol tartrate 75mg qid MVI Omeprazole 40mg qd Bisacodyl 10mg PR  qd Senna HS  Discharge Medications: 1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

12. acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Left thalamocapsular intraparenchymal hemorrhage likely hypertensive in aetiology in the setting of a high INR 2.
Dysphagia secondary to above .
Secondary diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation - warfarin stopped and changed to aspirin   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Neurology: Dysarthria and normal mental status with no evidence of aphasia and able to name objects and fully oriented.
Patient has a right facial droop and otherwise cranial nerves unremarkable.
Right arm>leg hemiparesis worse distally in the UE and the right plantar was extensor.
Coordination normal on left and unable to assess due to weakness on the right.
You presented after acute right-sided weakness and garbled speech and you were found to have a bleed on the left side of your brain in an area called the thalamus and extending into another area called the internal capsule.
We felt that this was likely due to high blood pressure and you being on warfarin which increases the risk of bleeding.
You were initially admitted to the Neuro ICU and your blood thinner (warfarin) was reversed to reduce the risk of further bleeding and you were initially treated with an IV medication to lower your blood pressure.
You were found to have swallowing problems and you initially required a feeding tube and latterly after you were seen by the swallowing specialists, you were passed for a pureed and thin liquid diet.
We stopped your warfarin and started aspirin in its place given too high a risk of bleeding on warfarin.
Medication changes: We STOPPED warfarin We REDUCED metoprolol to 50mg four times per day and this will likely need to be increased further Please continue your other medications as prescribed  Followup Instructions: Please see your PCP soon after discharge from rehab.
