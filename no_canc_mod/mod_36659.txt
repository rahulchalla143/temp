CT head [**2109-5-5**] IMPRESSION: 4.4 x 2.1 cm right basal ganglia hemorrhage exerting mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle, but no midline shift or herniation.
No other hemorrhage.
Most likely etiology is a hypertensive bleed, however, a vascular malformation or underlying mass cannot be excluded.
CT head [**2109-5-6**] IMPRESSION: Hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia, with surrounding edema, effacement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and body of the right lateral ventricle, and minimal leftward shift of normally-midline structures.
No intraventricular hemorrhage.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: Allowing for differences in section selection and angulation, there has been no significant change in the large right basal ganglionic hemorrhage or the degree of associated mass effect over the roughly 10.5 hour interval.
CT head [**2109-5-7**] FINDINGS: There is a right basal ganglia hemorrhage measuring 4.4 x 2 cm (2:16), with surrounding vasogenic edema, with no significant interval change compared to recent CT.
There is stable mass effect with effacement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and body of the right lateral ventricle.
There is no evidence of intraventricular, subarachnoid or other parenchymal hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of large acute territorial infarction.
CXR [**2109-5-7**] REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient with shortness of breath.
Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison.
Overall, mediastinal contours are unremarkable except for slight distention of the azygos vein, but again may be attributed to the portable technique of the study and potentially some degree of volume overload.
Lungs are essentially clear except for linear atelectasis at the left lung base and note is made that the right costophrenic angle was not included in the field of view.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen within the limitations of the study that included only part of the chest.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 105252**] was admitted to the neuro ICU for evaluation of weakness on the left side of body and difficulty speaking.
He was found to have left sided hemiparesis, the weakness was more in the arm than lower limb.
The location of bleed in setting of very high blood pressure most likely suggests hypertension as the etiology.
He continued to do well with slight improvements in speech and strenght in his left arm.
Given his aphasia (he is right handed and has a right sided injury) and MRI was obtained to ensure there was no additional damage to the left hemisphere.
On [**2109-5-14**] the patient had a brief episode of non-responsiveness followed by a period of confusion.
An EEG was obtained that was normal, however it was thought that this episode represented a seizure and he was started on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **].
Cards He was constantly monitered  on telemetry and EKG as well as cardiac enzymes were obtained and ruled out for myocardial ischemia.
He should be weaned off the labetalol as tolerates and other BP medications such as the thiazide diuretic should be titrated for BP control.
Chest X ray did not show any evidence of infiltrates or pneumonia.
He was closely monitered for signs of pneumonia.
Ortho: The patient breifly had pain in his right wrist.
There was no recent trauma.
There was full range of motion without and swelling or fluctuance and it appeared to self resolve.
OT/PT [**Name (NI) **] was seen by OT/PT therapist who suggested acute rehab.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Langauge deficits, mulitple paraphasic errors, some naming difficult with low frequecny objects.
Repetition intact CN: L facial droop, L field cut, o/w intact Motor: full a RUE/RLE, On left weak at delt 4+/5, tri 4+/5 and 4 at WE and finger extensors, near full at left LE [**Last Name (un) **]: appears intact    Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a bleed in your brain on the right side in an area called the basal ganglia.
This was likely due to your uncontrolled hypertension.
On the floor you had one episode where you where initially briefly unresponsive and then confused.
If  you have any of the symptoms listed below please call your doctor or return to the nearest emergency room.
