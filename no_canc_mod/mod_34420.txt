Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catherization [**2168-5-23**] s/p Aortic valve replacement (21mm Pericardial) Mitral valve repair (28mm ring) Coronary artery bypass graft (Left internal mammary > left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft > diagonal, saphenous vein graft > posterior descending artery) [**2168-6-8**]   History of Present Illness: 70 year old woman who over the last six months has experienced decline in exercise capacity, becoming short of breath while performing her daily activities.
In [**Month (only) 116**] she was admitted to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital after becoming severely dyspneic, and was found to have a RLL pneumonia.
Her functional capacity was improved on discharge however she noticed continued swelling of her ankles, dyspnea on exertion, a non productive cough, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and developed two pillow orthopnea.
Cadriac workup revealed Aortic Stenosis, Mitral regurg, and coronary artery disease.

Aortic valve disease.
Congenital heart disease.
Coronary artery disease.
Left ventricular function.
Mitral valve disease.
Prosthetic valve function.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Right ventricular function.
Shortness of breath.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity.
Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Results were Conclusions Prebypass  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a well-seated aortic valve bioprosthesis without paravalvular regurgitation and without residual valvular stenosis.
There is well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring with mild residual regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs.[**Known lastname **] was admitted for heart failure requiring aggressive diuresis.
Cardiac work up revealed an aortic valve area of 0.6 and 3+ mitral regurgitation,and coronary artery disease.Preoperatively it was noted that she had candidial intertrigo in the bilateral groin, presenting a risk for infection at the proposed catheter insertion site for surgery, and the surgery was subsequently postponed until her intertrigo resolved with oral diflucan therapy and topical miconazole therapy.
She awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without complications.
On the evening of postoperative day two she was found to be asystolic under the epicardial pacer and EP was consulted.
On post operative day three she was pan cultured for elevated white blood cell count and the blood culture [**12-23**] bottles were positive for staph coag negative from aline, vancomycin was started, ID consulted, and repeat blood cultures obtained.
Epicardial wires were maintained and heparin started due to atrial fibrillation.
POD#11 she was found to be C-Difficile positive and was placed on Flagyl x 14day course.
