Admission Date:  [**2196-1-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-2-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-8-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Codeine / Vicodin / Demerol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**] Chief Complaint: Worsening Dyspnea on Exertion, Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2196-2-2**] Cardiac catheterization [**2196-2-8**]  AVR ( 23 mm CE pericardial)/ MV repair (28 mm [**Company 1543**] CG Future ring)/ CABG X 2 ( LIMA to LAD , SVG to OM)/aortic endarterectomy Hypertension Moderate Aortic Stenosis - valve area of 1cm in [**2188**] (last echo in our system) Mild LVH Gout GERD L3-L5 Laminectomy in [**2192**] Post nasal drips s/p hysterectomy s/p tonsillectomy Pneumonia   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 30016**] is a 77 year old female with a h/o moderate aortic stenosis (valve area 1cm on echo in [**2188**]), HTN, LVH who presents with a few weeks of worsening dyspnea on exertion.
She reports shortness of breath and feeling as though her throat is closing with any amount of activity, about 25 steps, which resolves with rest.
She has also had a wet, nonproductive cough that is worse with deep breathing.
She denies any orthopnea, LE edema, recent illnesses.
She reports the throat tightness being present for past few years, always with exertion and relieved by rest and drinking ice water.
She also has been having intermittent jaw pain, usually associated with the throat tightness, never occurs at rest.
She denies any associated chest pain, but has been very bothered by her "wet", nonproductive cough which only occurs when she takes a deep breath, which she says is a change from prior.
Labs and imaging significant for a troponin of 0.02, BNP of 3456, D-dimer of 438, EKG was sinus tachycardia with a LBBB, with no priors for comparison.
Cardiology was consulted who felt that she was in heart failure likely due to worsening of her AS but could also be ischemic, her symptoms of throat tightening were concerning for angina given that it resolves with rest.
The cardiology fellow felt that her LBBB was likely related to a structural problem, so no need for anti-coagulation at this time.
Also, she is concerned about what she thinks is a fungal infection in her groin area, which she has had in the past and is currently somewhat painful.

CXR [**1-29**]: Bilateral small pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis, unchanged.
Selective coronary angiography revealed moderate LMCA and multivessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD is heavily calcified with mid vessel 40-50% stenosis (relative to calcium shell).
There is a distal short myocardial bridge with systolic compression.
There is mild-moderate diffuse disease apically, a modest D1 and larger D2.
There is proximal-mid tubular ulcerated eccentric 70% stenosis before OM3.
OM3 has a large lower pole with hazy 85%stenosis.
There is a small LPL2, patent LPDA and distal AV groove Cx.
It is a small, nondominant vessel which is mildly moderately diffusely diseased.
It supplies conus and atrial branches.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided filling pressures with RVEDP 9 mmHg and LVEDP 21 mmHg.
There is mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 38 mmHg.
The PCWP is moderately elevated at entry at 18 mmHg.
The cardiac output is minimally depressed with CI 2.46 L/min/m2 (using an assumed oxygen consumption).
There was severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 36 mmHg and a calculated valve area of 0.7 cm2.

Conclusions Prebypass No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.

There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a new mitral annuloplasty ring which appears well-seated.
Immediately postbypass, there was a jet of mitral regurgitation moderate in severity originating from the base of the anterior leaflet just inside the annuloplasty ring, likely around the A3 scallop, consistent with a perforation in the base of the leaflet.
There was also mild regurgitation from the coaptation point.
There is no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet and there is no stenosis (mean gradient 2 mmHg at a CO of 3.6 L/min).
There is also a new bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position which is well-seated without evidence of regurgitation or paravalvular leak.
The anteroseptal wall continues to be dyskinetic with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the septum and apex).
