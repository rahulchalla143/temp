HOSPITAL COURSE:  Miss [**Known lastname 3647**] is a 33-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] initially to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for weight loss, lightheadedness, chest pain, increasing diarrhea in the setting of radiologic evidence for progression of her Crohn's disease.
GI:  Miss [**Known lastname **] symptoms were consistent with an exacerbation of her Crohn's disease.
There was discussion at that time about starting Remicade, however, it was felt best to be deferred given her multiple perirectal abscesses and a questionable infection at that site.
There were no signs of active infection at the time and showed a well healing surgical scar from prior drainage of perirectal abscesses.
Again, on hospital day #4 after surgery and after stabilization of her cardiovascular status she was transferred to the regular floor and continued treatment for Crohn's disease.
On hospital day #6 at the suggestion of the GI consult team, she was taken for flexible sigmoidoscopy which showed ulceration erythema with lesion and cobblestone pattern in the descending colon, rectum and sigmoid colon compatible with a Crohn's disease.

She was not having any abdominal pain with meals and no fevers or chills overnight.
Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with profound hypertension to systolic blood pressure of 80's and was started on Levophed.
It was felt her hypotension was a combination of hypovolemia, anemia, and possible sepsis.
She had no EKG changes throughout the course and no further episodes of chest pain or hypotension throughout the rest of her hospital course.
ID:  Miss [**Known lastname **] profound hypertension and tachycardia was thought also possibly consistent with a sepsis type picture in the setting of a Crohn's flare.

Chronic renal insufficiency:  Miss [**Known lastname 3647**] has history of chronic renal insufficiency felt secondary to Lithium use in the past.
At the time of admission her creatinine of 2.4 was felt secondary to profound hypovolemia.
