Chest x-ray that was questionable left lower lobe infiltrate.
She was seen by Psychiatry at the outside hospital, but noted there was no psychoses, but delirium.
She also had a K of 6.0 and given 30 of Kayexalate, 5 of Haldol, 2 mg of Ativan given for agitation, and 2 mg of ceftriaxone was given for a temperature of 101.3 with a concern for meningitis as a LP was done prior.

Obstructive-sleep apnea ?
Morbid obesity.
Congestive heart failure, unknown EF.
Diabetes mellitus.
Neck:  Obese, unable to assess lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention.
Lungs:  Poor effort, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Chest x-ray:  Left lower lobe basal opacity.
EKG:  Sinus tachycardia at 106 beats per minute, left axis deviation, T-wave inversions in leads I and aVL that are old.
No QRS widening and no peak T waves.
Chest x-ray rotated low lung volumes, hazy opacities at bases.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure issues:  The patient presented with changes in mental status, pCO2 of 100, pH of 7.19, decreasing sats on arrival likely element of obstructive-sleep apnea.
She had admitted to the MICU and had multiple episodes of apnea throughout the night.
Patient improved that her mental status with improvement of her oxygenation and ventilation as well as for correction of her respiratory acidosis.
She only had one episode of apnea on the day prior to discharge.
Delta MS/mental status issues:  Most likely her waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status and hypercarbia/hypoxia compounded by infection of pneumonia and UTI.
With improvements of her ventilation and oxygenation and treatment with levofloxacin of her UTI and pneumonia, her mental status greatly improved on hospital day two without further waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].
Her daughters came by and visited her, and reported that she was at her baseline mental status on the day prior to discharge.
B12, folate, RPR were all sent that were unremarkable as causes for delta MS.  We are awaiting results of the lumbar puncture from the outside hospital, but on hospital day two.
Fever issues:  The patient initially presented with T max of 101.3 at outside hospital with increasing white blood cell counts and a positive urinalysis.
A chest x-ray with bilateral patchy infiltrates likely pneumonia and UTI.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed that showed no hepatic or biliary pathology likely due to acute phase stress changes given the fact that she had no clinical symptoms.
Congestive heart failure history:  Patient was stable without evidence of CHF on chest x-ray.
Followed her sats likely due to obstructive-sleep apnea and hypoventilation.
Patient had no further cardiac issues at this time.
She was on telemetry without any episodes of any rhythm abnormalities.
GYN:  The patient had some vaginal bleeding x2 days.
Patient had a history of fibroids during this hospitalization.
Patient is strongly encouraged to followup with her outside primary care provider to followup for the vaginal bleeding given her history of fibroids and question metaplasia of the endometrium.
She had a history of nucleated RBCs likely secondary to stress and hypoxia during this admission.
Hemolysis laboratories were negative.
FEN:  She was NPO with a decrease in her mental status.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient was stable with complete clearance of her mental status, advancement of her diet, blood pressure, and heart rate remained stable, and her oxygen saturations were well above 90% during the daytime on 2 liters nasal cannula and at night on the BiPAP settings described above.
