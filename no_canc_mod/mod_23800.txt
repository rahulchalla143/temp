Nonperfusing right kidney with 12 mm enhancing structure in right upper pole consistent with pseudoaneurysm, less likely area of active extravasation of contrast.
Large hemorrhage in the bilateral perirenal space.
Hypodensity in the pancreatic body, concerning for contusion or laceration.
Small splenic laceration.
Focal hepatic hypodensity in location typical for focal fat, contusion felt less likely.
Bilateral atelectasis.
Cannot rule out aspiration or early pneumonia.
Left sided rib fractures of indeterminate chronicity.
Following this procedure he required a tunneled line for hemodialysis as he developed acute renal failure.
