He reports that the patient was vomiting and appeared very [**Known lastname **].
Patient reports that the father [**Name (NI) 89612**] "[**Name2 (NI) **]" but was speaking clearly and walking with minimal support.
A head CT revealed extensive, bilateral SAH hence and he was given 1g of fosphenytoin then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Additionally, his BP was 85/44 upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] hence dopamine drip was started and given the poor mental status, he was intubated for airway protection.
HTN 2.
CAD - s/p triple bypass in [**2158**] 3.
BPH s/p TURP in [**2152**] 5.
Family History: Vertigo - no FH of aneurysms or ICH.
Abd: Soft, NT, BS+ Extrem: Dorsalis pedis palpable and no edema.
No abnormal movements.
Spontaneously moves all four limbs without asymmetry with resistance but unable to assess individual muscle groups.
Abd: Soft, NT, BS+ Extrem: Dorsalis pedis palpable and no edema.
Pertinent Results: CT/CTA [**2163-3-22**]: Bilateral SAH but no evidence of IPH or IVH.
No evidence of worsening hydrocephalus.
Similar amount of moderate bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Small intraventricular hemorrhagic extension, unchanged.
CTA/CTP [**2163-3-26**]: IMPRESSION: The patient is status post coiling of an anterior communicating aneurysm, interval placement of ventriculostomy, unchanged intraventricular hemorrhage, interval decrease in the pattern of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No left upper extremity DVT.
Mild subcutaneous edema.
Subacute infarcts involving the bilateral occipital lobes amd right caudate head.
Small foci of restricted diffusion in the cerebellar hemispheres may represent infarcts or blood products.
Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.
Regions of mild to moderate luminal narrowing within the cerebral vasculature, similar to the initial examination, likely reflecting underlying atherosclerosis.
No definite evidence of vasospasm.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage, status post coiling of ACom aneurysm.
Hypodensities in the bilateral occipital lobes and right caudate head consistent with evolving infarctions.
There is no definite CT correlate to the small foci of restricted diffusion seen in the left cerebral hemisphere.
CTA/P [**2163-3-31**]: CTA HEAD: The major branches of the carotid and vertebral arteries are of normal caliber without aneurysm, stenosis, obstruction or vasospasm.
CT PERFUSION: There is a tiny focus of increased mean transit time and decreased blood volume in the left occipital lobe, corresponding to the known infarction.
There is no other region of ischemia or large territorial infarction seen on CT perfusion.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage status post coiling of ACOM aneurysm.
Minimal residual subarachnoid and intraventricular blood.
No evidence of vasospasm.
No evidence of acute ischemia on perfusion imaging.
The patient is in interstitial pulmonary edema, moderate in severity, accompanied by bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis.
Decreased conspicuity of subarachnoid blood at the vertex bilaterally, as well as intraventricular blood in the bilateral occipital horns, compatible with expected evolution of blood products.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
Hypodensity in the bilateral occipital lobes and right caudate head, compatible with evolving infarcts.
No acute territorial infarct is identified.
ACOM coil pack and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Old bilateral parietal watershed infarcts.
Paranasal sinus disease.
A right EVD was place without incident.
He was brought to angiogram and underwent coling of Anterior communicating artery coiling.
He became more lethargic on [**3-26**] a CTA no spasm or profusion mismatch was noted however with bilateral cerebellar infarcts.
On [**3-27**] he was noted to have a diffuse rash on back.
On [**3-28**] and [**3-29**] he remained quite lethargic but was following simple commands with much probing.
A CT on [**3-30**] showed no evidence of vasospasm.
CSF was sent for panel, this showed no growth.
He had a video swallow exam.
He had a slow intake, but no aspiration.
His hematocrits were followed as there was a drop to 23 on [**4-7**] then returned to 29 on [**4-18**] iron had been started.
Neurologically he was making slow progress each day, slightly more interactive able to follow two step commands.
Medications on Admission: None   Discharge Medications: 1. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or T>100.4.
7. senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
10. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: SAH ACOMM Aneurysm   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**7-3**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
