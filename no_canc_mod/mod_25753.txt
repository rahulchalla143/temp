Also noted are mild bibasilar opacities.
The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial edema.
Small left pleural effusion.
Mild bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis, aspiration, and/or pneumonia.
[**11-27**] TTE:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75-80%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Persistent opacities within the lower lungs likely representing a combination of pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation.
As compared to the recent study, the right lower lobe has slightly worsened with increased obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm.
Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful to more fully evaluate this region when the patient's condition permits, particularly to exclude a developing pneumonia at this site.
[**12-6**] CT head: In the left parietal and left frontal regions, there is loss of the normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation, with areas of hypoattenuation compatible with edema from subacute infarction.
There is extensive periventricular hypodensity, most compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, masses, or mass effect.
There is no midline shift or herniation.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent, most compatible with atrophic change.
There is no acute fracture.
IMPRESSION: Areas of loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation, compatible with areas of subacute infarction involving the left frontal and parietal regions.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
[**12-10**] MRI head: There are several confluent areas of high signal intensity on FLAIR and T2-weighted images, consistent with sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemia.
In addition, there is a focal area of high signal intensity present within the left frontal lobe which involves the cortical surface and underlying white matter.
The appearances could represent a subacute or chronic infarct.
There is a small focus of slow diffusion within the left frontal lobe, likely representing an acute infarct.
There is also a chronic left posterior parietal infarct.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Similar foci of high signal intensity are seen within the cerebellum as well as the brainstem on T2 and FLAIR images, most consistent with sequelae of microvascular ischemia.
There is mild mucosal thickening seen in the maxillary sinuses.
The remaining paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable.
There is no abnormal marrow signal.
Extensive changes consistent with sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemia throughout the brain parenchyma.
[**12-11**] carotid ultrasounds: Bilateral mild carotid plaque with bilateral 1-39% stenosis.
Left subclavian steal physiology with reverse vertebral flow.
Pre-steal physiology is also seen on the right suggesting bilateral subclavian disease.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-11-27**], no obvious change, but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes direct comparison.
No obvious vegetations.
[**12-15**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in appearance of the bilateral, right more than left opacities, suggesting pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
No pneumothorax.

Pneumonia and sepsis:  She presented intubated and did well on the ventilator.
On presentation CXR with bilateral opacities concerning for PNA.
Congestive heart failure with hyperdynamic LV.
In setting of repeat fluid boluses on floor secondary to persistent hypotension she again became hypervolemic.
Atrial Fibrillation.
On the floor she experienced episodes of non-responsiveness which prompted transfer back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to concern for cardio-respiratory arrest vs. possible seizure.
This was ultimately felt to be resiratory distress, possibly a mucus plug or conversion into sinus bradycardia in the setting of heavy nodal blockade.
Significant agitation while hospitalized felt to be due to deliriuim in the hospital setting and steroid use.
Source unclear likely lungs vs central venous catheters.
A repeat echocardiogram to further assess valves was ordered and was negative for vegetations.
Asymptomatic hypotension.
On the floor patient experienced intermittent episodes of asymptomatic hypotension with systolic blood pressures ~ 70s x 3days.
Cause of hypotension unclear as random cortisol within normal limits, repeat infectious work-up negative.
Her blood pressure returned to her likely baseline systolics in the 60's-80's and was thought to be downregulation of her alpha receptors while on neosynephrine.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 246**] Nursing Center - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Community Acquired Pneumonia, Sepsis, Atrial fibrillation, Congestive heart failure Secondary Diagnosis: COPD exacerbation, Depression, Anxiety   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted with a severe pneumonia requiring intubation and admission to the intensive care unit.
However, you required extra days in the hospital to control your atrial fibrillation, to regulate your blood pressure, and to treat a heart failure exacerbation.
