Left-sided subdural hematoma with associated 8-mm rightward subfalcine herniation as well as small subarachnoid component within the left frontal and temporal lobes.
Left-sided subgaleal hematoma.
Rounded hyperdense lesion abutting the left cerebellum likely representing a meningioma but not fully characterized.
[**11-20**] CT Head: FINDINGS:  A large subgaleal hematoma again overlies the left frontal and temporal bones.
A moderate-sized subdural hematoma again layers over the left cerebral convexity and extending along the left tentorium and falx.
This hematoma measures at least 13 mm in greatest dimension and overall is unchanged in size compared to the previous examination.
A small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage is again seen within the left frontal and left temporal lobes is also unchanged in distribution.
There is mild associated rightward shift of normally midline structures of approximately 5 mm and this is overall not significantly changed compared to the previous examination.
Diffuse effacement of the sulci within the left cerebral hemisphere is noted.
A 1.8 x 1.8 cm heterogeneous but predominantly hyperdense lesion is again noted within the lateral aspect of the left cerebellum, not fully characterized.
The soft tissues, osseous structures and visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are grossly unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  Largely unchanged left-sided subdural hematoma with associated 5 mm of rightward shift in addition to subarachnoid hemorrhage within the left frontal and temporal lobes.
1.8 cm heterogeneous hyperdense mass within the cerebellum most likely represents a meningioma.
Again seen is a moderate-sized subdural hematoma layering over the left cerebral convexity and extending along the left tentorium and falx, measuring 13 mm in greatest diameter.
There is a persistent small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage within the posterior frontal and temporal lobes.
Subfalcine herniation and 6 mm of midline shift are also unchanged.
Heterogeneously enhancing 1.8- cm lesion within the left lateral cerebellar hemisphere is redemonstrated.
Large subgaleal hematoma along the left frontal and temporal bones is stable.
There is minimal opacification within the left sphenoid sinus and right mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:  Unchanged left subdural hematoma with 6 mm of rightward midline shift and subarachnoid hemorrhage within the frontal and temporal lobes.
Unchanged 1.8-cm heterogeneous left cerebellar mass which likely represents a meningioma.
[**2123-11-21**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Patient is status post left frontal, parietal and temporal bones craniotomy and evacuation of left convexity subdural hematoma.
Small amount of extra-axial blood is seen along the left cerebral hemisphere, adjacent to the falx and layering on the tentorium.
The degree of rightward shift of normally midline structures (5 mm), effacement of the left cerebral hemisphere sulci and compression of the left lateral ventricle is unchanged.
Small amount of subarachnoid blood is seen within the left vertex, unchanged.
1.8 cm lesion, likely a meningioma within the left lateral cerebellar hemisphere is redemonstrated.
Expected postoperative pneumocephalus as well as left subgaleal scalp hematoma are identified.
IMPRESSION:  Status post craniotomy and evacuation of left subdural hematoma.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
[**2123-11-22**] CT Head Without Contrast: FINDINGS: Patient is status post left frontal, parietal, and temporal bones craniotomy with evacuation of the left convexity subdural hematoma.
There is decrease in the subdural air since the prior study.
No new areas of hemorrhage visualized.
Again visualized is a subdural hematoma along the falx.
The left frontoparietal subgaleal hematoma is unchanged in thickness and size.
IMPRESSION: Status post left frontoparietal, temporal lobe subdural hematoma with decrease in the subdural air and decrease in the midline shift since the prior study.
No new areas of hemorrhage identified.
The patient is status post left frontal, parietal, and temporal bone craniotomy and evacuation of left convexity subdural hematoma.
A small amount of extra-axial blood is seen along the left cerebral hemisphere, adjacent to the falx and layering on the tentorium.
A small amount of subarachnoid blood is again seen in the left vertex, essentially unchanged from [**2123-11-21**].
Again a 1.9-cm lesion is seen in the left lateral cerebellar hemisphere consistent with a meningioma.
Expected postoperative pneumocephalus has decreased and there is a persistent left subgaleal scalp hematoma.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are essentially normally aerated.
IMPRESSION:  Status post craniotomy and evacuation of left subdural hematoma, similar to prior CT but with reduced pneumocephalus.
No new hemorrhage identified.
[**2123-11-30**] CT Head Without Contrast: FINDINGS: There is small left subdural fluid with hemorrhage layering within, with a transverse dimension of 6mm.
Ther eis mild shift of midline structures, unchanged.
Sudural blood layering on the tentorium and adjacent to the falx has decreased in size as has the subarachnoid blood seen in the left vertex.
CONCLUSION:  No new hemorrhage, evolution of preexisting subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage.
brought to the OR for a left sided subdural hematoma evacuation.
Post operative CT shows a small amount of extra-axial blood is seen along the left cerebral hemisphere, adjacent to the falx and layering on the tentorium.
She also had a incidental small meningioma noted.
She had no further seizures confirmed by 24 hour EEG.
On the evening of [**12-1**] the patient's family notified the primary team that they were not aware that comfort measures only meant no nutrition and a morphine drip to keep the patient comfortable.
Mrs.[**Known lastname 75987**] family decided that it would be okay to consent to a temporary intubation at this point and a Code Blue was initiated for respiratory distress.
After having a long discussion with the family, they decided that she would remain intubated for a temporary amount of time with the intention of extubation in the near future.
The were adamant about not having heroic measures including using a defibrillator or performing chest compressions, however they were amenable to using vasoactive agents to get her cardiac function back to normal.
The family was made aware that the patient had little chance of survival and the premise of comfort measures only was thoroughly explained.
The family made the decision at that time to extubate the patient and make her comfort measures only which was explained to them as putting the patient on a morphine drip, with IV boluses of morphine as necessary for incidental pain, dyspnea or agitation; ativan as necessary for agitation and a scopolamine patch for increased respiratory secretions.
