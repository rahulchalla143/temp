In [**2169-8-10**], he noticed dyspnea and chest tightness with exertion which resolves with rest.
An echocardiogram was performed at that time which showed moderate to severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.9cm2 with a peak/mean gradient of 59/39mmHg respectively.
He elected to winter in [**State 108**] and address his aortic stenosis upon his return.

The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
He developed brief, non-sustained periods of afib which were treated with increased betablocker and oral amiodarone.
By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
