Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.5 to 1.8  PHYSICAL EXAM IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT: VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 100.2?????
CARDIOVASCULAR:  No murmurs, rubs or gallops, S1, S2.
The patient had a left foot ulcer and pink muscle below can be visualized.
She was found to have a urinary tract infection with Escherichia coli greater than 100,000 colonies forming in it.
Urinary tract infection and gram positive cocci in her blood, 2 of 4 bottles, which at the current time have been identified as being coagulase negative.
The patient ruled in for non Q wave myocardial infarction as well, having CPKs of 197 and troponin of 4.3, peak troponin of 11.6.
Urine cultures - Escherichia coli greater than 100,000 on [**2167-7-12**].
Urinalysis had moderate leukocyte esterase, 11 to 20 white blood cells, few bacteria.
Smear showed hypochromasia and microcytosis.
ADMISSION IMAGING:  Chest x-ray at the time of admission - stable cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure, linear markings in lingula consistent with atelectasis.
Electrocardiogram - sinus bradycardia 63 beats per minute, PR prolongation, left axis deviation, AV conduction delay.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with poor R-wave compression, no acute changes from previous studies with exception of increased ST depression, T-wave #1 with slight increase and ST depression and T-wave inversion in AVL suggesting possible lateral ischemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a past medical history of myocardial infarction, status post coronary artery bypass graft, peripheral vascular disease, status post left bypass graft, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 17%, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident x2, lower extremity cellulitis, foot ulcer on left foot, osteomyelitis of left calcaneus, spontaneous left calcanectomy, tracheostomy, chronic renal insufficiency who presented to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital with decreased blood pressure resistant to intravenous fluids with gram negative rods/Escherichia coli and urinary tract infection with greater than 100,000 colonies forming and positive cocci and clusters at this time, coagulase negative, pairs and in clusters in blood cultures was a rule in non Q-wave myocardial infarction, post troponin, negative MB fraction of CKs, coronary artery disease, non Q-wave myocardial infarction.
She does not tolerate them due to chronic renal insufficiency.
The patient has sublingual nitrates prn, is not receiving po nitrates, Isordil on a regular basis due to slightly low blood pressure.
Congestive heart failure - The patient is on 40 mg of Lasix po qd.
Renal - chronic renal insufficiency - The patient's creatinine has improved since her admission.
The patient requires 11 more days of treatment after discharge for urinary tract infection.
Cultures and sensitivities are pending final identification and sensitivity of the gram positive rods and pairs and clusters found in her blood.
Vancomycin 1 gm qd intravenous for gram positive bacteremia, pending for today and probably tomorrow.
Tylenol prn for fever and pain  FOLLOW UP LABS THAT NEED TO BE CHECKED TODAY: 1.
I can be [**Name (NI) 653**], [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 24484**], beeper #39-515, and I will gladly look for you to see if the results have come back from the lab in terms of the specific identification and sensitivities of the organism, most likely Staphylococcus epidermis, but we do not have a positive ID, nor a positive sensitivity on the organism as of yet.
Vancomycin level should be checked today at 4 p.m. prior to giving the patient 1 gm of vancomycin intravenous today and then dosing of the vancomycin if she remains should remains on it should be based on that level that is drawn today or the patient may be switched to less broad coverage based on the return if it is Staphylococcus epidermis and it makes sense that the source would be Staphylococcus epidermis given not a contaminant for the gram positive cocci given the lesions on the patient's leg, the scratching and the cellulitis that she had had.
