MICROBIOLOGY  [**2190-10-30**] - [**Year (4 digits) **] Cultures NGTD [**2190-10-30**] - Urine Cultures NGTD [**2190-10-31**] - MRSA negative [**2190-10-31**] - Influenza A/B - negative     Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 76883**] is a 77 year old woman with a history of chronic pulmonary fibrosis on chronic prednisone therapy who has had a significant functional decline since [**2190-5-17**] when she underwent an abdominal surgery to correct a colocovescicular fistula that presented four day ago to the ED with unresponsiveness.
The neurology service felt that he patient's intermittent unresponsiveness improved with naltrexone was clearly medication-related, with no need for repeat head CT and no concern for seizure activity, with no need to continue Keppra.
Low dose gabapentin and hydromorphone were added for pain control in accordance with the recommendations of the chronic pain team.
After further discussion with the patient's family, it was noted that the patient's mental status changes were first noted the day after she started fluconazole.
It was hypothesized that a pharmacokinetic interaction between methadone and fluconazole, with fluconazole increasing methadone levels, might be responsible for the patient's episodes of unresponsiveness.
An EEG was done consistent with diffuse slowing without epileptiform activity.
* Pneumonia: CXR showed multifocal pneumonia.
The patient was swabbed for influenza and treated with oseltamivir until the swab came back negative.
The patient was continued on the antibiotics she came in on, cefepime and vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin was added for double pseudomonas coverage given radiograph was concerning for worsened pneumonia.
She remained afebrile >24 hours after cessation of antibiotic therapy.
She should have a follow up chest radiograph in [**3-22**] weeks to document resolution of her pneumonia.
The patient was seen by neurosurgery who did not recommend any intervention but wanted to have outpatient neurosurgery follow-up.
Patient will also have outpatient ID follow-up  * Pain Patient was on methadone and gabapentin for pain control on admission.
After her mental status improved she was started on IV dilauded and restarted on gabapentin per the pain service's recommendations.
On the floor she was transitioned to po hydromorphone with improvement in symptoms and no further episodes of unresponsiveness.
* Leg Pain Patient complained of severe [**9-25**] left upper leg pain upon leaving the ICU and arriving on the floor.
A radiograph was done that showed no evidence of a fracture.
* Chronic Normocytic Anemia: The patient's hematocrit remained stable while in the hospital ranging from 24.4 to 27.3.
* Skin Ulcers: The wound care service was consulted and made recommendations for local care.
* Nutrition: Speech and swallow evaluated the patient for dysphagia and recommended a diet of thin liquids and pureed then soft solids with pills taken whole with purees.

Discharge Instructions: You came into the hospital after several episodes of unresponsiveness.
Several tests were done and no cardiac or neurological etiology of your episodes was found.
We believe that these episodes were a result of methadone stacking in the context of the fluconazole that you were taking for the infection in your spine.
For the infection in your spine we would like you to continue to take the fluconazole.
We have a follow-up appointment set up for you with an Infectious disease doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1096**] who will help you to determine the appropriate management of this infection and duration of treatmment.
For the compression fracture in your back, we encourage you to continue to wear the TLSO brace when sitting up at > 30 degrees.
You also came into the hospital on antibiotics for an pneumonia that you acquired during a previous hospitalization.
A radiograph was done that showed no evidence of a fracture.
Your symptoms are most consistent with sciatica.
To manage your pain we recommend the following treatment: - Tylenol 1000mg three times a day - Lidocaine patches 5% 12 hours on; 12 hours off - Hydromorphone 0.5mg po every three hours for breakthrough pain or when you are having your wound dressings changed  Please continue your prednisone for your rheumatoid arthritis and lung disease.
For your depression and anxiety we recommend that you continue your citalopram and we started you on mirtazapine, which should both help your mood and also your appetite.
You should seek immediate medical attention should you develop any chest pain, SOB, tingling or numbness in your lower extremities, or incontinence or any other concerning symptoms.
