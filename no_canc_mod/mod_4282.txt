Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  revealed mild coronary artery disease.

The RCA had mild disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP 11 mmHg.
There was evidence of moderate systolic pulmonary artery hypertension with PASP of 46 mmHg.
There was evidence of mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension with SBP 146 mmHg.
There was no transvalvular gradient upon pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta.
Resting ventriculogram revealed mild global hypokinesis with an EF of 45% and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Mild coronary artery disease.
Global hypokinesis.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
Elevated right sided filling pressures.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Probable diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
CT C/A/P: A large hiatal hernia persists with a small left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta and its branches are noted, though the abdominal aorta remains of normal caliber.
Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are of normal caliber and there is no free air, free fluid, or pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
No retroperitoneal fluid collection or hematoma is identified.
A moderately large fat-containing midline abdominal hernia is reidentified.
No pathologically enlarged inguinal lymph nodes or free fluid is identified.
A hematoma in the right groin is not significantly changed compared to a day prior and no increase in its size is identified.
The previously identified distal left common femoral artery occlusion is not evaluated on the non-contrast images.
Bone windows reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Multilevel thoracolumbar degenerative change and mild compression deformity of the T12 vertebral body is reidentified.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or worsening of right groin hematoma.
Small left pleural effusion and lower lobe atelectasis in the  setting of large hiatal hernia again noted.

EKG with T wave inverisons throughout.
She was transfered here to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization which showed essentially clear coronaries.
Likely cause of elevated troponins and EKG changes was coronary vasospasm that caused transient, reversible ischemia resulting in acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure.
Following the cath, patient developed a cath site hematoma and subsequently became hypotensive to the 70's and had a hct drop from 27 to 21.
CT showed a right common femoral artery 5 x 2 cm hematoma, without evidence of active extravasation or interval expansion following delayed imaging.
On [**11-18**] her Hct dropped down to 21.1 (was originally in the low 30's) and she became hypotenisve to the 80's and she was transfered to the CCU for closer monitoring.
A repeat CT at that time showed no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or worsening of right groin hematoma.
Her BP meds were held in the setting of hypotension and restarted upon transfer to the floor where she was stable.
CAD: Patient with history of prior MI, echo at OSH showing 40% EF (unknown prior), with hypokinesis in an unknown location.
Clinically was in heart failure at OSH and was diuresed to 98% on RA.
Of note, she history of myositis with elevated CK's.
Likely cause of elevated troponins and EKG changes was coronary vasospasm that caused transient, reversible ischemia resulting in acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure.
Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: EF 50% on echo here.
Lasix was discontinued as patient continued to have clinical signs of volume overload with crackles on lung exam in spite of IV lasix.
# Hypotension:  Occurred in setting of hematocrit drop and hematoma at cath site.
Transfered to CCU for closer monitoring where she received a total of 4 units pRBC with stabilization of her HCT and of her blood pressure.
She was transfered back to the floor after 24 hours of stable hct and vital signs.
# Acute on Chronic Anemia:  Has baseine anemia of chronic disease and had hct drop 27 to 21 in setting of hematoma at cath site.
Ventricular Ectopy: Patient had no history of arrythmia.
Likely occurred because of pressure and patient's long time treatment with oral steroid for her polymyositis.
HTN: Hypotension as above, blood pressure medications held as above and restarted as above.
Added ACE-I as above given heart failure.
Diabetes Type II: Per patient, no history of diabetes though outside hospital records indicate that she does.
Cortisone 1 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for itching.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with labs suggestive of a heart attack and an abnormal EKG.
You had a cardiac catheterization that showed no coronary artery disease.
There is no clear cause of your heart failure exacerbation.
This medication is helpful in prolonging life in people with heart failure.
If you have shortness of breath, chest pain, severe abdominal pain, high fever, dizziness or lightheadedness or any other concerning symptom, please seek medical care immediately.
