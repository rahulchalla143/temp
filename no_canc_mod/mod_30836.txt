Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: This is an 87 year old gentleman with afib, CVA, GI bleed, AS, iron dificiency anemia who presented to an OSH s/p fall and on TTE was found to have aortic stenosis.
He reports that he believes that while standing he felt light-headed which caused him to fall.
He believes he had transient loss of consciousness after the fall.
He denied CP, palpitations, melena, hematochezia at the time.
He does report shortness of breath that has been worsening over time.
He is unsure of how far he can walk, b/c he simply does not walk frequently anymore, limited by generalized fatigue.
At the OSH, he was initially admitted for managment and evaluation of mechanical fall and failure to thrive.
A chest xray revealed bilateral pleural effusions.
He subsequently had a CT of the chest which confirmed significant bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, old granulomatous disease and an enlarged heart.
A thoracentesis was performed under ultrasound and 1050 cc of clear yellow fluid was drained consistent w/ transudate effusion.
Gram stain and culture of the pleural fluid were negative.
A TTE demonstratd aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation.
He was comfortable and denied CP, shortness of breath at rest.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, he denies any prior history of myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denied recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denied exertional buttock or calf pain.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - atrial fibrillation - CVA - GI bleeding - Aortic Stenosis - Iron Deficiency Anemia - BPH - Asthma - GERD  Social History: -Tobacco history: negative, quit 50 years ago -ETOH: 3 beers per week -Illicit drugs: Lives in [**Hospital3 **] alone since his wife died in [**Month (only) 359**] [**2119**].
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
2/6 systolic ejection murmur loudest at RUSB.
Poor air movement, w/ decreased breath sounds at bilateral lung bases and crackles to mid lung fields bilaterally.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
There is a clean and dry dressing on the left shin .
IMAGING: [**2120-5-4**] CXR: FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, but there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
Moderate pleural effusions persist bilaterally, right greater than left, with adjacent basilar atelectasis and/or consolidation.
Mild-to-moderate gastric distension is seen in the upper abdomen.
[**2120-5-3**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial injury.
AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Severe calcific aortic stenosis.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
[**2120-5-7**]: VIDEO SWALLOW EVALUATION: FINDINGS: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx without evidence of a stenosis.
There was aspiration with thin barium as well as penetration with all consistencies of barium administered.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 931**] is an 87 year old gentleman with afib, history of stroke (CVA), GI bleed, aortic stenosis, iron deficiency anemia who presented to an OSH status post fall and was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for aortic valve replacement.
He was felt not to be a surgical candidate due to poor nutritional status.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Nutrition: He presented with malnutrion and cachexia.
He was allowed to eat again, knowing that he would continue to aspirate and that this would come with complications such as pneumonia or large aspiration leading to hypoxia and cardiac arrest.
When he was NPO awaiting the decisions of the family, he became hypernatremia to 151 (see below).
The family understands that he is not taking in enough fluids PO to prevent hypernatremia and that the hospice facility will not supply IV fluids.
# AORTIC STENOSIS: Severe aortic stenosis with valve area 0.8 and peak gradient 4.2 m/s.
He was diuresed for 3 days with lasix 20 mg PO daily with acetazolamide 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] with a net negative of 2.5 L and resolution of his respiratory distress.
TTE also demonstrated preserved ejection fraction and prior cardiac cath at an outside hospital showed no significant coronary artery disease.
He was evaluated by Cardiac surgery and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] independently re: surgical repair, however, based upon overall nutritional status and respiratory difficulty, he was not a candidate for open valve replacement, core valve, or valvuloplasty.
It was felt that since his symptoms (respiratory distress) responded well to medical therapy and he was a poor surgical candidate, it would be more reasonable to manage him conservatively.
Continued his metoprolol succinate 75 mg daily, furosemide 20 mg PO once daily prn shortness of breath.
# BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS: The patient was monitored in the CCU after concern on the floor for worsening respiratory status.
He also developed a contraction alkalosis in the setting of diuresis with the effusions making it difficult for him to adjust his respiratory to compensate.
In the setting of an elevated BNP, it was felt that the patient's heart failure was related to aortic stenosis and not a primary lung process.
Atrial Fibrillation w/ ventricular rate controlled.
He is not anticoagulated in the outpatient setting due to history of GI bleed while on warfarin.
He was symptomatic with decreased alertness and delirium.
CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # ANEMIA: Blood work prior to transfer reveals hematocrit of 27.4 and remained stable during admission.
Known iron deficiency anemia.
# DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Continued celexa.
# Gastroesophageal reflux disease:  discontinued omeprazole and tums prn.
Not eating much to cause reflux # Benign prostatic hypertrophy:  discontinued finasteride, has a foley in place.
3. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram Powder in Packet Sig: One (1) Powder in Packet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipaton.
6. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for contstipation.
8. morphine 10 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: 2.5-10 mg PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for pain, shortness of breath.
9. furosemide 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
10. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for agitation, discomfort.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Community Hospice House  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS chronic aspiration failure to thrive aortic stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having difficulty breathing.
You had fluid collected around your lungs due to the heart failure making it difficult to get a full breath.
Your aortic stenosis was managed with diuresis and your respiratory status returned to [**Location 213**].
After discussions with you and your family, it was decided that a feeding tube would not help with possible aspirations and so you should eat whatever you want to continue nutrition.
The following changes were made to your medications: - STOP all of your medications except: - metoprolol succinate 75 mg daily to control your heart rate - senna and docusate 1-2 tabs twice daily as needed for constipation - acetaminophen (Tylenol) 650 mg per mouth or rectum every 6 hours for pain - morphine sulfate oral solution 2.5-10 mg every 2 hours as needed for pain - citalopram 20 mg daily - furosemide 20 mg daily as needed for shortness of breath or tachypnea - lorazepam 0.5-1 mg every 2 hours as needed for agitation .
