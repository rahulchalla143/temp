Saw his PCP (noted + Asterixis) last Tuesday ([**3-26**]) and was evaluated at BHW and admitted for hepatic encephalopathy.
Work up per wife was a [**Name (NI) 5283**] U/S showing "enlarged liver", elevated ammonia level and low platelets.
Over the weekend, wife noted increasing lethargy again with worsening MS and only 3 BM since Sat, while taking lactulose qid.
No prior H/O GIB, Cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, ascites.
Decreased PO intake [**1-10**] to poor MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] wife, increased use of NSAIDs last 2 weeks for back pain .
Cellulitis in his lower limb followed by staphylococcal septicemia and bilateral septic arthritis of the hip.
This has resulted in replacement as well as 2 revisions of his right hip, while his left hip also has accelerated osteoarthritis and may need replacement.
HTN 7.
He quit alcohol 20 years ago, and had an alcohol problem for approximately 3 years only.
Family History: Family Hx: Mother with HTN, CAD s/p CABG, NIDDM.
Father with CHF and NIDDM.
MM dry, with dried blood noted around gums and oral mucosa without any obvious lesions/source visualized.
Neck: supple, no JVD or LAD appreciated Pulmonary: CTA-B, no w/r/r/ Cardiac: RRR, s1 s2 normal, no m/g/r Abdomen: soft, very distended with shifting dullness to percussion.
+chronic venous stasis changes.
Fever - patient finishing 10 day course of levo/flagyl [**4-10**], but with new fever and leukocytosis.
Chest X-ray shows new white out of L lung and multiple alveolar opacities in R lung, suggesting multifocal, possibly aspiration pneumonia.
No evidence of free air on CXR.
Concern also for SBP given low AFTP 0.3 and recent EGD/colonoscopy.
Has R hip stage I decub ulcer, but no erythema or warmth surrounding lesion, so not suspicious for cellulitis - Bcx x 2 - UA and urine cx - paracentesis today p 2 units FFP for emergent INR reversal - increase abx coverage to vanc, ceftazidime, flagyl (in discussion with ID) for broad spectrum coverage.
Patient with anion gap metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
The patient was encephalopathic with abdominal distention suggesting ascites.
On [**4-1**], the patient had an ultrasound which showed a nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis, patent hepato-pedal flow within the portal vein, ascites, sludge within the gallbladder, and no stones.
The read initially stated that there may be intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and a MRCP was ordered given his rising direct hyperbilirubinemia.
However, he failed to remain still [**1-10**] to pain and agitation x 5 attempts.
An AFP was measured on the patient, and was found to be mildly elevated to 8.9 (nl up to 8.7), with negative peritoneal fluid cytologies.
His MELD score is 26, and he will need a workup for a possible liver transplant.
- Liver team aware - Hep serologies positive for recovery period of Hep B (HBsAg neg, HBsAB pos, HbcAB pos); past exposure to Hep A (HAV Ab positive, IgM negative) and positive HCV Ab with VL of 84,000 - Nadolol 20 mg QD for portal HTN and gastropathy - continue lactulose and rifaximin - continue protonix 40 Q12 for PPX .
New-onset ascites - This was felt to be from portal-hypertension [**1-10**] to decompensated liver disease.
No evidence of SBP on both taps [**4-1**] and [**4-3**].
[**4-6**] paracentesis unsuccessful.
Patient with new fever [**4-10**] and s/p EGD/colonoscopy with high risk of SBP - Diagnostic/therapeutic tap today.
2 units FFP prior to tap - continue aldactone 50 QD for ascites.
Had almost no ascites seen on U/S [**4-6**].
Encephalopathy - Patient admitted with likely hepatic encephalopathy.
Has had multiple BMs.
[**4-9**] EGD showed 3 cords grade I varices, portal gastropathy and colonoscopy showed diffuse continuous congestion with no bleeding consistent with nonspecific mucosal edema.
- s/p 2 units PRBCs [**4-6**] for decreased Hct since admission - hct now stable at 28.
- continue protonix [**Hospital1 **] - nadolol 20 QD for portal gastropathy - NPO for now given decreased mental status - active T&S, pt consented for tx .
Hyponatremia - Initially [**1-10**] hypervolemic hyponatremia from ascites.
Though patient may now be slightly hypovolemic given that he was mistakenly NPO most of yesterday, despite having orders for a diet.
NIDDM - exact dose of NPH unknown per wife, will cover with [**Name (NI) **] and add NPH depending on amount of [**Name (NI) **] needed - pt with minimal po now .
Chronic pain/h/o IVDU - on high-dose of methadone through clinic, followed at CAB (Pat-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 21450**]).
- increased methadone to 60 mg qd -> hold/decrease depending on MS, increase dose if signs of withdrawal.
- patient sinus tachy, BP stable, no other signs of withdrawal - watch for signs of withdrawal .
Tachycardia - patient with tachycardia throughout this admission.
Does have dry MM, blood crusted mouth, which suggest some amount of hypovolemia.
Patient also complaining of rib pain (has chronic pain issues), which may be causing tachycardia.
Also, may have some slight withdrawl from methadone.
*Prophylaxis: PPI IV bid, pneumoboots, lactulose *FEN: diabetic/low Na/low protein diet when patient awake and with supervision *Access: PICC line *Code Status: Full *Dispo: to ICU *Comm: HCP: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 21451**] (h) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21452**]; (c)[**Telephone/Fax (1) 21453**] - family made aware of transfer to ICU Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21454**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21455**] (beeper), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13553**] (office) - methadone program medical director MICU course:  A/P: 49 y/o male with PMHx of HepC cirrhosis, who intially presented with hepatic encephalopathy and was transferred to MICU for worsening mental status and possible aspiration PNA.
hypotension requring pressor, increased lactate and respiratory distress.
## Hypotension/Sepsis - o/n pt.
with hypotension and increased lactate.
likely w/ sepsis requring large amounts of fluid and pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
w/ known pneumonia - likely aspiration - this may be the source.
w/ recent paracentesis that did not show SBP.
## Respiratory Distress - Pt.
w/ new wheezing this a.m. w/ no evidence of fluid overload.
w/ increased work of breathing (accessory muscles in use w/ low sats )and decreased mentation.
for hypoxic respiratory failure - cont.
## Metabolic Acidosis - pt.
w/ increased lactate that will not be cleared easily [**1-10**] to liver failure .
## HepC/Alcohol Cirrhosis - Based on patient U/S and reversal of flow it appears that patient with progressively worsening liver failure.
Patient [**Name (NI) **] continue to rise and MELD > 26, and will need workup for possible liver transplant.
Recent paracentesis w/o SBP - Consider repeat paracentesis give septic picture - Will continue to follow with liver - Will continue lactulose and refaximin - Will continue nadolol, protonix, aldactone .
## Altered Mental Status - Was resoloving and was most likely encephalopathic from liver failure.
However, this is now exacerbated by septic picture - Will treat for infection - Will continue lactulose and refaximin as above .
## PNA - Chest xray suggests worsening opacities consitent with aspiration PNA.
Patient increased altered mental status or recent EGD may have caused patient to aspirate.
Will empiracally treat for nosocomial infection with vanc/ceftaz/flagyl.
## HTN - Patient currently on ACEI, nadolol, aldactone.
Will monitor BP closely, if BP drop will first d/c ACEI .
## Anemia - Patient Hct currently stable.
Most likely secondary to liver failure.
Patient with EGD and c-scope this admission which showed no active bleeding.
## History of drug use - Patient was getting methadone 60mg daily on floor to prevent withdrawal, however given new altered mental status will hold methadone for now.
Pt's SBP continued to drop, and failed to come up with fluid boluses.
The patient's status continued to deteriorate with bleeding from NGT, and increasing lactic acidosis on 3 pressors (lactate 10.4).
