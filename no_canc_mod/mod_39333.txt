He was unresponsive on presentation to the ICU but his friend [**Name (NI) **] said that he had been having frequent diarrhea since being on Abx for his toe and had also injured his ribs after walking into the couch and was complaining of sharp pain on inspiration x 4 days.

Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley Ext: cool, dopplerable pulses in R foot, L radial pulse>R radial pulse but R axillary puls 2+, slow capillary refill to fingers and toes.
Discharge Exam: General: on trach, eyes open and oriented to voice, responding to simple commands, lethargic HEENT: trach in place, no signs of active bleeding.
Sclera anicteric, dry MM Lungs: relatively clear, some bibasilar crackles CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2,  SEM  [**2-18**] Abdomen: Soft, non-distended, bowel sounds hypoactive, no signs of pain during palpation GU: Foley in place, significant scrotal edema improved Ext: s/p left BKA.
No intra-abdominal source of infection is identified.
Within the limits of a non-contrast study, the bowel and solid abdominal vessel appear normal.
Emphysema seen at the lung bases, with left basilar tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, which could reflect infection or aspiration.
Clinical correlation to exclude cellulitis is recommended.
Status post aortobifemoral graft.
Additional extensive atherosclerotic disease noted as above.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no entries in these files.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There was one entry in these files due to muscle artifact.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no entries in these files.
IMPRESSION: This video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton activations and no electrographic seizures.
Overall, the EEG is still consistent with a mild encephalopathy .
Surgical clips are seen overlying the spine at the level of the diaphragm   Brief Hospital Course: 67 yo M with IDDM presenting with hyperglycemia, acidosis, and hypotension after a prolonged diarrheal illness, intubated for hypoxia, who developed toxic metabolic encephalopathy .
Initially there was suspicion for aspiration PNA in the setting of being found down and bilateral patchy opacities on CXR.
He was extubated [**2153-3-30**] and reintubated a few hours later due to desaturation.
He was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime for healthcare acquired pneumonia and descalated to bactrim for stenotrophomonas and klebsiella isolated from sputum; however, those was discontinued 2 days thereafter because they were thought to be colonizers.
On HD13, CXR showed new RUL infiltrate and he as started on an 8 day course of Vancomycin and Cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia.
Throughout the remainder of hospital stay, he tolerated [**6-24**] hours off of the ventilator on tracheostomy mask; however, he would either desaturate or appear uncomfortable prompting resumption of ventilation.
We believe that he may have a component of neuromuscular weakening, for which he tires easily.
# Hypotension: On admission, the patient was hypotensive in the setting of a recent diarrheal illness and hyperglycemia, suggesting hypovolemia.
After tracheostomy he had three episodes of hypoxia while on the trach collar, followed by non-responsivness and hypotension.
There was no evidence to support an underlying infection or sepsis physiology.
A random cortisol was drawn and appropriately elevated, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
# Encephalopathy: While intubated the patient had periods of non-responsiveness and staring spells concerning for seizure.
Neurology was consulted and 48 hour EEG showed encephalopathy without epileptiform activity.
Repeat 24 hour continuous EEG confirmed no seizure activity and MRI head was declined by [**Hospital 228**] Health Care Proxy.
[**Name (NI) **] had waxing and waining mental status in the setting of the above hypotensive/hypoxic events.
His encephalopathy is likely multifactorial in nature, relating to hypotension and toxic metabolic insult from DKA, hypercarbia, acidosis, and renal failure.
His mental status improved, but he continues to be intermittently confused as well as lethargic.
# Acute Kidney injury: Creatinine rose during admission to 5.1 thought to be secondary to ATN from hypotension and rhabdomyolysis.
Renal ultrasound was negative for hydronephrosis or stones.
Gradually the patient's creatinine trended down, and continued to trend down with diuresis with a Lasix gtt.
# Anemia: Patient's hematocrit gradually trended down after admission 27->21.
Stool was GUAIAC positive suggesting possible GI source.
# Wounds: Patient has several wounds secondary to pressure and longstanding diabetes mellitus, including a 10X7 cm unstagable sacral decubitus ulcer with small area of black eschar (present on admission) and multiple ulcers on his distal extremities for which Wound Care was consulted and provided recommendations regarding positioning and daily dressings.
His pain was controlled with IV morphine.
Likely secondary to medications or infection.
# Hyperglycemia: Presented with diabetic ketoacidosis.
He had episodes of hypoglycemia in the setting of holding his tube feeds prior to the OR for tracheostomy.
The likely inciting event was diarrhea and dehydration.
Then non-gap acidosis may be a combination of his diarrhea and volume resuscitation with NS.
# Demand ischemia: After admission, troponins trended up from 0.11 to a peak of  0.33, CKMB followed a smililar pattern.
Likely secondary to demand ischemia given hypotension and prolonged down period, no evidence of acute coronary thrombosis on EKG.
He was given nutrition via nasogastric tube however patient pulled the tube many times due to encephalopathy.
