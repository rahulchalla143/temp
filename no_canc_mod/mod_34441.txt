Admission Date:  [**2132-3-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-3-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-6-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Amoxicillin / vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2927**] Chief Complaint: Transferred from [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital following breakthrough seizures  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 47 y/o man with history of HTN, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder s/p TBI, behavioral changes (mostly aggression) following TBI, and ESRD of unknown etiology s/p recent renal transplant who was at [**Hospital1 **] Rehab facility following his transplant surgery ([**2132-2-3**]).
He had no seizures during this hospitalization, and during his rehab stint was doing well and he was about to be discharged back to his group home.
On the afternoon of [**2132-3-9**], he was found unresponsive in his room to verbal and tactile stimulation.
He was noted to have right gaze deviation, and was tachycardic and diaphoretic.
He quickly returned to his baseline neurologic status.
We don't have an examination from that visit, but he received a CXR (negative for infiltrative process) as well as NCHCT which showed expected posttraumatic changes and encephalomalacia following his known traumatic brain injury.
Today he was found on the floor with a head laceration over his right brow.
The thought was that he had an unwitnessed seizure and therefore was given 2mg IV ativan and taken to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital.
On ROS: he denies headache, changes to vision, fever or chills, nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, extremity pain, and no rashes.
He does state that his nose hurts and that his tongue hurts.
With regards to his past sz/neurologic history: The patient sustained head injury in [**2122**].
He has 2 types of seizures- generalized tonic clonic, and partial complex characterized by speech arrest, staring, following by yell, with L arm elevation and head turn to R, followed by 1-2 minutes of confusion.
In [**2128-2-3**], he had an increase in seizure frequency, from 0 to 3 seizures per month, attributed to worsening renal failure and needing to start on HD.
He lives in a group home for the past several years because his behavior became difficult to control after the head injury (aggression).
Past Medical History: - ESRD of unclear etiology, on HD for several years, now s/p transplant - penetrating head trauma with metal blade [**2122**], s/p L frontal injury - Epilepsy secondary to TBI - HTN - hypothyroid   Social History: He has lived in a group home (Neuro Restorative [**Telephone/Fax (1) 78359**]for the past 2 years.
Family History: His father had arthritis and died of an MI at age 60.
His mother has hypertension, breast cancer, and a tumor in her back.
Old skull trauma evident (frontal) Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.
Horizontal endgaze physiologic nystagmus.
No pronator drift bilaterally.
-Coordination: No intention tremor, no dysdiadochokinesia noted.
No dysmetria on FNF bilaterally.
Atelectasis at the left lung base but no evidence of pneumonia.
No pulmonary edema.
Given his recent breakthrough seizures while on depakote and zonegran and his history of being well controlled on keppra, he received a 750mg IV keppra IV load (his renal function is poor, with a creatinine that is currently a 3.2/3.3) and was started on keppra 750mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was initially admitted to the Neurology floor, but later in the ED, he was noted to have another GTC lasting 3 minutes (description is not available) and was given ativan out of concern for ongoing subclinical seizures.
Labs at the time of ICU admission showed a stable macrocytic anemia, uremia (BUN 43, Cr 3.3), normal LFTs and ammonia, normal UA and a normal VPA level (63), normal tox panels and a prominent lack of leukocytosis.
Overnight in the ICU, he remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
He was breathing in a nonlabored fashion and oxygenating well without tachypnea.
I spoke personally with the radiologist at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital who reviewed his NCHCT once again and did not find any evidence for a contusion or small hemorrhage following his "being found down".
We also discussed the possibility of checking MRI C-spine, but OSH notes report that his C-spine had been cleared while he was awake and able to deny tenderness and display a normal ROM.
We repeated a CXR which showed no infiltrate or effusion.
Given his overall hemodynamic and neurologic stability, he was transferred to the floor under the care of Epilepsy Attending, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] and team.
He will likely no longer require hemodialysis, but if he does he can take an extra 250 mg of Keppra after each round.
He had no further seizures.
Disp:*270 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2* 9. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or temp >100.4.
Disp:*15 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2* 13. levetiracetam 750 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day: for seizure prevention.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Seizures Secondary Diagnosis: Posttraumatic epilepsy, Posttraumatic behavioral changes, Hypertension, Renal failure s/p transplant, Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Through a series of physical examinations, neuroimaging studies and laboratory tests, we were able to determine that the likely reason for these seizures was the fact that one of your seizure medications (valproic acid or depakote) was recently reduced in dose.
We were able to rule out the presence of any new brain hemorrhage, infection or other metabolic abnormality.
Please continue to take ZONEGRAN/zonisamide at the prior prescribed dose for seizure prevention.
