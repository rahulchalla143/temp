Admission Date:  [**2170-10-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-11-2**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Coumadin / Xanax / Morphine  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: Lower extremity edema  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.
History of Present Illness: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with h/o CAD, CHF (EF of 25-30% per report in [**2168**]), who presents with a 2 week history of worsening lower extremity edema.
At this time, the patient developed progressive lower extremity edema, DOE, and fatigue, and presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**9-7**].
Two weeks later, the patient again presented to OSH with a similar presentation and was again diuresed and returned home.
The patient also denies dietary indiscretion, but does admit to eating quite a lot of soup at home.
On review of systems, the patient denies he denies any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain, chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with h/o CAD, CHF (EF 20%), and multiple admissions recently for lower extremity edema, who presents with a 2-week history of lower extremity edema.
On physical exam, the patient has 4+ pitting edema up to his hips bilaterally, scrotal edema, and elevated JVP.
The patient is most likely having a CHF exacerbation secondary to likely dietary indiscretion v. worsening cardiac function s/p MI v. medication non-compliance.
It appears that patient's acute on chronic renal failure is most likely a pre-renal etiology in the setting of CHF and poor forward flow v. obstruction v. ATN/AIN.
- Lasix 60 mg IV now and continue with plan for CHF as outlined above  - Send urine Na, Cr, and Urea in light of diuretic use to calculate FeUrea  - Continue to trend Cr and UOP .
He is not currently having any symptoms of chest pain.
Cardiac enzymes were elevated in the ED, though they appear to be at his baseline (0.10) and the patient does not have any significant ECG changes on admission.
The patient's troponins are most likely elevated in the setting of acute renal failure.

Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a h/o CHF, with an EF of 20%.
He also had an ECHO performed, which did not show any evidence of interval change from his prior ECHO in [**2170-6-22**].
The patient became very hypotensive with SBP to the 70s with this intervention, and he developed altered mental status.
The patient's lower extremity edema had decreased on this admission, and he was set up with a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].
It was thought that patient's acute on chronic renal failure was most likely a pre-renal etiology in the setting of CHF and poor forward flow.
The patient's Cr, however, increased again in the setting of more aggressive diuresis but was decreasing at the time of discharge.
He was not having any symptoms of chest pain at the time of admission.
Cardiac enzymes were elevated in the ED, though they appeared to be at his baseline (0.10) and the patient did not have any significant ECG changes on admission.
The patient's troponins were most likely elevated in the setting of acute renal failure.
He did not have any acute events during this admission.
