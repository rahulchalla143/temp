Admission Date:  [**2115-6-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2115-7-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2049-8-17**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26965**] is a 65 year-old male with end stage renal disease and peripheral vascular disease admitted on [**6-11**] originally to the Vascular Service for elective left below the knee amputation due to nonhealing ulcers.
Mr. [**Known lastname 26965**] has a history of multiple vascular interventions on his left leg including femoral distal bypass in [**2114-4-8**], but has a chronic pain and a nonhealing ulcer on his left foot, which has failed conservative therapy.
With the exception of his pain Mr. [**Known lastname 26965**] felt well on admission.
He denies fevers or chills, chest pain, shortness of breath.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for end stage renal disease secondary to ANCA vasculitis.
The patient was hemodialysis since [**2112**].
The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes since [**2093**].
The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease as noted above including previously mentioned left leg interventions as well as amputation of fifth metatarsals on his right foot.
The patient has a history of congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in [**2115-3-8**] showing a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 to 45%, right ventricular dilatation and mild pulmonary hypertension, as well as mild global right ventricular hypokinesis.
The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion.
The patient has a history of hyperthyroidism, hypertension, history of previous cerebrovascular accident, history of throat cancer status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy, history of MRSA bacteremia, history of GERD.
History of chronic aspiration pneumonias status post PEG placement.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Hydralazine to which he developed a vasculitis.
Cipro to which he gets swelling, ace inhibitors to which he gets swelling and Vancomycin to which the patient gets hives.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile with a temperature of 98.8, pulse 74, blood pressure 136/62, sating 94% on 2 liters O2.
Generally, he was cachectic ill appearing male in no acute distress.
He had no JVD, but his lungs were remarkable for bibasilar rales.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.
Chronic venostasis changes.
Right lower extremity had no edema and also had evidence of chronic venous changes.
IMPRESSION:  In short, this was a 65 year-old male with end stage renal disease and peripheral vascular disease and a myriad of other medical problems that was admitted for elective left below the knee amputation secondary to nonhealing ulcer.
Vascular:  The patient underwent left below the knee amputation as planned on [**6-12**] and was doing well postoperatively until [**6-16**] when he began having mental status changes.
Workup of the mental statue changes is discussed in the endocrine section below.
The patient's wound did not heal well and became necrotic, gangrenous and thus the patient was taken back to have his below the knee amputation revised to an above the knee amputation on [**2115-6-26**].
Postoperatively the patient's wound healed well and at the time of discharge was clean, dry and intact with no erythema and no exudate.
Endocrine:  The patient is a known type 2 diabetic who was taking Micronase at home that was discontinued on admission, because the patient was NPO for surgery.
Infectious disease:  The patient was afebrile throughout the course of his hospital stay until [**6-26**] when he spiked a temperature.
The patient underwent a TTE to rule out endocarditis, which showed no vegetations.
He also had another positive MRSA blood culture on [**7-2**] after the placement of a PICC line.
The patient remained afebrile with negative blood cultures from MRSA for the remainder of his hospital stay and was sent home for an add two weeks of Synercid.
Cardiac:  The patient had a history of atrial fibrillation, but was in normal sinus rhythm on admission.
Throughout the course of his stay he had episodic atrial fibrillation, but remained hemodynamically stable.
Sacral decubitus ulcer:  During the course of his hospital stay due to his prolonged immobilization postoperative and while being in the Intensive Care Unit the patient developed severe sacral decubitus ulcer stage 3 to 4, which required multiple debridement by plastic surgery while he was in house.
Because the patient's peripheral vascular disease it was thought that the patient is probably not a good candidate for flap reconstruction.
The patient was referred to general surgeon Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for follow up and further debridement of this wound as an outpatient and continued on wet to dry dressings three times a day.
Pulmonary:  The patient had a history of chronic aspiration pneumonias and had difficulty being weaned from oxygen as an inpatient.
Thus he was treated with a short course of Levofloxacin while in house even though his chest x-ray remained clear without signs of pneumonia during the course of his stay.
The patient was also continued on his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease inhalers and oxygen prn.
He was C-diff negative multiple times and it was thought that the diarrhea was secondary to antibiotic use.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was discharged home on [**2115-7-15**] in good condition to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] regarding treatment of his sacral ulcer, with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] regarding his atrial fibrillation and cardiac issues, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26966**] his primary care attending regarding his general care and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] for issues surrounding his hemodialysis.
Peripheral vascular disease status post left below the knee amputation revised to above the knee amputation.
End stage renal disease.
Sacral decubitus ulcer status post debridement times two.
B fragilis bacteremia.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
