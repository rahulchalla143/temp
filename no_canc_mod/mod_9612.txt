She was found to have severe mitral regurgitation, and had a mitral valve repair in [**2099-7-21**].
Postoperatively, she developed atrial fibrillation and was managed with amiodarone for about a year.
She has been plagued by episodes of congestive heart failure since her surgery, the first of which was in [**2099-7-21**], which required admission to her local hospital.
She currently finds that she gets dyspnea with walking up an incline or with any type of exertion.
Echocardiograms performed recently had revealed mitral stenosis, and she is now referred for a mitral valve replacement.
She denies having any anginal symptoms, but does report occasional heaviness in her chest when she is short of breath.
She denies any claudication, orthopnea, edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or lightheadedness.
