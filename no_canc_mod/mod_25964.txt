Minor soft plaques are seen in the cervical carotid vessels without evidence of a flow-limiting stenosis.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdense right MCA sign and a large right MCA territory infarct involving the right frontal, temporal and parietal lobes without hemorrhagic transformation.

There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale identified by color Doppler study or agitated saline contrast study (at rest x 2) in suboptimal views (cannot definitively exclude).
TEE [**2118-6-16**] No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence for cardiac source of embolus identified.
No ASD or PFO by color, 2D, or saline contrast injection.
Sinus bradycardia with sinus arrhythmia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Sinus rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-6-14**] the rate is increased and no longer bradycardic.
There are no other diagnostic differences.
53 yo RHM with history EtOH abuse, depression and hypertension presents with L hemiparesis and slurred speech.
He was out of the window for tPA or intervention based on the time last seen well and the CT findings.
NEURO: # Right MCA stroke: The patient was somnolent on presensation and during examination developed bradycardia to 40s and hypertension over 200s.
Head CT did show increased edema in the R MCA territory with mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle but no significant midline shift or downward herniation.
A repeat head CT the following morning showed no significant worsening, and his clinical exam had begun to improve.
He had a persistent dense left hemiparesis.
Cardiac telemetry showed intermittent bradycardia but no atrial fibrillation.
TEE showed minimal plaque in the descending aorta, no intracardiac source of thrombus and no ASD/PFO.
It was hypothesized that volume depletion in the setting of recent heavy EtOH intake could have caused the stroke.
He complainted of burning pain in his leg and right foot and was started on gabapentin.
Mild anisocoria with Left 5mm +, right 4.mm + in dim light.
Repeat CT scan was without evidence of herniation.
There was a flicker of movement in the proximal left leg ([**12-22**]), no movement of the left arm.
# Headache: Patient complainted of headache since admission.
# Leg pain: The patient complained of burning pain in his legs and was started on gabapentin for neuropathic pain.
Symptoms are possibly due to alcoholic neuropathy (b12 and folate were within normal limits) and possibly related to his stroke.
#PSYCH: Patient has depression and ETOH abuse.
He did express a persistent ideation that his wife strangled him, causing the stroke, but there was no evidence of trauma.
He had no suicidal or homicidal thoughts.
During this hospitalization, the patient exhibited signs of ethanol withdrawal including formication hallucinations.
These have resolved and the patient is no longer requiring benzodiazepine coverage.
Apparently he tells others he has reunited with his children, but when they were contact[**Name (NI) **] by his ex-wife [**Name (NI) 89242**] regarding this hospitaliztion, they reported that they have not seen him in 20 years.
It is unclear how much confabulation has been going on prior to the patient's stroke, but certainly he will require psychiatric evaluation once the acute phase of his neurologic rehabilation is completed.
Patient has complaints of chest pain associated with anxiety.
There episodes were were without changes on ECG.
We continued mirtazapine for anti-depressant and patient continued to volunteer symptoms of depression.
Cardiac: Patient has complaints of chest pain associated with anxiety.
There episodes were were without changes on ECG and other cardiac workup including echo were unremarkable with no source of cardiac cause of stroke.
His TSH on admission was significantly suppressed (TSH 0.040) however in discussion with Endocrine, this was felt to be of limited significance given his acute illness.
Patient noted visual hallucinations of insects crawling and was anxious and agitated [**Doctor Last Name **] high on CIWA scale.
She was treated with lorazepam PRN and had no withdrawal symptoms on discharge.
Transitional issues: Patient awaits further hypercoagulable work-up regarding the etiology of his stroke to include Factor V Leiden, fibrinogen and consideration of CT-chest/abdomen/pelvis.
11. polyvinyl alcohol-povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**12-19**] Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.
14. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Acute right middle cerebral artery stroke .
Secondary diagnoses: Alcohol withdrawal Left hemi-sensory neuropathic pain post stroke Headache likely multifactorial in etiology Mood disorder   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent but occasionally will be mildly disoriented.
Patient has a long history of psychiatric issues.
You presented with left sided weakness and slurred speech and were found to have a stroke on the right side of the brain on CT and MRI scan which was responsible for this.
You had some swelling in the head and you were observed in the ICU.
You were transferred to the neurology [**Hospital1 **] but still had significant left sided weakness.
You had swallowing problems due to your stroke and were assessed by speech and swallow and you were started on a thick diet to help prevent choking and inhaling food.
You had episodes of chest pain associated with anxiety and headache which is likely partly due to your stroke but also has likely been aggravated by taking pain-killers during your hospitalization.
Nerve pain from your stroke was treated with a tablet called gabapentin.
Medication changes: We STARTED heparin to prevent blood clots we STARTED folic acid 1mg daily We STARTED multivitamins We STARTED thiamine 100mg daily We STARTED famotidine 20mg twice daily for increased stomach acid We STARTED aspirin 325mg daily to reduce risk of further stroke We STARTED a nicotine patch We STARTED acetaminophen as required for headache although this should be used sparingly We STARTED simvsatatin 20mg daily to help lower cholesterol and hence risk of stroke We STARTED ibuprofen 400mg as required for pain We STARTED gabapentin 200mg three times daily for arm and leg pain from your stroke We continued your Trileptal (oxcarbazapine), sodium valproate and mirtazapine   Followup Instructions: We made the following neurology appointment for you:  Department: NEUROLOGY When: MONDAY [**2118-8-8**] at 3:30 PM With: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 640**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3445**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2574**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 858**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage
