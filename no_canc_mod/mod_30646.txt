Arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] around 8 a.m., where he was post-ictal, with no response to voice but withdrawal to noxious stimuli.
There was less movement of the right side than left, and upgoing toes bilaterally.
His last seizure was in [**2155-2-18**], and may actually have been syncope with 30 seconds of convulsive activity afterwards.
Seizures thought likely related to chronic microvascular disease.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hx old left pontine lacunar infarct, no residual weakness Alcohol abuse Dementia (?Korsakoff) - Lives in nursing home but apparently fairly high functioning at baseline Chronic Renal insufficiency Anemia of Chronic Disease Gout Depression Actinic Keratoses  Social History: lives with wife at [**Hospital3 2558**].

No speech or vocalization.
When stimulated and lifts left arm or leg has high amplitude tremor, which is suppressible, and is elicited by movement.

These periods were accompanied by left arm shaking while his head was turned to the left.
ABNORMALITY #2: A poorly developed background with 6 Hz slowing was observed throughout the recording, with decreased amplitude over the left hemisphere.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the poorly developed background activity with decreased amplitude over the left hemisphere.
The decreased amplitude may suggest a diffuse left subcortical dysfunction or an intervening tissue (such as a subdural hemorrhage).
The episodes of left upper extremity shaking with associated left hemisphere 4 Hz rhythmic slowing likely represents movement artifact, as the patient's head was positioned with the left side against the bed.
There was no evolution to the rhythmic slowing and no epileptiform discharges were noted.
EKG: Sinus bradycardia First degree AV block Inferior ST-T changes are nonspecific   Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 64 0 90 426/435 0 12 9    Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old man with history of alcohol withdrawal seizures and one possible seizure not in setting of withdrawal, now with over two hours of forced left gaze and head deviation, and right sided weakness.
No recent illness, but had a dental procedure on Friday for extraction of tooth.
No evidence of new infarct, bleed, or mass on head CT to explain the gaze deviation, likely still seizing, right sided weakness could represent [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paresis versus another intracranial process (e.g.
infarct) that is not yet evident on CT. After extensive discussion with ED staff, and ED staff discussion with patient's family re: DNI status, decision was made not to give more benzos, although this would be the best acute treatment for his seizure as it is the quickest-acting.
There is however a significant risk of respiratory depression and he definitely did not want intubation nor does his family.
Movements stopped, but patient became very somnolent and minimally responsive.
Patient subsequently was afebrile throughout the hospital course.
