By report there was no report of any trauma or fall.
A head CT revealed a large Right occipital hemorrhage.
She was then seen by neurosurgery who recommended repeat NCHCT with EVD if worsening bleed, loading with Keppra and HTN goals <140.
Neurology is consulted for recs regarding BP goals and stroke workup.
Of note, at baseline, patient is oriented to person only and is wheelchair dependent.

S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Neurologic:  -Mental Status: Intubated, sedated, does not open eyes to voice or command, withdraws with pain in all limbs  -Cranial Nerves: I: Olfaction not tested.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
Enlarging right occipital and parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extension into the ventricle and extension into the subarachnoid space.
No shift of midline structures or herniation is evident.
A brain MRI is recommended to rule out underlying hemorrhagic tumor or infarction.
No actively bleeding vessel identified on the technically limited CTA.
Atherosclerotic disease involving the bilateral vertebral and cavernous carotid arteries.
Stable overall appearance of hemorrhage with some redistribution of blood products into the contralateral occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
No evidence of shift of midline structures or herniation.
Areas of unchanged hypodensity within the hemorrhage must be followed closely for stability, as extension of these regions would represent active bleeding/ adjacent edema.
Further workup for underlying cause as clinically indicated.
The left hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe combined with small effusion.
Repeat CT showed enlarging R occipital hemorrhage.
INR was reversed with 1u of FFP and 10mg of Vit K. Given her declining neurologic status and poor prognosis, a family meeting was held and the decision was made to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].
She was started on a morphine drip and hyoscyamine patch, and was then transitioned to a dilaudid drip along with prn ativan IV for respiratory distress.
