She denies any LOC, dizziness, vertigo, N/V, CP, palpitations or prodromal symptoms.
In the ED she had no focal neuro deficits, vital signs were t 98.1, HR 68, BP 166/140, RR 20 O2SAT 99%RA.
A head CT showed a right frontal SAH vs contusion.
Her spine had no fractures only degenerative changes.
A repeat CT on [**5-31**] showed no short interval change.
There is a small focus of intraparenchymal versus subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontoparietal region just to the right of midline.
Able to walk on heels and on tip-toes without difficulty.
No finger-to-nose dysmetria.
Pertinent Results: HCT 36.9, PLT 152, WBC 12.8, INR 1.2, CREAT 0.9, Na 137 LFTs normal, cardiac enzymes normal UA - no evidence of UTI  Echo [**2178-6-2**]: Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) MR.  CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2178-6-2**] 9:24 AM  CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  Reason: S/P FALL, CAROTID STENOSIS  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 78 year old woman with h/o falls with s/p new fall and subarachnoid versus intraparenchymal small bleed REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: carotid stenosis HISTORY: Fall with intracranial bleed.
FINDINGS: Minimal wall thickening involving the right carotid bulb only.
IMPRESSION: Widely patent common and internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2178-5-30**] 6:14 PM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: S/P FALL  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 78 year old woman with occipital laceration s/p fall REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for bleed CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Status post fall with occipital laceration.
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: Along the midline, within the superior portion of the head, there is a somewhat rounded hyperdense focus located just to the right of midline.
This lesion represents a small focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage versus intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
No additional foci of hemorrhage are detected.
There are hypodensities within the cerebral periventricular white matter, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
There are no extraaxial collections identified.
There is hematoma in the parietal portion of the scalp.
No fracture is identified.
The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
This focus represents either a small intraparenchymal hemorrhage versus subarachnoid hemorrhage.
3) Scalp hematoma.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) S/P fall:  From the history it was determined that the patient most likely had a mechanical fall with no evidence of a syncopal episode.
The patient had no focal neuro deficits at any time.
The patient did have some increase in her baseline memory deficit (worked up by neuropsych at the [**Hospital1 18**]) and some frontal release symptoms that were consistent with stress of being an inpatient and the location of the SAH, respectively.
She should have her outpatient neurologist review her CT scans to determine if follow-up head imaging is indicated to rule out a meningioma.

Please do not take any aspirin for at least 6 months, or until your neurologist tells you that it is okay to do so as you are at high risk for having recurrent bleeding in your brain if you take aspirin or any blood thinner.
