Admission Date:  [**2101-9-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-9-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18141**] Chief Complaint: fever and hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Insertion of peripherally inserted central catheter Revision of right nephrostomy tube  History of Present Illness: This is an 86 year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, recurrent urinary tract infections and urosepsis in the setting of bilateral obstructing nephrolithiasis, S/P right nephrostomy tube placement who presented from nursing home with fever and hypotension.
At baseline, she is non-verbal, G-tube dependent and unable to perform ADLs.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was previously admitted on [**5-10**] with urosepsis (E. coli & Strep milleri).
She had bilateral obstructing renal stones requiring percutaneous nephrostomy tube on the right and also found to have a uterosigmoid fistula.
She was treated with sepsis protocol, 1 week of steroids and 2 week antibiotic course.
The pt's daughter notes that about 4 days prior to admission, her urine color has changed and she has been looking around the room less.
After discussion with family regarding code status, she was started on the sepsis protocol, receiving 2L of NS, and started on piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and metronidazole as well as dopamine.
While in the MICU, patient was found to have mild right and moderate left hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound.
She subsequently went to interventional radiology, where right nephrostomy tube was changed, and no new left nephrostomy inserted due to resolution of left hydronephrosis.
Aspiration pneumonia 3.
Uterosigmoid fistula 5.
B/L obstructing renal stones s/p right nephrostomy tube 6.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: T 96.9 HR 100 BP 74/34 RR 20 O2 sat 99% on 100% NRB, on 10 mcg/kg/min dopamine Gen: somnolent, responds to painful stimuli, but otherwise not responding.
Neck: No LAD or thyromegly.
CV: regular and tachycardic with no m/r/g Lungs: Crackles at bases bilaterally.
Abd: soft, NT, ND active BS, no hepatosplenomegly, J tube in place, no drainage ext: warm and sweaty, with 2+ DP pulses, No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
neuro: increased tone in neck and arms with decreased tone in legs.
TTE [**2101-6-9**]:  Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (ejection fraction 30-40 percent) secondary to extensive apical akinesis.
A moderate sized thrombus is seen in the apex of the left ventricle.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Right-sided nephrostomy tube with decompression of the right collecting system, with only mild upper pole hydronephrosis seen.
New moderate-to-severe left-sided hydronephrosis.
Given patient's history of sepsis, this is concerning for an obstructing nephropathy.
Indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm, which may represent atelectasis and/or consolidation.
Persistent obstruction of the distal right ureter.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Basal inferior hypokinesis is present.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion with fibrin/thrombus on the surface of the heart.
Compared to prior study on [**2101-6-9**], the LV apical thrombus is no longer seen and the PA pressure is now normal.
CVC Catheter tip no growth .
Stool negative for C diff X 4 .
Labs at discharge:  WBC 11.4, Hgb 11.1, Hct 32.4, Plt 307 PT 19.5, PTT 51.1, INR 1.9 BMP remarkable for creatinine 0.6, BUN 16, glucose 112, bicarb 30, sodium 136 lactate returned to [**Location 213**] 1.1 on [**9-21**] cortisol stim test within normal limits while in ICU   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 87 year old female with a history of Alzheimer's and prior urosepsis who presented with sepsis from a urinary source once again and who is now status post right nephrostomy tube & on antibiotics.
# Sepsis: The patient's presentation was most consistent with urosepsis.
- Her white count has steadily decreased and she has been afebrile for several days.
A slight increase in her white blood cell count two days ago is likely related to blockage of nephrostomy tube (nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 67863**] in closed position and corrected this).
- As patient is afebrile, will not treat for yeast in the urine at this point.
# H/o DVTs and apical ventricular thrombus on last ECHO: The patient was on warfarin prior to admission but this was held temporarily due to high INR on admission.
It is likely that her hypernatremia is related to dehydration and resolved once her free water deficit was repleted.
# Uterosigmoid Fistula: The patient was previously evaluated by gyn/surgery and thought to be not a candidate for surgery.
# ARF: The patient's acute renal failure seems to have resolved with stabilization of blood pressure and resolution of sepsis.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
