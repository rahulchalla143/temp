He also had aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.8 cm2.
Cardiac catheterization  demonstrated 3-vessel coronary artery disease with 60% left anterior descending artery stenosis, 70-95% left circumflex artery stenosis, an occluded right coronary artery with poor left-to-right collaterals.
Intraoperatively Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was asked to evaluate the level of calcific anatomy, and confirmed Dr[**Doctor Last Name **] findings.
He went into rapid atrial fibrillation on POD#1 and dropped his systolic blood pressure into the 70's.
He did have post operative acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 2.0 and this was decreasing at the time of discharge.
He was started on Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and received 2 doses of 5 mg and INR went to 4.8.
The patient will be advised to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks and at that time discuss Corevalve options for aortic stenosis.
