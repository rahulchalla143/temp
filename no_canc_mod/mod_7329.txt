Admission Date:  [**2119-2-3**]     Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2071-6-5**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Transplant Surgery HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 47-year-old gentleman admitted to the surgical intensive care unit on [**2119-2-20**], with hepatic encephalopathy and hypoxia.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has hepatitis C related cirrhosis of longstanding since childhood.
He sustained a motor vehicle accident on [**2118-12-31**], which resulted in a right hemothorax sternal fracture and was complicated by acute decompensation of his hepatic function which required an admission to the [**Hospital1 69**] with hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice with a rise in his total bilirubin count from 3.9 to 5.7, and acute renal failure with a creatinine rise from 0.5 to 2.1.
He was discharged following this admission and readmitted on [**2119-2-3**], for persistent encephalopathy, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distention.
Subsequently, he vomited his tube feeds while on the floor and developed a cough followed by decreased mental status and hypoxia.
He was started on antibiotics for a presumed diagnosis of aspiration pneumonitis.
He was subsequently transferred the surgical intensive care unit again, on [**2-20**], for management of hypoxia and hepatic encephalopathy.
Physical examination and further workup suggested a possible aspiration pneumonitis involving the right upper and middle lobe.
On [**2-23**], he underwent left thoracocentesis with 1 liter of bloody fluid aspirated from the left pleural cavity.
At this stage, the patient had Child's C cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and hypoxia, possibly secondary to an aspiration pneumonitis.
Despite these measures, Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to remain very sick, and his renal function deteriorated as did his liver hepatic function, as well as transaminases.
On [**2-27**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] received an orthotopic liver transplant.
There was end-to-end anastomosis of the donor and recipient IVC.
End-to-end anastomosis of the donor and recipient portal vein.
End-to-end anastomosis of the donor and recipient hepatic artery.
There was also end-to-end anastomosis of the donor and recipient of the donor and recipient bile duct with T-tube insertion.
There were no complications during the procedure.
The right middle lobe and right lower lobe lavage with normal saline.
A pigtail catheter was also inserted under ultrasound guidance into the right chest to drain the right pleural effusion.
His fever was worked up with pan cultures, and he was started on acyclovir, and central lines were changed and tips sent for cultures.
As he continued to have thick purulent secretions from his lung which required very frequent suctioning, and this was preventing weaning from the ventilator, we decided to give him double coverage with antibiotics and add gentamicin to the meropenem that he was already on.
In view of his persistent depressed mental status, he underwent a head CT to rule out any intracranial infarct, and the head CT was negative for hemorrhage or infarct but possible Central Pontine Myelinolysis could not be ruled out.
On postoperative day 15, he had a low-grade temperature and some further adjustments were made to his antibiotic regimen.
In view of his prolonged intubation and ongoing aggressive pulmonary toilet needs, he underwent an percutaneous tracheostomy on postoperative day 16.
On postoperative day 17, bilateral lower extremity deep venous thromboses were noted, and he was anticoagulated with heparin infusion.
On postoperative day 18, he again had a temperature spike for which he was pan cultured, and he central venous line was changed.
He received further bronchoscopies at intervals of three to four days for pulmonary toilet for recurrent right lower lobe collapse.
Repeat bronchoalveolar fluid cultures grew Pseudomonas aerogenesis.
By the third week postoperatively, he had persistent pseudomonas tracheobronchitis, lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, and persistently elevated bilirubin and transaminases, which was felt to be secondary to sepsis-related cholestasis.
His mental status changes issues were revisited, and he underwent an MRI of his head which showed some high density signals in the pontine and extra pontine area, the significance of which was unclear.
He also developed some smelly stools, and Clostridium difficile cultures were sent off for the stools which came back negative.
This was felt to be the colonization of his biliary tree and was therefore not treated.
He was extremely weak physically with severe deconditioning resulting from his prolonged illness and intensive care unit stay.
The biopsy did not show any evidence of rejection.
A Doppler ultrasound of the liver done at the time also revealed patent vessels with good flow, and no evidence of biliary duct obstruction.
By postoperative day 29, that is on [**3-29**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was four weeks out from his orthotopic liver transplant with ongoing issues of pseudomonas, tracheobronchitis, and persistently elevated liver function tests which appeared to be secondary to sepsis-related cholestasis.
He also had lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
He had no cranial nerve deficits.
No focal neurological signs, and could move all four extremities.
From an infectious disease perspective, he had no further positive cultures from his blood, and he is currently on tobramycin nebulizer for his pseudomonas tracheobronchitis, and has not had any fevers for a while.
Also, he was being therapeutically anticoagulated with Coumadin to treat his deep venous thrombosis.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable with tracheostomy requiring less ventilator support but close monitoring and physical therapy.Patient is very deconditioned and weak but medically stable with excellent graft function and no evidence of rejection.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  A 47-year-old Caucasian male, status post orthotopic liver transplant for hepatitis C related cirrhosis with pseudomonas tracheobronchitis, lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, and persistently raised liver function tests secondary to sepsis-related cholestasis.
