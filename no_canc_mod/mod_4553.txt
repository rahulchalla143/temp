He was admitted to the [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2129-9-4**], for cellulitis and sepsis.
He had cut his left leg with a saw blade on [**2129-9-2**], and subsequently developed erythema of the leg.
On [**2129-9-4**], he awoke with fever, chills and rigors and went to [**Hospital3 4527**] where he was noted to have a temperature of 104 degrees and also appeared to be uncomfortable and short of breath.
The left leg cellulitis seemed to improve and the Neo-Synephrine was weaned off.
On [**2129-9-6**], the patient was noted to have increasing respiratory distress.
Chest x-ray showed evidence of pulmonary edema which was treated with Lasix.
There was some response initially but the respiratory distress was not relieved.
Morbid obesity.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus with increasing insulin requirement, diabetic neuropathy.
Chronic pain with possible opioid dependence.
Hypertension since age of 19.
Coronary artery disease.
Obstructive sleep apnea requiring CPAP for more than ten years.
Status post hydrocele repair which was complicated by postoperative cellulitis.
Status post left ankle surgery.
He smokes a pipe or cigar occasionally.
No history of ethanol or intravenous drug use.
Pulmonary - There was no wheeze.
Crackles at the bases.
Cardiac - regular heart sounds, S1 and S2, sounds distant, no murmur appreciated.
Extremities 3+ peripheral edema left leg, torso edematous with palpable pulses.
Skin - erythema left ankle above the cut.
Chest x-ray was of poor quality and diffuse alveolar infiltrate suggestive of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure.
could not rule out adult respiratory distress syndrome.
Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with normal axis, with no evidence of ischemia.
After the initial course of hemodynamic instability, there was a face of hypertension where the blood pressure was difficult to control requiring increasing the doses of the antihypertensive medications.
There was one episode of fast atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability which required cardioversion.
The oxygenation improved gradually and for the past two weeks, there has been no evidence of respiratory distress.
There was one episode of prerenal failure which improved spontaneously and he did not require dialysis or hemofiltration during his stay in the MICU.
Gastrointestinal - Due to the long-standing diabetes mellitus, he was prone for recurrent gastroparesis.
There was one episode of coffee ground vomitus but the patient had a stable hematocrit and therefore did not need an endoscopy.
Endocrine - Very large insulin requirements and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.
Infectious disease - Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive and positive blood cultures.
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive fungal cystitis.
He was Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive in sputum on [**2129-10-19**].
Musculoskeletal - Back pain which has gradually resolved and received physical therapy.
Nutrition - The patient required prolonged parenteral nutrition due to the gastroparesis but now he has a postpyloric tube and he is on enteral feeds.
He also had an ENT consultation in this regard and the cords are able to move but he is unable to phonates due to no leak around the tracheostomy tube.
The tracheostomy tube was not changed for fenestrated tube due to anatomical difficulty and relatively young tracheostomy tract.
