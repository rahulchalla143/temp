Admission Date: [**2129-10-21**]        Discharge Date: [**2129-11-4**]  Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 18719**] is an 89-year-old, Russian-speaking woman with known CAD (coronary artery disease) who presented to an outside hospital emergency room on [**10-19**] with congestive heart failure and hypertension.
She had elevated cardiac enzymes and troponins at that,  along with ST elevations by EKG ruled in for non- STEMI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization.
Catheterization done at [**Hospital1 **] MC showed three-vessel coronary artery disease and cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for possible CABG (coronary artery bypass graft).
As stated, the catheterization showed three-vessel disease, including 95 percent left main, 95 percent RCA (right coronary artery), 80 percent circumflex and 99 percent distal LAD (left anterior descending) with an EF (ejection fraction) of 40 percent.
The patient has no known drug allergies.
SKIN:  No lesions.
RESPIRATORY: No asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), positive CHF.
GI:  Nausea with angina.
No GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) or melena.
GU:  No dysuria or hematuria.
ENDOCRINE: No diabetes or thyroid disease.
HEME:  No anemia NEUROLOGICALLY: No seizures, CVA's (cerebrovascular), TIAs (transient ischemic attacks), syncope.
GENERAL:  Lying flat in bed, in no acute distress.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm, well-perfused with no to edema, no varicosities.
On postoperative day 2, the patient was transferred back to the cardiac surgery recovery unit, due to rapid atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate of 120 to 140.
On postoperative day 3, the patient developed a fever of 102.
Chest  x-ray was also done at that time that showed no infiltrates and the patient stayed in the ICU at that point for close pulmonary monitoring.
She remained in the ICU for vigorous pulmonary toilet, given her relative hypoxia.
By postoperative day 5, the patient's chest x-ray had shown improving lung fields and diaphragmatic excursion, and, at that time, she was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Over the next several days, the patient showed slow progress in her activity level.
She had no further of bouts of atrial fibrillation and, on postoperative day 9, it was decided that the following day the patient would be stable and ready to be discharged to rehabilitation.
Incision with staples and dry sterile dressing, no erythema or drainage.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm and well-perfused with no edema, bilateral leg incision from the saphenous vein harvest sites are clean and dry with Steri-Strips.
CAD (coronary artery disease) status post coronary artery    bypass grafting times 4, with LIMA (left internal mammary    artery) to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the LAD    (left anterior descending), saphenous vein graft to OM    (obtuse marginal) and saphenous vein graft to PDA    (posterior descending artery).
Benign positional vertigo.
Breast cancer status post lumpectomy.
Congestive heart failure.
