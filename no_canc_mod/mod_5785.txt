Mitral valve replacement with a 25/33 On-X Conform-X     mitral valve mechanical prosthesis.
Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting   History of Present Illness: 49 year-old female with type I diabetes complicated by ESRD s/p renal transplant x 2 with chronic rejection, s/p pancreatic transplant x 2, CAD s/p mulitple PCIs, severe MR complicated by severe heart failure admitted directly from Dr.[**Name (NI) 3536**] clinic due to [**Name (NI) 9140**] heart failure.
She previously been asymptomatic, but has progressed to NYHA class III with symptoms of lower extremity edema, orthopnea, and dyspnea on exertion.
Of note she had a stress test in [**2127-2-7**] which showed an inferior reversible defect.
Serial TTE's have revealed [**Year (4 digits) 9140**] mitral regurgitation (thought to be ischemic in nature).
At that time the [**Month/Year (2) 9140**] MR was noted, however cardiac catheterization was not completed as there was concern that the dye load from a cath would cause her to become dialysis dependent.
Due to her [**Month/Year (2) 9140**] heart failure symptoms she is being electively admitted for cardiac catheterization tomorrow.
Past Medical History: CAD Mitral Regurgitation - Diabetes - Dyslipidemia - Hypertension - NSTEMI in [**6-8**] treated with PDA stenting ([**6-8**]) - [**7-11**] DES x2 to RCA, c/b NSTEMI and left femoral pseudoaneurysm (treated conservatively) cath [**4-12**] with patent PDA and RCA stents.
40% proximal LAD and proximal RCA stenoses - Severe MR - Type I diabetes - ESRD [**3-10**] FSGS, s/p pancreas/kidney transplant x 2 ([**2112**], [**2-/2117**])   - Peripheral vascular disease (R fem-tib bypass ([**1-6**]) c/b right AV fistula aneurysm s/p repair ([**11-9**]) - Charcot joint, right foot  Past Surgical History: - s/p simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant in   the mid [**2107**] followed by a repeat pancreas transplant and then subsequently kidney re transplant in [**2117**] - s/p retinal detachment and enucleation of left eye - s/p D & C ([**3-10**]) - s/p Hysterectomy ([**4-9**]) - s/p TMJ surgery   Social History: Lives in [**Location 14078**], [**State 2748**] with mother.
Family History: No family Hx of CAD or DM.
MGM had HTN but lived to be 98.
PGF had renal disease.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinetic/aneurysmal basal inferior and basal inferoseptal walls.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There is a ridge of calcium/tissue in the ST junction, with a small mobile atheroma.
This point seems to be cause of increased transaortic velocity of 1.7 m/sec, The velocity at the aortic valve seems normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral central regurgitation is seen.
There is no prolapse or flail mitral leaflets.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild global RV systolic function.
There is a mechanical prosthesis in the mitral position with gradients consistent with the prosthesis and usual washing jets.
Transplant medicine followed for her history of pancreatic and renal transplants.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 6, the patient was ambulating, yet deconditioned, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
