Admission Date:  [**2185-8-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2185-8-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2141-5-11**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest and left shoulder pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44 year-old male with a history of smoking, family history of coronary artery disease who presents for cardiac catheterization.
The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital complaining of left shoulder pain radiating across his chest that lasted for approximately fifteen minutes and occurred two to three times a day.
He states he experiences the pain for the last couple of weeks.
He is noted to have continuous left shoulder pain that radiates to the chest that started approximately twelve hours since being seen in the Emergency Room.
In the Emergency Room he was treated with Lovenox, Morphine, nitroglycerin and Lopressor with continued 5 out of 10 pain and given sublingual nitroglycerin times three and morphine that gradually decreased his pain to 2 out of 10 and also noted to have asymptomatic runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia of approximately six beats.
Cardiac catheterization this morning revealed a right dominant system with subtotal occlusion of TIMI two flow after D2, 70% osteal D2 and a 3.5 by 28 stent was placed in the left anterior descending artery.
D2 was also dilated with a 2.5 mm balloon to normal flow and transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further management of his acute myocardial infarction.
Testicular cancer status post orchiectomy in [**2177**].
Gastritis status post gastrointestinal bleed in [**2154**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS:  He is no medications.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister is deceased at age 30 from cerebrovascular accident.
Mother is deceased from a myocardial infarction at age 55.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies any fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, melena, hematochezia.
Telemetry revealed twelve beat runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and asymptomatic.
His neck examination revealed no jugulovenous distention, supple with flat neck veins.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No guarding tenderness or rebound.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Electrocardiogram from the outside hospital revealed a rate of 70 normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, right atrial enlargement, ST elevations in V2 to V4 with poor R wave progression, Q waves in 2, 3, AVF and V1 through V3.
The left anterior descending coronary artery was successfully stented resulting in normal flow with no dissection and no residual stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 70% in the D2.
An echocardiogram performed after cardiac catheterization revealed moderately dilated left ventricular with severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderately depressed overall left ventricular systolic function and anterior apical and septal akinesis, as well as mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
On hospital day number two the patient started experiencing asymptomatic episodes of ventricular bigeminy, which continued throughout his course even with increasing his beta blocker.
Based on his echocardiogram Coumadin was started for anticoagulation to prevent thrombus formation.
Electrophysiology was also consulted in regard to his depressed ejection fraction as well as ventricular bigeminy.
He will also have outpatient T wave alternans study as well as a 24 hour Holter monitor to further evaluate risk for sudden cardiac death secondary to ventricular arrhythmias.
He will also have a scheduled T wave alternans test on Thursday [**9-15**] at 1:15 p.m. as well as meeting in the Holter laboratory on [**9-6**] at 11:00 a.m.
Acute myocardial infarction requiring anticoagulation.
