He reports he woke up with left arm pain which resolved with 1/2 tab of nitro after three minutes.
He had similar left arm pain an hour later which went away again with full tab of nitro this time and has not recurred since.
He went to his PCP where he was noted to have elevated cardiac biomarkers and thus sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Upon cardiac catheterization he was found to have left main disease and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.
