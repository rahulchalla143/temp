* ANEMIA/TRANSFUSION REACTION: Large number of anti-red cell antibodies identified during this hospitalization [**2-14**] past history of transfusions.
During initial hospitalization, patient was transfused one unit of PRBCs and developed acute stridor within one hour of initiation of transfusion.
This prompted overnight transfer to MICU for closer observation, but patient had no further respiratory distress and did well following.
Transfusion reaction investigation revealed new anti red cell antibodies, but no IgE suggestive of an etiology for reaction.
As such, it was felt by transfusion medicine consultants that patient may have had allergic reaction to penicillin contaminant in donor blood.
* RIGHT KNEE INFECTED HARDWARE - MSSA, with bacteremic spread as 3/4 bottles (+) for gram positive cocci in clusters.
Indeed, as noted below patient was a poor candidate for post-op anticoagulation given multiple red cell antibodies, anaphylactoid reaction, and history of massive GI bleed.
Given issues with red cell antibodies, it was felt that patient would require fully staffed blood bank during surgery, and trip to OR was coordinated with blood bank staff as this would likely occur on a Saturday morning.
However, given OR schedule and multiple traumas the night before patient's scheduled surgery, patient did not go to OR until Saturday evening, and staffing of blood bank was unclear at this point.
On [**2135-12-4**] she was taken to the or and underwent a radical arthroplasy rt infected total knee peplacement with removal of all hardware and complete synovectomy dedbridement  excision of sinus fistulous tract and insertion of abx spacer.
At this point, patient had been started on phenylephrine for hypotension by anesthesia intraop.
Indeed, it was felt that patient was most likely losing large amounts of blood through surgical site and orthopedics was called to evaluate the knee for post op bleeding.
The dressing was not overly saturated and the hemovac did not have  great deal of drainage, but because the INR was 3.1, it was felt by orthopedics PA that because of the extensive surgery there would be some bleeding and that this amt was not excessive.
Further complicating volume replacement was the fact that the cell washer in the blood bank on the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] had malfunctioned, with minimal blood bank staff in the early AM.
Patient was given blood products as needed but developed DIC [**2-14**] extensive bleeding.
Patient was seen by the transfusion service, but patient had begun to develop acidemia secondary to poor perfusion.
The patient expired shortly thereafter, and the family was notified  Medications on Admission: ADVAIR DISKUS 100-50MCG--One puff twice a day ARANESP 60MCG/.3ML--One injection sc per week, ordered by renal CALCIUM CARBONATE 500MG--One tablet by mouth twice a day FOLACIN-K 1MG--Ordered by another md K CL-40 40MEQ/15ML--40meq a day, ordered by other md LASIX 80MG--Ordered by another md LEVOXYL 50MCG--One tablet by mouth every day PROTONIX 40MG--One tablet by mouth every day VITAMIN D 400 UNIT--One tablet by mouth every day CALCITRIOL 0.25 mcg--1 capsule(s) by mouth 3x/week (mon, wed, fri) Sodium Citrate-Citric Acid 500-334 mg/5 mL--30ml solution(s) by mouth three times a day   Discharge Medications: n/a  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Lumbar Stenosis Anemia secondary to anti-red cell antibodies Anaphylaxis Renal Failure Metabolic Acidosis Sepsis Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Septic knee hardware/arthritis s/p rt knee arthroplasy  removal of all hardware insertion of abx spacer  Discharge Condition: expired  Discharge Instructions: n/a  Followup Instructions: n/a                               [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] MD [**MD Number(2) 617**]
