The patient states that the pain began approximately 20 to 30 minutes after he was mowing his lawn and began at rest.
Initial ECG at the outside hospital demonstrated ST segment elevations of 1 0.5 to 1 mm in 3 and aVF as well as Q-waves in 2, 3, and aVF.
The patient was initiated on a nitroglycerin drip, became hypotensive, and telemetry at that time showed a reperfusion rhythm of accelerated junctional rhythm with retrograde P-waves.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hyperlipidemia and rheumatoid arthritis.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
The patient has been taking prednisone for approximately 6 weeks for recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis as well as p.r.n.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father had an MI at age 83.
There are no sores or lesions in the oropharynx.
He has no JVD.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremities:  He has no peripheral edema.
No calf tenderness and has 2 plus DP and PT pulses bilaterally.
There is no femoral or carotid bruit.
Q-waves in 2, 3, and aVF as well as 0.5 mm ST segment elevations in 2, 3, and aVF.
Catheterization revealed 1-vessel coronary artery disease including a mid LAD total occlusion with faint TIMI 1 distal flow in the left-to-left collaterals.
He underwent PTCA/stenting of the mid LAD lesion with a Taxus drug-eluting stent.
Final angiography demonstrated no dissection and TIMI 3 flow.
Ventriculography demonstrated a calculated EF of 51 percent with anterior apical hypokinesis.
Echocardiogram also on the [**2164-7-9**] demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50 to 55 percent with an apical left ventricular aneurysm as well as anterior apical akinesis, septal apex akinesis, inferior apex akinesis and apical akinesis.
Right ventricular wall motion and chamber size were normal.
There was no significant mitral regurgitation.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
His joint pain was managed with Tylenol.
He will follow up with his primary care physician and with his rheumatologist for further management of his rheumatoid arthritis and for tapering off his prednisone.
Coronary artery disease.
Inferior myocardial infarction.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
