She had chest pressure intermittently with exertion for several weeks prior, worsening in the 4 days prior to admission with shortness of breath as well.
Day of admission, had chest pain at rest with shortness of breath so presented to LGH ER.
She has no chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea or other complaints.

S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
-diabetes with peripheral neuropathy and nephropathy -atrial arrythmia on coumadin -pneumonia in the past -temporal arteritis -s/p CCY -dCHF with EF 60% in [**2100**]  Social History: -Tobacco history:  denies -ETOH:  denies -Illicit drugs: denies  Family History: No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: + stasis dermatitis LLE, no ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
The Lcx had minor luminal irregularities with a patent stent.
The RCA was not engaged and known to have a 70% stenosis from prior angiography.
Successful PCI of proximal LAD with two overlapping BMS.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo F with h/o HTN, CAD s/p Lcx stent [**2093**] after MI, CKD baseline Cr 2.4 presented initially to [**Hospital6 3105**] on [**1-6**] with chest pain, s/p cardiac arrest and asystole resucitated after CPR and atropine.
Shortly after (8-9am) she was noted to have hemiparesis and an upgoing toe, likely secondary to a new stroke.
She was being anticoagulated throughout the event, so thrombotic stroke was less likely, and it was thought to possibly be due to watershed infarct in the setting of the severe hypotension.
# CORONARIES:  At OSH, LAD occlusion of 99% was noted and she was transferred here for intervention.
Cardiac enzymes were trending down on arrival and patient had no complaints of chest pain, shortness of breaht, or anginal type sx.
# PUMP:  Pt has h/o diastolic CHF with EF 60% per OSH records, and was on lasix at home.
On [**1-8**], f/u TTE was done at [**Hospital3 **] that showed decreased EF to 30% and anteroapical hypokinesis.
On initial exam, she had lower ext edema and decreased breath sounds at bases.
ACE or [**Last Name (un) **] was considered to optimize CHF regimen, but pt with [**Last Name (un) **] and discussion with PCP revealed that [**Name9 (PRE) **] had been tried in the past but was stopped because of hyperkalemia.
# RHYTHM:  Has a h/o afib on coumadin at home, with rate control with metoprolol 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Recommended TEE cardioversion and starting amiodarone, baseilne TSH nl and AST/ALT slightly elevated but trending downwards.
Coumadin had been held at OSH and was restarted along wtih a heparin gtt, for her high risk of clot in the setting of afib with apical wall motion anormality.
Likely [**2-28**] diuresis at OSH, and also had two caths in one day.
