The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
There is abnormal septal motion present, likely due to a combination of conduction abnormality and pressure/volume overload.
Normally functioning aortic prosthesis, normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function.
No tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Dysfunction of the right ventricle may have been masked by the degree of tricuspid regurgitation on prior.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 80287**] was admitted on [**2123-4-4**] for a heparin bridge before extraction of his RV lead and tricuspid valve replacement.
A perctoral hematoma formed which resolved with evaculation and a pressure dressing.
