Imaging:   CT head on admission: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Acute infarct involving the left striatum, with other punctate foci of involvement in the left centrum semiovale and possibly left superior temporal gyrus.
However, on the MRA of the neck images, there is no evidence of enhancement of the left middle cerebral artery.
Occlusion of the left internal carotid artery from the carotid bulb extending intracranially, although there may be some residual flow within the distal cavernous and supraclinoid segments.
Near-complete occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, with propagation since the earlier study and further diminished flow in the cavernous and supraclinoid segments.
There is also complete occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, with no evidence of flow-related enhancement throughout its visualized extent.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No significant right ICA stenosis.
Moderate to high-grade left external carotid artery stenosis.
CT head [**11-15**]:  IMPRESSION: Evolution of left MCA infarct with slightly increased mass effect on the left lateral ventricle without midline shift.
No hemorrhage seen.
XR L shoulder/elbow [**2166-11-16**]:  RIGHT SHOULDER: There is a possible non-displaced fracture of the lateral acromion.
A well-corticated fragment within the right shoulder is consistent with calcific tendinopathy of the supraspinatus tendon and is chronic in nature.
There is mild osteoarthritis of the AC and glenohumeral joints.
No focal lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.
RIGHT ELBOW AND FOREARM: No fracture or dislocation is seen.
There is osteoarthritis of the ulnar trochlear joint as well as calcific tendinopathy of the common extensor tendon.
No focal lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.
Possible nondisplaced fracture of the lateral acromion.
Osteoarthritis of the right shoulder and elbow.
On initial examination he was he had intact comprehension, motor aphasia, R face/arm weakness >> R leg weakness.
CT head showed a hyperdense MCA sign.
ED course was complicated by sinus bradycardia to 30s.
Patient was treated per stroke protocl of HOB < 30, IVF, SBP autoregulation, ASA, statin and normoglycemia/normothermia maintenance.
MRI head showed a new large LEFT basal ganglia and left caudate and putamen as well as the anterior limb of the internal capsule.
In additin, there were scattered strokes in left centrum semiovale, all of this suggesting an embolic etiology.
MRA showed complete occlusion of the L MCA as well as near complete occlusion of [**Doctor First Name 3098**].
ECHO showed no source of embolism and no afib was noted on Telemetry.
His examination progressed by HD2 to global aphasia and R side plegia.
He underwent a S&S evaluation that resulted in requiring ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
At time of discharge his examination was remarkable for global, but motor predominant aphasia and R sided hemiplegia.
Patient was noted to have sinus bradycardia while in the ED.
Cardiology was consulted and it was felt that this was due to increased vagal tone.
Patient continued to have episodes of asymptomatic bradycardia while asleep.
Medications can be titrated to goal listed above by increasing Lisinopril first, followed by addition of the either amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide.
This was felt to be multifactorial, from increased prostatic size and possible impairment of frontal lobes due to edema from the stroke.
ORTHO:  Unfortunately on [**11-16**] patient experience a fall from a chair, despite being on fall precautions and chair alarm trying to sit up from a chair.
Unfortunately patient was c/o of R shoulder pain and was found to have a R acromion mildly displaced fracture.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.

You underwent an evaluation for this and you were found to have a blockage in one of your neck arteries that caused your stroke.
