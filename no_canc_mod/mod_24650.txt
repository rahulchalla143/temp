Admission Date:  [**2183-8-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-9-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-4-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Pt is 57 yo active female with PMH notable for osteoperosis, newly diagnosed with dermatomyositis 2 months ago with rapidly progressive ILD now transferred from OSH for worsening hypoxia.
In early [**Name (NI) **], pt developed a rash (not itching or painful, looked like red papules) on her toes, knuckles and elbows after working in the bushes in her yard.
She was diagnosed as possible poison [**Female First Name (un) **] and treated with prednisone, which caused her symptoms to improve.
Pt was subsequently seen be a dermatologist who did a biopsy, which diagnosed dermatomyosotis w/ mildly elevated CPK's and Anti-Jo1 antibody negative.
Pt did not have muscle weakness, pain or any trouble breathing during this time.
CT chest showed low levels of interstitial fibrotic changes.
In mid-[**Month (only) **], pt was seen by a rheumatologist who started azothioprine for a few days, which was quickly discontinued bc pt developed loss of sense of smell and taste.
Pt started developing some muscle and joint pains off and on.
End of [**Name (NI) 205**], pt had a pan CT to r/o malignancy, which showed a suspicious pancreatic mass.
Pt grardually developed shortness of breath, having trouble with exertion, climbing up stairs.
Also reports some proximal muscle weakness in her legs/hips (deep knee bends).
End of [**Name (NI) 216**], pt had a EGD and colonoscopy that were negative, and then a EUS which showed a normal pancreas.
2 days ago, pt saw her pulmonologist who reports desaturation to the mid 80's on exertion, sent home on oxygen, but recalled to the hospital after chest CT showed significant worsened interstitial infiltrates bilaterally.
Family History: Father - Diabetes, emphysema, died of CHF at 82 Mother - [**Name (NI) 2481**] Uncle - colon cancer Cousin - lupus [**Name2 (NI) **] known hx of autoimmune disorders - no RA, scleroderma, sjogren's..
Physical Exam: T= 96.6 BP= 132/78 HR= 87 RR= 22 O2= 94 6L PHYSICAL EXAM: GENERAL: Pleasant, well appearing, having difficulty breathing, speaks about a sentence before needing to catch breath.
HEENT: Facial and chest redness - faded heliotope rash.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
LUNGS: tachypneic, short shallow respirations.
no edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
PSYCH: Listens and responds to questions appropriately, pleasant    Pertinent Results: labs on admission 13.6>33.7<222  133 | 100 | 20 ---------------182 3.8 | 21  | 0.7  LDH 686  cxr on admission: FINDINGS: No previous images.
There is severe interstitial change diffusely involving both lungs, most prominent at the bases.
No acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion or cardiomegaly.
The findings are consistent with the clinical diagnosis of dermatomyositis with severe interstitial lung disease.
CT chest on admission: Overall appearances are consistent with PCP and superimposed mild subpleural interstitial lung disease.
Multiple central or lucent areas within the abnormal lung could represent focal air trapping or uninvolved secondary pulmonary lobules.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Enlargement of the gallbladder could represent acalculous cholecystitis in the current setting.

Chest CT showed interstitial disease c/w PCP.
She became increasingly difficult to oxygenate (requiring FiO2s of 65-80% to get O2sats in the high 80s-low 90s) and a repeat CT chest was done which showed worsening of her interstitial disease.
She was also treated empirically for VAP with vanc/cefepime/cipro and also micafungin.
Pt was found to have a pneumomediastinum without pneumothorax which was felt to be unrelated to her acute decompensation.
Eventually, she developed wide complex tachycardia.
Pneumomediastinum likely [**1-20**] PCP bleb popping medially in the setting of high PEEP, the possibility of esophageal rupture after balloon placement was considered, however, pt did not acutely decompensate as would be expected in someone c mediastinitis.
Could also be [**1-20**] esophageal rupture but would expect pt to be spiking temps etc.
Pt was followed c serial cxrs.
# ILD, Dermatomyositis: The patient presented with gottron's papules, helotropic rash, elevated CK, and muscle pain several months ago.
Had been on steroids for worsening sob and ct scan from osh concerning for mild ILD.
#Hyponatremia ??????
Urine lytes were sent which were c/w SIADH.
# Osteoporosis: fosamax was temporarily d/ced as cannot be crushed and given through OGT.
#Elevated PTT: Pt developed elevated PTT in setting of TID sc heparin.
