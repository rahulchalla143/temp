Admission Date:  [**2109-7-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2109-7-31**]  Date of Birth:   [**2054-1-15**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old female with a known history of coronary artery disease, CHF, who presented in pulmonary edema.
Per verbal report, the patient had become very anxious during a thunderstorm, hyperventilating, and had progressive dyspnea on exertion without chest pain.
Upon arrival, EMTs found the patient confused, hypoxic, and severely hypertensive.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History revealed coronary artery disease with a non-Q-wave MI in [**2109-1-22**] and [**2108-9-22**].
Known chronic .......... and has had multiple PCIs including brachytherapy to that lesion.
Pulmonary hypertension.
On previous catheterizations the patient has been noted to have severely PA pressures as high as 90/45.
She has had negative lower extremity Dopplers for DVT in the past as well as CT angiograms felt to demonstrate evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Congestive heart failure with decreased ejection fraction most recently in [**2108-9-22**] showing an EF of 35% to 40% with diffuse hypokinesis inferior and apical akinesis.
Hypothyroidism status post thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter.
Anxiety disorder.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN, WHICH CAUSES EDEMA; ACE WHICH CAUSES A COUGH, AS WELL AS ARBs, which are thought to cause cough and may partially have given her laryngeal edema in the past.
FAMILY HISTORY:  History revealed that the patient is widely positive for diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease.
She had very distant heart sounds, S1 and S2 barely being audible.
Post intubation, the lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly with diffuse rhonchi posteriorly and laterally.
ABDOMEN: Obese, nontender, nondistended with hypoactive bowel sounds.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  (by issue)  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Etiology was thought to be multifactorial with LV failure and subsequently pulmonary edema as well as the severe pulmonary artery hypertension.
The patient was treated aggressively with antihypertensive regimen, as well as diuresis, appropriate amounts of sedation as the patient was highly anxious with minimal stimulation with increase in her pulmonary artery pressures to systolic measurements of 100 mmHg.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed early in the hospital stay to rule out shunting, but there was no evidence of any intracardiac shunting to explain the pulmonary hypertension.
The patient did not have any DVTs to suggest chronic pulmonary embolisms.
Etiology of her chronic pulmonary hypertension was most likely secondary to hypertension of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea, but seemed to be adequately treated with aggressive antihypertensive regimen.
LARYNGEAL EDEMA:  The patient failed her initial extubation because of laryngeal edema with severe stridor that was refractory to inhaled racemic epinephrine.
Subsequent re-attempts at extubation were successful without any evidence of recurrence, laryngeal edema.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had spiked fevers and elevated white counts earlier in the hospitalization course with right lower lobe infiltrate.
The patient was thought to be in aspiration pneumonia secondary to her emergence intubation.
ELEVATED CREATININE:  During the stay in the Intensive Care Unit while on mechanical ventilation, the patient had periods of elevation creatinine kinase to the level of 6000 with negative MB fraction.
This was thought to be a myositis or rhabdomyolysis and secondary to prolonged immobilization.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Anxiety disorder.
Diabetes mellitus.
Chronic anxiety.
