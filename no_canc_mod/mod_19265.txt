The degree of mass effect is unaltered.
There is no hydrocephalus.
There are low lung volumes on the exam.
There is left basilar atelectasis.
Opacity at the right lower lung field may represent atelectasis and adjacent small pleural effusion, but a somewhat nodular contour is noted to the pulmonary component of this opacity.
2) New patchy left lower lobe opacity which may relate to either atelectasis or aspiration.
3) Resolved right basilar opacity with residual small right effusion.
