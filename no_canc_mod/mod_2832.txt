[**Hospital1 18**], Division of Cardiothorac [**Hospital Unit Name 4081**] [**Location (un) 86**], [**Numeric Identifier 718**]  Status: Inpatient DOB: [**2079-12-15**] Age (years): 77 F  Hgt (in): 64 BP (mm Hg): 123/60  Wgt (lb): 119 HR (bpm): 96  BSA (m2): 1.57 m2 Indication: Aortic valve disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
Left ventricular function.
Mitral valve disease.
Shortness of breath.
Valvular heart disease.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA.
Depressed LAA emptying velocity (<0.2m/s) No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
See Conclusions for post-bypass data  Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A central jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced, on no inotropes.
There is a mitral annuloplasty ring in good position.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
No paravalvular leak is seen.
There is no mitral stenosis with a mean gradient of 2mmHg at a cardiac output of 3.7 L/min.
There is a tricuspid annuloplasty ring in good position.
There is no tricuspid regurgitation.
No paravalvular leak is seen.
There is a mean gradient of 1 mmHg across the tricuspid valve with cardiac output at 3.7 L/min.. Aortic regurgitation is mild to moderate ([**12-26**]+).
Assess right pleural effusion.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left have both decreased since [**9-29**] and pulmonary vascular engorgement in the upper lobes and previous mild pulmonary edema in the lower has decreased as well.
No pneumothorax.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 18334**] Reason: eval for right effusion/ apical thickening/ neoplasm Contrast: VISAPAQUE Amt: 75CC [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    77 year old woman s/p mv repair/ tv repair with preoperative apical thickening on the right, chronicity undetermined REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    eval for right effusion/ apical thickening/ neoplasm CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:    None.
Final Report INDICATION: Status post mitral valve repair and tricuspid repair with preoperative thickening on the right.
Nodular opacities in the lingula (2:31) measuring 8 mm and in the right middle lobe (2:35) are likely secondary to infectious or inflammatory foci.
Atelectasis is present.
Small pleural effusions are present without evidence for nodularity or loculation.
The patient is recently status post cardiac surgery with a small amount of air in the anterior mediastinum.
A minimal left anterior pneumothorax is present (3:36).
A small amount of air is located subdiaphragmatically (2:56) which is likely due to the presence of a small posterior diaphragmatic defect better evaluated on the CT abdomen examination from [**2152-10-17**].
A region of thrombus at inferior wall of the the aortic arch measuring 11 x 3 mm is only slightly increased in size since the prior examination.
The lobes of the thyroid appear normal.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are present in the axilla, hilum, or mediastinum.
Although not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate a small fat-containing defect in the right posterior diaphragm.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious bone lesions are present.
Apical thickening, but without discrete mass identified.
Nodularity in the lingula, and right middle lobe which is likely infectious in etiology, but a 3-month followup chest CT should be performed to assess for resolution.
Extensive subcutaneous and mediastinal air related to recent surgery.
Trace amount of left anterior subdiaphragmatic air may relate to prior chest tube or air tracking through a previously noted small diaphragmatic defect.
Small trace basilar left pneumothorax.
Minimal increased size of thrombus at the aortic arch.
Enlarged pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary hypertension, which is little changed since [**2151**].
On POD2, pacing wires were removed and coumadin was resumed for chronic atrial fibrillation.
Narcotics were held due to lethargy.
By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with acetaminophen.
5. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day): hold for loose stools.
