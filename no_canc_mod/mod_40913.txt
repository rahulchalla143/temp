Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
No HSM or tenderness.
Some RLQ abdomen ecchymosis GU: Scrotal/groin swelling and eccyhmoses reduced but still present.
Skin with some blistering from clamp placement EXTREMITIES: 1+ edema R>L, improved from admission SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Limited peripheral angiography demonstrated a no plaquing in the abdominal aorta.
The right lower extremity had a 40% stenosis in the right external iliac with no flow limiting disease downstream.
The left lower extremity had a 90% stenosis in the external iliac artery with no flow limiting disease downstream and preserved three vessl runoff.
Peripheral arterial disease.
Moderately elevated systolic hypertension.
No evidence of pseudoaneurysm in the right inguinal region.
A 2.8 cm hematoma is noted in the high right inguinal region and might represent the thrombosed remnant of the previously seen pseudoaneurysm.
Deep venous thrombosis of the right common femoral and deep femoral veins.
No deep venous thrombosis in left lower extremity.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old man with a left external iliac artery stenosis and claudication s/p stenting [**2123-10-11**] c/b R groin/scrotal hematoma .
He later coughed, felt a popping sensation, and became hypotensive and presyncopal.
The following day an ultrasound showed no pseudoaneurysm but did show a DVT.
#DVT: Provoked in the setting of FemStop clamp decreasing venous return.
#PAD: He underwent succesful stenting of his left external iliac artery through right femoral artery access complicated by R Groin hematoma as above.
Torsemide was chosen instead of a thiazide diuretic because of his low GFR.
He may need further uptitration of his lisinopril if his blood pressure increases after clonidine is discontinued.
He did have some mild shortness of breath so ipratropium inhaler was started.
