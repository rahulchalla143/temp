No ST/T changes.
Compared to prior dated [**2164-1-10**], atrial fibrillation is new.
CXR showed minimal opacity in left lung base likely representing atelectasis/scar as there is no obscuration of the hemidiaphgragm.
There are low lung volumes, which may represent COPD.
CT abdomen/pelvis showed "no acute abnormality."
She had gradual worsening of hemodynamics with BP trending down from 130s to 90s for which she received 4 L NS.

# Sepsis/cholangitis: Patient meets sepsis criteria on presentation with fever, tachpynea with blood cultures suggestive of high grade bacteremia from GNR (in OSH cultures).
CXR not suggestive of pulmonic process initially.
Her sacral decubitus ulcer, present on [**Month/Day/Year **], does not appear infected.
Hypotension responded to 4 L fluid resuscitation.
Intra-abdominal imaging and US at OSH not suggestive of gallstone or other acute intraabdominal process however given RUQ pain, elevated LFTs/Tbili, and fever, ERCP was performed with sphincterotomy, decompression with extraction of pus and stone.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable with LFTs improving, on broad spectrum antibiotics, ultimately tailored to ceftriaxone for bacteremia and with flagyl given ?
of aspiration pneumonia (see below).
# Hypoxemia: Per nursing home notes, there was some concern about a heart failure exacerbation (although do not have formal documentation of such history) with home medications including lasix and spironolactone.
CXR was without pulmonary edema or other pulmonic process but did have cardiomegaly.
Per nursing home notes, concern about CHF given weight increased 9 lbs from [**2170-12-5**].
Patient is at aspiration risk, and though she's been given nectar thick liquids, she may have aspirated contributing to her oxygen sats in the low 90s at times, and repeat chest xray suggested possible aspiration pneumonia in the mid left and lower lung zones.
# Supratherapeutic INR: Reversed for ERCP.
Likely pre-renal etiology on [**Month (only) **] given insensible losses with fevers with Cr trending down with fluid resuscitation.
# Left leg swelling: Patient has reported history of both LLE DVT and ?
No evidence of DVT on LENI U/S performed at [**Hospital1 18**] this [**Hospital1 **].
# Skin impairments: Stage 3 decubitus ulcer and multiple skin breakdowns on left lower extremities was managed by wound care, and with frequent turnings.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation on [**Hospital1 **], high CHADS2 score given ?CHF, HTN, age, diabetes mellitus type II, prior stroke.
High risk for cardioembolic issues.
# Diabetes mellitus type II: Managed on HISS and lantus.
Per nursing home documents, she cannot make medical decisions due to underlying dementia  # Aspiration risk: Patient with known aspiration risk per nursing home records.
Patient was given thickened nectar liquids.
# QTc prolongation: QTc was 463 ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
