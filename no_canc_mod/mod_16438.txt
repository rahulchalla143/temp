The IVF donor egg pregnancy was complicated by twin gestation, cerclage for cervical change at 22 weeks and discordant growth with maternal cholestasis and late onset of hypertension.
C section was performed for progressive hypertension and cholestasis.
Artificial membranes are ruptured at time of delivery yielding clear amniotic fluid for both twins.
No risk factors for infection including maternal fever or signs of chorioamnionitis.
This patient's newborn course was significant for second twin emerging breech with primary apnea responsive to tactile stimulation and brief (less than one minute) bagged mask ventilation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Fragile appearing infant in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Anterior fontanel open and soft, nondysmorphic facies.
Neck and mouth within normal, no nasal flaring.
Chest:  No retractions, good breath sounds bilaterally, no crackles.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmur present.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended, no organomegaly, no masses.
Respiratory:  Beyond original need for PPV with resuscitation, the patient never had issues from a respiratory standpoint.
She has never been noted to have a murmur.
Criteria for weaning from NeoSure include weight, head circumference, and length about the 10th percentile, and gaining over 15 grams/kg/day, or patient achieving six months corrected gestational age.
Infectious diseases:  C section was performed without prior rupture of the membranes and for maternal indications.
For this reason, no rule out sepsis was necessary.
Criteria for weaning off NeoSure include greater than 10th percentile for weight, head circumference, and length, and gaining over 15 grams/kg/day or approximately 6 months corrected gestational age.
