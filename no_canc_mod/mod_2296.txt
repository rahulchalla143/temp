Her pain started on [**11-20**] at 9pm 45 minutes after taking her pm medications.
Her nausea was followed by nausea and she had an episode of emesis at 10pm.
The pain is in the epigastrium and wraps around to her back.
She has not had this kind of pain before.
She had flatus and a bowel movement after the pain started.
Transplant surgery is consulted for management of abdominal pain in a patient s/p kidney txp.
ROS: She denies any fevers or chills.
The sputum is occasionally purulent but she has chronic sinus disease and this is her baseline.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: ESRD [**2-4**] PKD, Nephrolithiasis, History of HTN (no longer on meds), Chronic sinusitis, pancreatic/hepatic cysts, breast CA, toxoplasmosis, rectocele and rectal prolapse  PSH: bilat nephrectomy for PKD [**2193-9-3**], L mastectomy and LAD, spinal fusion, TAH, Mesenteric LN bx, RUE AVF s/p multiple interventions over last 2 years, last balloon angioplasty [**7-11**].
Physical Exam: VS T 99 HR 94 BP 114/47 RR 18 SAT 100%RA Gen: A and O x 3, NAD Card: RRR Pulm: CTA Abd: Soft minimally TTP epigastrium and LUQ.
No evidence of obstruction  RUQ US: GB wall dilation 3-4mm.
No sludge, no stones.
No intra or extrahepatic bile duct dilation.
A HIDA scan was done demonstrating no evidence of cholecystitis.
She continued to have abdominal pain.
Liver duplex was done to assess for cholelithiasis.
No cholelithiasis was noted.
There was no extra, or intra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
Abdominal and pelvic CT with contrast was done noting thickening of the proximal small bowel in addition to mild dilation with transition point in the left mid abdomen.
There was non-specific thickening of gastric pyloris wall and unchanged multiple liver and pancreatic cysts.
On [**11-23**], a CTA of the abd/pevis was done to re-eval for SBO and to assess for bowel ischemia.
Findings were as follows:  Mechanical small-bowel obstruction with transition point in the left lower abdomen with configuration of transition point suggesting closed loop obstruction possibly due to internal hernia.
No major order mesenteric vascular occlusion is seen.
The small bowel proximal to the level of obstruction is thick walled and edematous raising the possibility of venous engorgement versus ischemia related to obstruction.
There is ascites which appears slightly worse to the prior study.
There is mild-to-moderate celiac artery and mild superior mesenteric artery ostial stenosis.
Multiple hepatic and pancreatic cysts.
Tiny nonspecific hypodensities are seen in the spleen.
Unless there is clinical concern for opportunistic infection, these are unlikely to be of significance.
In the setting of immunosuppression, however, fungal infection is not excluded.
Given persistent/progressive abdominal pain and CT findings, she was taken to the OR on [**2194-11-23**].
Postop, pain was managed with PCA dilaudid.
Urine output dropped postop and IV fluid bolus was given with increased urine output.
She had an O2 requirement with desat's to 70s.
CXR demonstrated bilateral small  pleural effusions consistent with volume overload.
There was evidence of chronic pulmonary hypertension.
