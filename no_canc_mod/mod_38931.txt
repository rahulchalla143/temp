The patient initially presented to LGH ED with hypoxemic respiratory distress.
While at the OSH, he became confused and subsequently had an episode of PEA arrest and was intubated.
In addition, he had bilateral needle thoracostomies with report of air return on the left, and he subsequently had bilateral chest tubes placed.
He received vecuronium and was started on an epi gtt for asthma and a cooling protocol, and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Of note, the patient was admitted to LGH in [**1-4**] for dyspnea, and was subsequently diagnosed with a CAP and asthma treated with CTX and azithromycin.
Per his family, he has also had multiple admissions this winter for asthma exacerbations.
Past Medical History: Asthma Dilated cardiomyopathy Multiple admissions for dyspnea this winter ([**1-26**]).
Anxiety/depression CKD HLD Obesity HTN  Social History: Unknown  Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: ADMISSION: VS: 35.9 124 129/67 99% AC 480x24, 5, 1.0 Gen: ETT in place, intubated, sedated.
CV: Tachy S1+S2 Pulm: Poor air movement bilaterally.
Diffuse wheezes bilaterally.
Loss of retrocardiac diagphragm and bilateral opacities (L>R) .
[**Month (only) 116**] consider advancing for optimal placement.
Severe cardiomegaly with globular shape.
In the absence of prior comparison, the differential is broad, including moderate pericardial effusion, mediastinal hemorrhage, or acute cardiac failure.
CTH: My read, no acute bleed .
No evidence of pulmonary embolism, although evaluation of subsegmental branches is limited.
Moderate cardiomegaly without pericardial effusion.
Bilateral dependent atelectasis.
Multiple nondisplaced rib fractures on the right, some of which are subacute.
Also possible subtle nondisplaced fractures of the left ribs.
Nondisplaced acute sternal fracture in addition to a subacute nondisplaced sternal fracture.
TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction ?
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
EEG [**2-27**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the slow and disorganized background of 6.5 Hz with bursts of generalized slowing that showed no clear reactivity.
These findings indicate a severe encephalopathy.
No clear epileptiform discharges or seizures were seen.
LUMBAR SPINE [**2115-3-11**]  CLINICAL INFORMATION: Evidence of fracture, seizure, fall, low back pain.
FINDINGS:  Three views of the lumbar spine demonstrate mild narrowing of the left femoroacetabular joint.
There is mild scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine.
However, there is a compression fracture of L1, with compression of the superior endplate, and a sclerotic fracture line.
Given the mechanism of fall, if there is acute pain referable to L1, then this would be considered an acute finding.
There is no apparent retropulsion of the posterior margin of L1 into the spinal canal.
No other fractures are identified at this time.
There is early calcification of the aorta.
IMPRESSION: Compression fracture of L1 with anterior wedge deformity, likely an acute finding.
No other fractures identified.
Complete right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Diffuse ST-T wave changes laterally.
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation.
Paranasal sinuses demonstrate fluid in the sphenoid air cells and right posterior ethmoid air cell, likely related to prolonged hospitalization.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3234**] is a 36 year old gentleman with a PMH signifciant with dilated cardiomyopathy s/p AICD, PE not on anticoagulation, asthma, and HTN admitted to an OSH with dyspnea now the transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU after PEA arrest x2.
# PEA arrest and subsequent anoxic brain injury.
: Suspect that original OSH PEA arrest due to hypoxemia or acidosis, with [**Hospital1 18**] ED PEA arrest due to acidosis with admission pH 7.16 on arrival.
TTE with evidence of RV failure to suggest PE.
LVEF 30% with known dilated cardiomyopathy.
He became more interactive on transfer to the floor, was initially speaking in spanish and English and not always making sense but then started responding more appropiately and following commands.
On hospital day 11 he had a witnessed grand mal seizure and was given ativan and started on Keppra with neurology consult.
He had a subsequent seizure on [**3-18**] with LUE tonic clonic activity and impaired consciousness but this resolved spontaneously after 1-2 minutes.
At the time of discharge the patient was alert, oriented (though not always to date), following commands but impulsive with poor motor planning leading to several falls.
Neurology notes indicate the patient has the potential toimprove from a neurologic standpoint.
He also may have recurrent seizures which should be treated with ativan IV or IM and do not neccessarily indicate patient needs to return to hospital unless they continue for greater than 5 minutes or he has multiple recurrent seizures or complications such as aspiration.
-patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in his s/p arrest neurology clinic -patient will require intensive PT and OT in an anoxic brain injury unit.
# Respiratory failure: Believed to be due to status asthmaticus, although inciting event unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) 227**] multiple cardiac arrests, also a concern for development of ARDS.
His oxygenation was improved with diuresis and agitation was better controlled with seroquel.
His Asthma was treated with standing and PRN albuterol and ipratriopium and a slow prednisone taper which he l completed on [**2115-3-18**] and he was restarted on Advair -patient may require additional nebs on top of his standing advair though his respiratory status has been very stable, without wheezing for the last week.
# Ventilator associated pneumonia:  Patient developed a fever on [**2-27**] with new infiltrates on chest xray while intubated.
# Myoclonus: when mental status improved, was noted to have myoclonic jerks.
Also continued on home dose of carvedilol and Lisinopril but ACE downtitrated from 40 to 20 when had elevated Cr 1.9 on [**3-18**] and slightly low BPs high 90s/60s.
# L1 compression fracture: After the patient fell, he was complaining of low back pain so a L-spine Xray was performed and showed L1 compressin fracture with No cord impingement on imaging.
The patient had no localizing deficits on serial neuro exam.
Calcitonin was tried for pain with compression fracture but this did not seem to help with symptoms so was discontinued.
# Leukocytosis: WBC >20  persistently in the MICU even after being treated for infection.
Since no new infection was found this was presumed [**12-26**] steroids and the leukocytosis improved with prednisone taper.
