Admission Date:  [**2122-5-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-6-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-11-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**] Chief Complaint: motorcycle collision into trees  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Intramedullary rod fixation of left subtrochanteric femur fracture 4.
Pt was found prone in the [**Doctor Last Name 6641**], seen at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 11042**], found to have pulmonary contusions, kidney and liver lacerations and a left femur fx and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
trachea midline.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is marked bibasilar dependent atelectasis with small bilateral effusions.
There is a lobulated soft tissue density mass measuring 3.5 cm in the right lower lobe in the region of large contusion from [**5-22**] that likely represents coalescing hemorrhage.
Multiple small other ill-defined and nodular densities are present throughout the lungs (right greater than left that also probably represent pulmonary contusion).
Small apical pneumothorax has resolved.
Subcutaneous gas within the right soft tissues is present secondary to chest tube.
There are multiple rib fractures identified, including posterior right rib fractures of the ninth, eighth ribs at the spinous articulation.
The left kidney enhances and excretes normally.
Bibasilar consolidations with airbronchograms indicate atelectasis and/or infection.
Multiple other ill- defined opacities in the lungs may be contusion or developing infection.
Multiple rib fractures.
Sequela of traumatic injury in the visualized abdomen as described above.
Contrast: OPTIRAY  INDICATION: Eval for stridor or failed extubation.
FINDINGS: There is lobulated mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses and partial fluid air opacification of the ethmoid air cells.
Bilateral medial maxillary defects suggest previous sinus surgery.
Soft tissue density above the endotracheal tube balloon suggests soft tissue swelling or combination of secretions.
The visualized portions of the lung apices contain multiple small ill-defined opacities that may be small contusions versus small developing infection given this patient's clinical history.
Small amount of atelectasis is identified within the dependent portion of the right lung apex.
There is near complete opacification of both mastoid air cells, likely from fluid that was not present on [**2122-5-22**].
IMPRESSION: Mucosal fluid opacification of multiple sinuses with soft tissue swelling/secretions within the pharynx.
LINE PLACEMENT  Reason: check CVL, f/u hemothorax  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 19 year old man s/p MCC now intubated w R ptx, effusion, pulm contusion REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: check CVL, f/u hemothorax INDICATION: 19-year-old man status post motor vehicle collision, now intubated with right pneumothorax, effusion, and pulmonary contusion, assess for central venous line.
No pneumothorax is identified.
There has been obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm suggesting atelectasis.
Again seen is right basilar opacity consistent with known contusion in this region, slightly improved.
Slightly decreased opacity in the right lower lung consistent with contusion, atelectasis or aspiration.

ptx ?
Question pneumothorax or effusions.
Extent of hemorrhage in the right lower lung has decreased.
A smaller amount of hemorrhage in the perihilar left lower lung is stable.
There is diffuse air space opacity of the right lung consistent with pulmonary contusion.
There is hazy opacity of the left lung, probably representing less severe contusion.
No definite pneumothorax is found.
There is no free air under the diaphragm.
There is a complete subtrochanteric left femoral fracture.
No other fractures are identified in the pelvis.
Massive right pulmonary contusion and less severe left contusion.
Complete subtrochanteric left femoral fracture.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or major vascular territorial infarction.
There is no evidence of fracture.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or fracture.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT of the cervical spine.
There is no evidence of fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained after 130 mL of Optiray IV contrast.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is extensive airspace opacity of the right lung consistent with contusion.
There are multiple small pneumatoceles.
Also noted is a small anterior right pneumothorax.
A moderate portion of the left posterior lung is also contused.
The heart and great vessels of the chest opacify well, and there is no evidence of vascular injury.
There is a small subcapsular tear associated with the posterior right hepatic laceration with a small amount of associated blood layering around the inferior liver margin.
There is lack of perfusion to the posterior right kidney as well as a small right perirenal hematoma, which is concerning for vascular pedicle injury.
There is an adjacent right adrenal hematoma as well.
There is no free intra- abdominal air or fluid.
There is no extravasation of contrast outside of the vasculature or bowel.
There is no free pelvic fluid.
BONE WINDOWS: There is a complete subtrochanteric left femoral fracture.
There is mild prominence of the adjacent musculature, but no discrete hematoma.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are found.
Massive right pulmonary contusion with multiple small pneumatoceles.
Moderate left pulmonary contusion.
Small anterior right pneumothorax.
At least four peripheral superficial hepatic lacerations involving more than three hepatic segments consistent with a grade IV liver injury.
Lack of perfusion to the posterior right kidney with a small perirenal hematoma concerning for vascular pedicle injury.
Complete subtrochanteric fracture of the left femur.
AP PELVIS, TWO VIEWS RIGHT HIP: Again demonstrated is the severely displaced and angulated subtrochanteric fracture in the left hip.
THREE VIEWS, LEFT FEMUR: No acute fracture.
THREE VIEWS, LEFT TIBIA/FIBULA: No acute fracture or dislocation.
No radiopaque foreign bodies.
THREE VIEWS, LEFT ANKLE: No acute fracture or dislocation.
TWO VIEWS, LEFT KNEE: No acute fracture or dislocation.
No joint effusion.
SUPINE AP CHEST: There has been placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates at the level of thoracic inlet.
There is diffuse increased opacity throughout the right hemithorax consistent with the areas of consolidation/injury on the concurrent CT scan.
The tiny right-sided pneumothorax and right posterior rib fractures on the CT scan are not as evident on this study.
Less pronounced areas of patchy airspace opacity are also demonstrated at the left base.
Pt was found prone in the [**Doctor Last Name 6641**], seen at St. [**Doctor Last Name 11042**], found to have pulmonary contusions, kidney and liver lacerations and a left femur fx, and was tx'd to [**Hospital1 18**].
Pt was admitted to the Trauma/Surgical ICU where he was soon intubated due to pulmonary concerns.
Over the first week his vent settings were weaned slowly, but patient failed extubation twice and was noted to have some abnormal laryngeal swelling on ENT evaluation (which may have contributed to failed extubations and failure to wean from vent).
There were no orthopedics post-op complications.

Regarding his tracheostomy, pt has failed 2 Passey-Muir evaluations due to excess secretions and laryn/pharyngeal swelling that required trach placement.
