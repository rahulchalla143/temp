His most recent hospital admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] was from [**2168-9-6**] to [**2168-9-8**] for CHF in the setting of poorly controlled hypertension.
At baseline, the patient shouts infrequently in his native Creole language, but the staff noted that he was shouting more frequently last night; they also note that he seemed more confused than normal.
He denied any pain symptoms when questioned by the staff.
Due to concern about the patient's change in mental status and possible pain at the femoral line site, he did not undergo his dialysis treatment and was taken to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department for evaluation.
The CXR showed chronic LLL consolidation, RLL consolidation that had been noted on the previous admission and has not yet resolved, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions.
The CT of the head showed no acute intracranial pathology.
The patient was given 1 gram of ceftazidime, 1 gram of vancomycin, epoetin, 5 mcg of paricalcitol, 62.5 mg of ferric gluconate.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to be hyperkalemic and to have an INR of 1.3.
Given the persistence of the RLL consolidation, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 139**] general medical service for work-up of his mental status change and treatment of pneumonia.
Review of Systems: Per report from [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32726**] at the Nursing Home, the patient has not had any recent cough, fever, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
MICU Txfer: Reason for transfer: Bradyacardia and AMS .
On [**2168-9-19**], patient was found to be unresponsive/lethargic and bradycardic to the 40s.
He was in Afib and did not have any changes on his EKG.
On Transfer to floor from MICU: Summary of MICU course--The episode of AMS that brought him to the MICU was accompanied by bradycardia and hypotension.
Neuro was consulted about a finding of possible stroke on CT which they felt was not clinically consistent with his physical exam.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 yo w PMHx of HTN, ESRD on dialysis, CHF, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recently completedcourse of vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia, CAD s/p CABG and LAD stenting, and past CVA who was admitted and treated for mental status changes secondary to Enterobacter bacteremia who's hospitalization was complicated by MICU stay for acute change in mental status and bradycardia which had resolved by discharge.
He had an acute decompensation on [**9-19**] for which he was transfered to the MICU.
The episode of AMS that brought him to the MICU was accompanied by bradycardia and hypotension.
Neuro was consulted about a finding of possible stroke on CT which they felt was not clinically consistent with his physical exam.
# Bacteremia-MRSA and Enterobacter: Positive cultures on [**9-12**] and [**9-15**] with ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE sensitive to meropenum.
# CXR with bilateral consolidations/pleural effusions: CXR shows worsening pleural effusions and he has a persistant oxygen requirement.
Likely secondary to chronic CHF.
# End Stage Renal Disease: This patient has ESRD and is on dialysis (MWF schedule).
His INR was reversed with 10 vit K for this procedure.
# Bradycardia: Resolved.
Unclear etiology: possibly med effect-received metoprolol on night before MICU admission, ruled out cardiac event with negative cardiac enzymes.
# Hypertension: Patient has baseline hypertension normally treated with multiple drugs.
Patient had episode of hypotension prompting unit transfer.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Goal INR = 2.0 to 3.0.
# Mass in R Atrium:  We spoke with echo [**Location (un) 1131**] room who read it as a ra "lump".
He felt that it was not a myxoma, thrombus, or cancer, but rather more likely hypertrophy.
He said that it would not likely increase risk of endocarditis over normal anatomy.
Laboratory studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
