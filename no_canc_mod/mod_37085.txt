HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old female hospitalized at an outside hospital on [**5-1**] with several sputum production.
She was intubated at that time for a questionable congestive heart failure or hypercarbia.
Over the course of the hospitalization, she was extubated and reintubated times two for fatigue, hypercarbia plus or minus hypoxia.
In mid [**Month (only) **], she developed hypotension and creatinine started to rise rapidly.
At that point, she not be done because she had severe central stenosis of all vessels and no access was attempted at that point due to fear of more thrombosis as patient had a transplanted kidney, which was the only accessible vein.
She was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for decisions about access and treatment of her renal failure.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol, no tobacco.
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
In addition, outside venogram demonstrated central stenosis of all upper extremity vessels and the left femoral was not accessible.
She has continued to have poor intravenous access at hospital.
After the placement of the Quinton, she started to experience a drop in hematocrit and was currently being heparinized at the time for multiple deep vein thromboses in the past.
Abdominal CT at the time showed no retroperitoneal bleed, but there was a large hematoma surrounding the Quinton.
Patient's hematoma then stabilized on the [**5-28**] with a tense hematoma at the site of the Quinton catheter, approximately 10 cm in diameter and the total hematoma was 25 x 25 cm.
Over the course of her stay, she was extubated, but required BiPAP at night for sleeping due to questionable sleep apnea and/or hypoxic episodes due to her obesity.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES FROM THE FLOOR:  End stage renal disease with multiple access problems.
