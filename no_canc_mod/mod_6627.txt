Pt was made NPO after the video swallow due to fatigue and aspiration combined with overall medical status.
we were reconsulted after extubation on [**11-28**] but at that point pt had excess secretions and was noted to aspirate during oral care.
Speech was wfl, but vocal quality was hoarse with low volume.
Pt could increase volume slightly on command, but not to normal volume, concerning for vocal cord damage.
Able to follow all basic commands  Secretions: mild dried secretions in the posterior oral cavity, could not clear given strong gag reflex  ORAL MOTOR EXAM: Pt presented with symmetrical facial appearance with adequate lip seal and buccal tongue.
Palatal elevation mildly reduced but gag reflex intact.
Oral transit was wfl without oral residue.
Pt did not have overt coughing or throat clearing after the tsps of nectar thick liquid, then delayed throat clear after the 2nd cup sip of nectar thick liquid.
Pt did not have any signs of aspiration after purees.
Laryngeal elevation timely but mildly reduced.
Moderate-sized right pleural effusion has not changed while a small left pleural effusion has increased in volume since [**12-3**].
Severe cardiomegaly is stable as is mild interstitial edema.
After stabilization in the ED with appropriate meds and lab work-up, pt was brought for a cardiac catheterization.
Cath revealed a hazy LMCA, 90% LAD, serial 90% lesion in the OMs, and no obstructive dz in the RCA except for collaterals to the AM.
Echo revealed an EF>55% w/ [**2-3**]+ MR, 2+ TR, and mild pulm.
Pt's surgery was delayed several days secondary to elevated INR and was awaiting her INR to decrease less than 1.3 prior to surgery.
Diuretics were initiated on POD #1 and Inotropes were continued for BP control.
Her chest tubes were removed and post chest tube pull revealed no pneumothorax.
Renal was consulted on POD #9 to eval for acidosis/renal failure.
had slowly worsening respiratory distress/acidosis/oxygenation and despite PT, diuretics, inhalers, oxygen she was reintubated on POD #11.
CXR revealed b/l pleural effusion and significant interstitial pulmonary congestion (bilat.
Chest CT [**11-25**] revealed bilat pleural effusions, adjacent atelectasis, pulmonary edema w/ patchy peripheral opacities, moderate pericardial effusion, and retrosternal fluid collection.
continued to have elevated WBC, along with fevers post-operatively.
had to be transfused red cells multiple times d/t low HCT.
She continued to have AFib and will be discharged with Amiodarone and Coumadin.
was slowly improving and hemodyanimcally stable.
