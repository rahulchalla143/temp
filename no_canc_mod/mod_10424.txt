Admission Date:  [**2180-11-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-12-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2114-12-8**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEUROLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old woman who presented to [**Hospital1 69**] for difficulty speaking.
She has past medical history of a-fib, hypertension, status post MI, prior stroke and most significantly, a 10 year history of inflammatory brain disease which has not been convincingly diagnosed.
She presents with a two day course of progressive slurred speech and difficulty speaking.
She was apparently in her usual state of health until two days prior to admission when her husband noted that her speech was slurred.
She also had trouble eating.
She has been followed very closely by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who has seen her in the past for a long history of diffuse white matter disease since [**2170**].
She was mildly apraxic and made object substitutions.
Tongue did not protrude and was able to only wiggle side-to-side.
Strength exam had mild left sided drift.
Sensory exam was limited due to language difficulty, however, she did withdraw to pain bilaterally.
Gait was narrow based and normal with some slight left sided limp.
She had an MRI from [**2180-4-12**] which showed multiple white matter lesions in the entire brain and brain stem.
There was also a large right occipital lesion.
MRI showed multiple distal stenoses of vessels.
Repeat MRI on admission from [**2180-11-26**] with and without contrast showed a left frontoparietal area of white matter edema with enhancement that does not have the characteristic appearance of an infarct and suspicious for neoplasm.
Differential diagnosis at that point included glioma [**Month/Day/Year 23318**] lymphoma [**Month/Day/Year 23318**] inflammatory process.
We discussed with the family that biopsy would yield hopefully a definitive diagnosis for this patient.
She has been treated with steroid courses numerous times in the past as she has had similar episodes of aphasia and similar symptoms, in general, and all of these have been well served with steroids.
On [**11-28**] she had an episode of facial twitching.
This EEG showed abnormal EEG due to the slow background with additional bursts of generalized slowing which suggested dysfunction of deep midline structures as can be seen with moderate to midline encephalopathy.
There was also additional left temporal slowing with sharp and spike and wave discharges over the left frontoparietal region and this indicated focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction and could be related to epileptogenesis.
There were no electrographic seizures noted during the trace.
Biopsy was performed on [**12-1**] without complications.
She had some difficulty with increased blood pressure and we needed to increase metoprolol and ramipril.
She is to have speech and swallow evaluations as an outpatient in rehab and she needs a video swallow within one week to further assess her swallowing and aspiration risk.
However, she had an episode in the morning where she was on the toilet and it looked like she had a vasovagal syncope event.
She did have some mild abdominal pain.
This showed erythema, congestion and exudate and friability in the sigmoid colon compatible with ischemic colitis.
This showed localized wall thickening and adjacent fat stranding of the sigmoid colon with the appearance of diverticulosis.
The inflammatory findings were most consistent with diverticulitis.
However, as direct visualization with colonoscopy suggested ischemic colitis, CT appearance overall was in keeping with that diagnosis as well.
Left temporoparietal brain lesion.
Ischemic colitis.
Seizure disorder secondary to #1.
However, preliminary report shows acute inflammatory demyelination with geographic areas of myelin containing macrophages with partially preserved actins and intensely reactive astrocytes.
She also had extensive perivascular and intraparenchymal infiltration by T-lymphocytes with scattered atypical forms, mitoses and increased proliferation.
The differential diagnosis for this pattern of demyelination includes multiple sclerosis/acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis as well as treated B-cell lymphoma, atypical infection especially viral infection, vasculitis and T-cell lymphoma.
While multiple sclerosis is most likely clinically, given this patient's long history of inflammatory brain lesion, the other etiologies cannot be excluded.
