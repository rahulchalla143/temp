[**12-30**]   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 39868**] is a 61 year old gentleman with a PMH signficant for CAD s/p [**Known lastname 7792**] in [**2-21**] with cardiac catheterization x2 and PTCA in [**2123**], HTN, [**Hospital 39871**] transferred from OSH for chest pain with ECG changes.
The patient states that he developed chest pain yesterday morning described as [**8-24**] chest pressure radiating to both arms associated with dyspnea.
He denies any other associated symptoms including diaphoresis, nausea, or vomiting.
These symptoms lasted for approximately 30 minutes until EMS arrived and symptoms were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
He was taken to OSH where he was found to have ST depressions in the lateral leads.
Overnight, he continued to have chest pain that was requiring additional doses of SL nitroglycerin, so he was started on a nitroglycerin gtt and transferred to OSH CCU.
This morning, he continues to have lateral ST depressions although biomarker negative and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for PCI.
Of note, EMS reports that during transfer from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**], his nitro gtt was stopped mom[**Name (NI) 11711**] and the patient developed chest pain.
Of note, the patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2138-2-16**] for hematemesis secondary to [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear with a hct of 13 complicated by a [**Doctor Last Name 7792**] that was medically managed.
Currently, the patient is chest pain free without anginal equivalent.
He also denies any shortness of breath, diaphorersis, n/v, or pain radiation to his arms or jaw.

**ARTERIOGRAPHY RESULTS MORPHOLOGY % STENOSIS COLLAT.
FROM **RIGHT CORONARY 1) PROXIMAL RCA   DISCRETE 100 **ARTERIOGRAPHY RESULTS MORPHOLOGY % STENOSIS COLLAT.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
D1 had diffuse disease.
The LCX did not have obstructive disease, but OM1 had severe diffuse disease, and OM2 was occluded in the mid portion.
Coronary artery disease.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.

He had persistent lateral ST depressions at OSH, although he has been cardiac biomarker negative, given ECG and persistent chest pain when off nitroglycerin gtt, concerning for ACS.
The patient was taken to cardiac cath on [**2138-12-29**] which showed 3 vessel disease and serial LAD lesions.
He was initially chest pain free after the cath.
He experienced some paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin.
