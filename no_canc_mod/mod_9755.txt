Admission Date:  [**2120-7-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2120-8-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2067-1-15**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Elective surgery for kyphoscoliosis  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 53-year-old woman without significant past medical history, who was in her usual state of health until about two months ago.
On [**2120-5-31**], she suffered an L1 burst fracture and left rib fracture secondary to a fall from a ten foot ladder (per patient) or from a second-floor window (per patient's daughter) at home.
She was evaluated by Psychiatry at that time for possible paranoia and questionable suicidal ideation postoperatively.
Medical workup at that time included a negative RPR, normal thyroid function tests, and a head MRI showing possible chronic microvascular ischemia.
She complained of sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath with oxygen saturations dropping to 70%, blood pressure dropping to 70/40.
Progressive loss of bilateral translucency on chest x-ray and positive anti-HLA and anti-granulocyte antibodies on hematological workup were all consistent with TRALI (transfusion-associated lung injury).
While in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, her postoperative course was further complicated with methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, pneumonia, and wound infection (which were documented with positive cultures on [**7-17**]).
After she was started on intravenous oxacillin on [**7-20**], she had very good response, with decreased fever and decreased white blood cell count, as well as clearing of bacteremia which was documented by several blood cultures drawn on later days.
She also underwent incision and drainage of posterior wounds on [**7-23**].
Wound cultures showed decreased colonization of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and rare colonies of E. coli.
She also had a diagnostic pleural tap on [**7-26**] for persistent left pleural effusion.
She had repeated TTE on [**7-22**] which showed no vegetation and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%.
She also had a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis on [**7-25**], which showed improving effusion and normal bowels with old splenic infarct.
CT angio was also performed, which showed improving atelectasis and effusion without evidence of pulmonary emboli.
MEDICATIONS:  Oxacillin, Lopressor, subcutaneous heparin, Zantac, Ativan, Haldol, Colace, Epogen, vitamin D, nasogastric tube feeds  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No apparent distress.
Chest: Well-healed left lateral posterior surgical scar, nontender, no erythema.
Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities:  Warm to touch, no edema or cyanosis.
No calf tenderness.
Skin intact, no rashes.
Wound culture on [**7-23**] showed decreased methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus.
Stool cultures were negative for C. difficile.
Chest x-ray on [**7-26**] showed decreased left pleural effusion without pneumothorax, decreased congestive heart failure, persistent left basilar atelectasis.
CT on [**7-25**] showed an old splenic infarct, no abnormal bowel or liver or fluid collection.
CT angio showed no evidence of pulmonary emboli, increased left pleural effusion, ground-glass attenuation consistent with volume overload.
Pleural tap showed no malignant cells.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  While on the Medical service, she was continued on oxacillin and showed improvement with decreased white blood cell count and decreased temperature.
Her initial symptoms of tachycardia have also resolved, likely due to a combination of measures including intravenous hydration, improved pulmonary function with incentive spirometer.
Repeated CTA revealed no evidence of pulmonary emboli.
Signs of underlying psychiatric disorder became more obvious.
A head CT revealed age-inappropriate atrophy such as seen in increased risk for dementia.
Psychiatry recommended restarting on Haldol to control psychotic symptoms and continue one-to-one sitter until the patient was no longer at high risk of eloping from the hospital.
The patient's psychotic symptoms improved with gradually increased doses of Haldol.
L1 burst fracture and left rib fracture status post L9 to T3 fusion 2.
Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus wound infection 3.
Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus pneumonia 4.
Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia 5.
