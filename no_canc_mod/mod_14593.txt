She had a stress test done on the [**12-23**] that showed inferior infarct and posterior lateral ischemia with an ejection fraction of 40 percent.
This revealed three-vessel disease and an EF of 50 percent, including the left main 50- 70 percent, LAD 70 percent ostial lesion, left circumflex that was small and totally occluded and an RCA that was also totally occluded.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for congestive heart failure, hypertension, depression, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, mild mental retardation, epilepsy, schizophrenia, senile dementia, osteoarthritis and glaucoma.
Parents and siblings have all passed away.
General:  Lying flat in bed in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1-S2 with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, heard loudest at the base with radiation to the carotids.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities: Warm and well-perfused with no  edema or varicosities.
Posterior tibial two plus on the right and one plus on the left.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Prior to being accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting, the patient was seen by the neurology service and underwent MRI of the head to rule out infarct as well as carotids that showed a narrowing 40 percent on the right and 40 to 59 percent on the left.
However, she had a slight respiratory acidosis and, therefore, remained intubated overnight.
On postoperative day one, the patient was weaned from the ventilator to minimal support; however, prior to extubation, she had no air leak from her cuff.
Additionally, she was begun on beta blockade as well as diuretic therapy.
Following initiation of beta blockade, the patient was noted to have sinus pauses with a heart rate down to the 30's and, therefore, she remained in the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
On the morning of postoperative day four, the patient had no further sinus pauses and she was transferred from the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1-S2 with no murmur.
Incision with Steri-Strips.
No drainage or erythema.
Left leg incision with endoscopic harvest site with Steri-Strips.
CAD status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four    with LIMA to the left anterior descending; saphenous vein    graft to diagonal; saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal    and saphenous vein graft to PDA.
Diabetes mellitus.
Mental retardation.
