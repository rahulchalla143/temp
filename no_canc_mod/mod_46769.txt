Name:  [**Known lastname 5405**],[**Known firstname **]                Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 14415**]  Admission Date:  [**2154-4-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-5-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-4-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11437**] Chief Complaint: Laminectomy/spinal fusision  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L4-5 laminectomy and posterior spinal fusion Intubation Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: 55 year-old woman with persistent lower back pain.
She has significant stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5 with degenerative listhesis at L4-5.
The risks and benefits of a posterior L4 laminectomy with a posterior spinal fusion at L4-5 were discussed with her in detail.
Past Medical History: - Hepatitis C liver cirrhosis - Esophageal varices - Hypertension - S/p cholecystectomy - S/p hysterectomy - S/p appendectomy  Physical Exam: At admission: AVSS Well appearing, NAD, comfortable BUE: SILT C5-T1 dermatomal distributions BUE: [**6-1**] [**Doctor First Name **]/Tri/Bic/WE/WF/FF/IO BUE: tone normal, negative [**Doctor Last Name 14416**], 2+ symmetric DTR bic/bra/tri All fingers WWP, brisk capillary refill, 2+ distal pulses BLE: decreased sensation in L5 distr.
Otherwise SILT L1-S1 dermatomal distributions BLE: [**6-1**] IP/Qu/HS/TA/GS/[**Last Name (un) **]/FHL/Per BLE: tone normal, no clonus, toes downgoing, 2+ DTR knee/ankle All toes WWP, brisk capillary refill, 2+ distal pulses  At discharge: VS: T 99.2, BP 102/50, HR 57, RR 18, O2 95% on 1 liter O2 GENERAL: NAD, breathing comfortably CV: RRR CHEST: Good breath sounds throughout, mild crackles at the bases, no rhonchi or wheezing ABDOMEN: soft, nontender, nondistended NEURO: Alert, oriented x3, attentive PSYCH: Calm, appropriate  Pertinent Results: ECHO [**4-30**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Bilateral, extensive ground-glass and reticular opacities are present with some geographically spared areas.
In addition, foci of predominantly dependent consolidation are present, mostly in the left lower lobe.
Bilateral pleural effusions are minimal.
MEDIASTINUM: Few borderline sized lymph nodes measuring up to 11 mm are present in the lower paratracheal, precarinal, and subcarinal regions.
No pathologically enlarged supraclavicular or axillary lymph nodes.
The main pulmonary artery before bifurcation measures up to 34 mm, suggestive of mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
Atherosclerotic calcification involving coronary arteries is severe, distributed along the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries.
Low density cardiac contents suggest anemia.
The heart is normal size and there is no pericardial abnormality.
ABDOMEN: This study is not designed for assessment of subdiaphragmatic pathologies; however, limited views revealed surface irregularity and heterogeneity of the liver, multiple perigastric and perisplenic collateral vessels and mild ascites distributed in the perihepatic region which consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension (known cirrhosis per clinical history).
BONES: There is no bone lesion concerning for malignancy or infection.
Bilateral, diffuse, ground-glass and reticular opacities, and dependent foci of consolidation.
Concurrent infection is also possible Differential diagnosis is broad and includes hydrostatic edema and diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage.
Cirrhosis with portal hypertension.
Reversal of directionality (hepatofugal) of portal and splenic veins with xtensive splenorenal shunting in the setting of a cirrhotic liver.
Small amount of ascites in the right upper and bilateral lower quadrants.
Refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The surgery was without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition.
An IJ central line was placed in OR given poor IV access.
Line discontinued day of discharge without incident.
TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.
Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA.
Patient was transfused with 3 units of PRBC for blood loss anemia.
On day of anticipated discharge on [**4-27**], pt was noted to have low grade fevers and hypoxia.
A chest XRAY at that point was concerning for pneumonia with pulmonary edema, and she was noted to have a Hafina alvei UTI.
She remained on the orthopedic floor but had persistent issues with hypoxia and volume overload.
On [**5-1**] she became more short of breath with hypoxia at rest.
The medicine consult service recommended further diuresis (received a totoal of 90mg IV lasix over he course of the morning) without good urine output or symptomatic improvement.
MICU COURSE:  # Respiratory Failure:  Combination of HCAP and pulmonary edema.
Etiology of pulmonary edema not entirely clear, but could be related to her underlying cirrhosis.
Echo showed some mild pulmonary hypertension but no other major abnormalities.
Chest CT also appeared consistent with ARDS picture.
She was started on BiPAP for ventilatory support but her work of breathing persisted and given her diffuse infiltrates on imaging she was intubated on [**5-4**].
She also underwent bedside bronchoscopy in the ICU which was without any obvious abnormality and her BAL was negative.
Given her aggressive diuresis on the lasix ggt, she also developed problems with hypotension requiring levophed support and the lasix gtt was stopped on [**5-4**].
She subsequently developed ATN presumed secondary to her hypotensive episodes with Cr peaking at 3.2.
She completed an 8 day course of vanc/cefepime for HCAP and 5 day course of azithromycin.
# Renal Failure: Pt with Cr peaking at 3.1.
Urine was spun and seemed consistent with ATN in setting of her hypotensive episodes.
Thoght to be due to overdiuresis and poor PO intake.
# Hafina alvei UTI:  Completed course of cefepime.
# Anxiety:  On sertraline  # Abdominal pain: Unclear etiology but appears to have been going on for a while.
# EtOH/HCV Cirrhosis:  PCP reportedly following cirrhosis which is [**2-28**] ETOH.
Never had EtOH withdrawal seizures or DTs.
Has never had a liver biopsy but has had a RUQ U/S, though PCP has no record of this.
Pt with some asterixis on exam in MICU.
She will need close liver follow up  # Chronic LBP s/p L4-L5 laminectomy with posterior spinal fusion.
12. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: [**1-28**]  Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
13. oxycodone 5 mg Capsule Sig: [**1-28**] Capsules PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 7 days.

You were admitted for a spinal surgery which was performed without complication.
Your hospital course was complicated by a pneumonia and fluid in your lungs for which you were treated in the intensive care unit.
