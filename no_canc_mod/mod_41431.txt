Admission Date:  [**2178-12-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2179-1-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2142-1-9**]       Sex:  F   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 36 year old female with a history of adult polycystic disease status post peritoneal dialysis who presented with sudden onset of severe epigastric pain with bilious emesis.
The patient reports no recent changes in peritoneal dialysis and peritoneal fluid was clear.
The patient denied radiation of pain to the back or scapula.
The history of relationship of the pain to the eating was unclear.
The patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, fever or chills.
The patient denied dysuria and patient reports no recent weight losses and no recent changes in her appetite.
She denies diarrhea or constipation.
Heart revealed a regular rhythm, no murmurs appreciated.
No jugulovenous distension.
No peritoneal signs.
No guarding, no rebound and no rigidity.
KUB showed no dilated loops of bowel.
Pneumoperitoneum was consistent with peritoneal dialysis.
Abdominal computerized tomography scan showed free fluid in the abdomen and no retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Liver shows fullness of the pancreas with fluid stranding anterior to the pancreas.
In the right lower lobe there was atelectasis versus pneumonia.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Polycystic kidney disease on the maternal side.
The patient's ascitic fluid grew out pansensitive enterococcus.
The diagnosis of peritonitis in the setting of pancreatitis was unclear, however, because this ascitic fluid grew out enterococcus the patient was presumed to have peritonitis.
Pancreatitis - The patient's amylase and lipase were significantly elevated on admission.
The patient was started on Dilaudid for pain control.
Over the four week course of the hospitalization the patient had very slow to resolve pancreatitis.
Two weeks into the hospitalization the patient had improvement in her pancreatic enzyme levels and her abdominal pain.
She subsequently had nausea and vomiting and increased abdominal pain and increasing Dilaudid requirements.
The patient's Dilaudid requirement ranged from 6 to 14 mg per day.
On [**12-16**], the patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed a 1.2 cm common bile duct, however, no stones were visualized at that time.
On [**1-4**], in response to increased abdominal pain and increasing pancreatic enzymes, the patient had another right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed a hepatic common bile duct measuring 8 mm in diameter.
On [**2178-12-23**], in response to increased abdominal pain and increase in Dilaudid requirement, the patient had right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed a common bile duct of 6.5 mm with no stones visualized.
On [**1-17**], the patient had MRCP which showed mild smooth tapered dilatation of the common bile duct without evidence of cholelithiasis or extrinsic cause of narrowing.
The region of the ampulla at the common bile duct was not well visualized due to metallic artifact from surgical clips.
There were dilated sidebranches to the hepatic duct, likely to be a sequelae from previous episodes of inflammation.
There were multiple simple cysts of the liver consistent with diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease.
On [**1-4**], the patient had abdominal computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis which showed moderate fracturing of the tail of the pancreas with no discrete abscess or fluid collection.
There was a moderate amount of free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis consistent with history of peritoneal dialysis.
In summary, the patient was believed to have slow to resolved pancreatitis in the setting of chronic renal failure.
The plan was conservative management with pain medication, NPO and fluids as necessary.
Neurological - The patient has a history of seizures and was on Dilantin prior to admission.
On hospital day #2 the patient was found hypotensive and lethargic.
The patient was coded and had a seizure and subsequently became unresponsive.
Renal - The patient has a history of adult polycystic kidney disease, status post cadaveric renal transplant with chronic rejection.
Since [**2178-10-19**] the patient had not had any previous episodes of peritonitis.
When the patient was on peritoneal dialysis prior to the renal transplant the patient had multiple episodes of peritonitis.
Cardiovascular - The patient had a longstanding history of hypertension which was difficult to control during the course of her hospitalization.
She showed no signs of uremia and the renal team felt that the absolute level of BUN was not significant in the absence of uremic signs.
