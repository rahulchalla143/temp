Admission Date:  [**2112-4-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2112-4-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2041-7-25**]       Sex:  F  Service:  GREEN [**Last Name (un) **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70 year old female who presented with a five day history of nausea and vomiting associated with abdominal pain.
The patient was unable to tolerate a liquid diet and complained of constipation on admission.
The patient last had a colonoscopy in [**2110-12-17**] which demonstrated adenomatous polyps in the mid-descending colon.
The patient had one similar episode of nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain that was peristaltic in nature one year prior to presentation which resolved after an enema in the emergency room.
The patient otherwise denied chest pain, dysuria, melena, hematochezia or any other symptoms.
She did complain of occasional shortness of breath.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 50 percent.
Low anterior resection in [**2108**].
Left femoral endarterectomy Dacron angioplasty.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient was a well-developed, well-nourished, Caucasian female in no acute distress.
Neck supple, midline, no lymphadenopathy or tenderness.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen soft, tender in the left lower quadrant mostly, but evidence of diffuse tenderness.
No masses, no organomegaly.
Rectal positive stool, guaiac positive, no masses.
Extremities warm and well perfused, no edema, nontender.
KUB showed dilated small bowel with positive air fluid levels.
CT angiogram previously ordered by patient's pulmonologist showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus, but an enlarged gallbladder.
EKG ST depressions in leads V5 to V6, biphasic T waves in V2 and V3, normal sinus rhythm at 84 beats per minute with normal axis.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 70 year old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, asthma, hypothyroidism and adenocarcinoma of the rectum, who presents with nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and the presence of air fluid levels on KUB.
The admitting diagnosis was potential small bowel obstruction.
The patient was admitted to the surgery service with the admitting diagnosis of possible small bowel obstruction.
Due to her clinical lack of improvement the patient was taken to the operating room on [**2112-4-12**] where she underwent exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions for high grade small bowel obstruction.
The surgery itself was uncomplicated and she had minimal blood loss.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by hypotension post-op as well as congestive heart failure.
She subsequently developed congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation which were treated with IV furosemide and IV amiodarone for rate control and she converted to normal sinus rhythm.
She diuresed well with furosemide, but due to her persistent respiratory distress and increasing oxygen requirements, she was transferred to the MICU for further, more careful monitoring.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was also complicated by fever which reached a maximum temperature of 101.8 on [**4-12**].
She also had anemia with hematocrit of 27 for which she received one unit of packed red blood cells.
At one point Lasix was held due to episodes of hypotension.
Again, hypotension responded to fluids and Lasix was restarted without incident.
There was also focal right ventricular hypokinesis with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The patient had repeat chest x-ray which showed interval improvement in her congestive heart failure.
Her pain was well controlled with oral pain medications.
She did develop loose stools at one point, but Clostridium difficile toxin was negative.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
