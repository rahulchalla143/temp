He has a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia and non insulin dependent diabetes.
He was diagnosed with a right thalamic stroke in [**2124-2-1**] with a left carotid stenosis.
Echo at the time revealed an LVEF of 45% with mild global hypokinesis.
Subsequent ETT revealed evidence of an inferior MI with mild ischemia, LVEF 30-35%.
He was referred previously to [**Hospital1 18**] for left heart catheterization which revealed 3 vessel disease.
He reports that he has had intermittent chest pain over the past three weeks.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Non insulin dependent diabetes Prior silent MI by ETT [**2124-2-27**]: right thalamic stroke with left hemiparesis, treated at [**Hospital1 2025**].

There is 40% stenosis in the right ICA and 40-59% stenosis in the left ICA.
Mild heterogeneous plaque in the left ICA and minimal amount of plaque in the right carotid bulb.
[**2124-8-9**] ECHO Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=35%).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No appreciable supra-annular calcification in minimally dilated, ascending thoracic aorta.
Severe coronary arterial calcifications.

A carotid duplex ultrasound was obtained which revealed a 40-59% stenosis in the left internal carotid artery and mild disease in the right.
A CT scan showed no significant intracranial process, no appreciable supra-annular calcification in minimally dilated, ascending thoracic aorta and 4mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe warrants CT reevaluation in 12 months.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD #6 the patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
