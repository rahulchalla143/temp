There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area ,0.5 cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS: LV systolic function is slightly improved.
RV systolic function remians normal.
There is mild peri-valvular AI.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
All narcotics were stopped due to lethargy and she was on Tylenol only for pain at the time of discharge and oriented x 3.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
