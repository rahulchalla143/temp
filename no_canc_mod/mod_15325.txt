Admission Date:  [**2147-2-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2147-2-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2068-3-18**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical problems who comes to us from [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 34648**] for respiratory distress and hypotension.
She has been on a tracheostomy since [**2146-9-28**] when she had a coronary artery bypass graft at an outside hospital and had failure to wean.
She was transferred to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation for ventilatory weaning and was given the diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia and had two stents placed in the distal trachea and left main stent.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass graft in [**2146-9-28**] at [**Hospital6 1708**].
Congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 30%); per [**Hospital1 **] notes.
History of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermitis bacteremia and sepsis; status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Atrial fibrillation; status post coronary artery bypass graft.
A recent diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia with placement of silicon stents.
Peripheral vascular disease; status post aortic femoral bypass.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Peptic ulcer disease; status post a total gastrectomy.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Abdominal hernia repair.
There were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.
Lungs prior to the urgent bronchoscopy revealed decreased air movement on the right with minimal breath sounds on the left.
The abdomen was soft, slight distended, with no hepatosplenomegaly.
There was a vertical scar.
Extremity examination revealed extremities which were cool distally with dopplerable distal pulses.
No edema or clubbing.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed hyperinflation on the right with left main stem with discrete cutoff prior to the bronchoscopy.
An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with no acute ischemic changes.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient had respiratory failure that was thought to be secondary to mucous bronchial plugging as well as pneumonia.
Subsequently, sputum cultures grew out Klebsiella and Serratia which were sensitive to ceftriaxone.
Given the fact that we had a source of Serratia and Klebsiella in the sputum with no evidence of positive blood cultures, linezolid was discontinued.
HYPOTENSION/SHOCK ISSUES:  Initially, the patient came to us with a low blood pressure with required a Levophed drip to be maintained.
An echocardiogram was performed which showed an ejection fraction of 25% to 30% with 3+ mitral regurgitation and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
The source of her hypotension was thought to be two-fold; one cardiogenic and the second reason was thought to be related to septicemia.
With treatment of her pneumonia with antibiotics as well as initiation of digoxin, she has been able to maintain her blood pressures adequately without the need for pressors.
At times the patient was very agitated during examination but was able to be calmed with verbal preparation.
