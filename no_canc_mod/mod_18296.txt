Admission Date:  [**2123-10-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2123-10-14**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and questionable colon cancer who has been ill for months.
The patient has been having multiple syncopal episodes at home times months.
She experienced fracture of left arm and right arm during falls.
A colonoscopy with multiple polyps; unclear if cancer or not.
Had delirium and a 5[**Hospital 15386**] hospital course there.
Last week, she was treated with ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
Chronic renal failure.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed jugular venous pressure was flat.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Responded minimally to voice.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Bedside echocardiogram revealed no wall motion abnormalities, normal ejection fraction, no valvular abnormalities.
An electrocardiogram at the outside hospital showed sinus bradycardia at 33, left axis deviation, T wave inversions in III.
Presumably at the time of presentation we thought that the patient might have been septic as her numbers were more consistent with a septic physiology as opposed to a cardiogenic shock physiology.
The patient had an elevated white blood cell count and a left shift.
She was hypothermic and had evidence of a recent urinary tract infection for which she was being treated.
However, we could not completely exclude a myocardial infarction given recent ongoing myocardial infarction; although less likely.
Other things on our differential that we were including were adrenal insufficiency and hypothermia with which she presented.
A sepsis workup was sent off which included blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum culture.
A chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe collapse and questionable consolidation.
No evidence of congestive heart failure; thus bringing the likelihood that the patient was in cardiogenic shock.
Despite one pressor, the patient required pressors for blood pressure support.
A conversation with the family was held, and it was their wishes that the patient not any have further aggressive measures or attempts of resuscitation such as pacing, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or cardioversion.
Despite out continued efforts in attempts to stabilize the patient and wean off pressors, the patient was not going to be able to tolerate being off mechanical ventilation or pressor support.
HYPOTHERMIA ISSUES:  Likely secondary to sepsis.
BRADYCARDIA ISSUES:  At outside hospital, the patient was recorded as having sinus bradycardia up to 33.
Most likely secondary to ischemia and consequent hypothermia.
NON-ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION ISSUES:  It was likely that the patient had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction secondary to demand given her hypotension.
Given the patient's elevated cardiac enzymes with a troponin of 0.15 in the setting of renal insufficiency, the troponin leak was attributed to demand ischemia and not acute coronary syndrome.
CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient's baseline creatinine was unknown, but chronic renal insufficiency may have been attributed to hypotension or rheumatoid arthritis.
ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient's hematocrit was followed on a daily basis.
Her hematocrit dropped secondary to large intravenous fluid hydration and volume given.
No evidence of acute blood loss noted on examination.
Likely etiology was hypoglycemic seizure.
ACCESS ISSUES:  The patient had a right internal jugular and left arterial line placed on [**10-12**].
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
Chronic renal failure.
