Since this test was done on an outpatient specimen which was sent to a third-party laboratory, it was unclear whether this result represented laboratory artifact or the true presence of metabolic acidosis.
These included being sent to the [**Hospital3 7632**] Emergency Room for evaluation and repeat of laboratory testing with subsequent admission to [**Hospital3 7632**] or to the [**Hospital1 536**] Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for retesting and subsequent admission if need be based on the results of testing.
In a recent phone call to the parents, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with them, have created a plan that repeated laboratory testing would be done here at [**Hospital1 960**] and if abnormalities were to be noted that [**Known lastname **] would be transferred to [**Hospital6 7633**].
