Admission Date:  [**2176-7-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2176-7-23**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of hypertension, catheterization ten years ago complicated by intracranial bleed, and a 120 pack-year smoking history, who developed the acute onset of substernal chest pain with shortness of breath, nausea, and diaphoresis on the day of admission.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 3583**] where he was found to have ST elevations in electrocardiogram leads V2-V6, I, II, and AVF.
On catheterization, he had elevated filling pressures with pulmonary artery systolic of 37, diastolic of 21, and mean of 29.
He was found to have right dominance.
Left circumflex had no disease.
The mid LAD lesion was stented with mild impingement of D1 at the origin.
Integrilin was deferred secondary to history of hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident.
He was in no acute distress.
He was pain free.
HEENT:  There was no jugular venous distention present.
There was a 1 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur.
No discomfort or hematoma in groin.
No edema present.
Electrocardiogram on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm at 88 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals, marked ST elevation in the anterior precordium, V2-V6, lead I, II, and AVF.
After stenting, there was partially normalizing of the ST elevations, new Q-waves and loss of R-wave in V2 and V3.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and ruled in for myocardial infarction by enzymes and by electrocardiogram.
Lopressor was added because of beta-blocker favorable affects on mortality.
The patient developed hemoptysis with brown sputum, slightly blood tinged on day #2 of admission.
An abdominal CT scan was also done which was negative for intra-abdominal abscess; however, it did reveal right middle lobe pneumonia which had also been seen on earlier chest x-rays.
Also urinalysis revealed probably urinary tract infection which was felt to be treated on the Levaquin, and an electrocardiogram revealed possible V5 ST elevation, which would have been a new finding compared with previous electrocardiograms.
However, because of a lack of increase in the CK or the CKMB fraction, this was felt to be noncontributory.
