HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease.
The patient presented with substernal chest pain to [**Hospital1 536**] on [**2121-9-22**].
The patient was found subsequently to rule in for an acute myocardial infarction with troponin I levels peaking at greater than 50.
Cardiac catheterization showed severe three-vessel disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes mellitus currently treated with Insulin.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to ASPIRIN and PENICILLIN, both of which give the patient hives.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a family history with a brother, who has coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction at the age of 40.
GENERAL:  The patient is alert, mildly tachypneic, in no acute distress.
CHEST:  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles or wheezes.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular, normal S1 and S2; no murmurs appreciated.
ABDOMEN: Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended; no masses or hepatosplenomegaly noted.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally; no edema.
RECTAL:  Rectal examination showed trace-positive guaiac.
He underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed severe three-vessel disease with a preserved ejection fraction of 50%.
Of note, the patient's preoperative testing revealed mildly elevated LFTs of unknown etiology.
The preoperative pulmonary function tests also showed moderate to severe restrictive pattern, again, of unknown etiology.
Postoperatively, the patient's course was complicated initially by respiratory failure requiring re-intubation, initially thought to be secondary to upper-airway edema.
However, he continued to have respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
The patient, at that time, was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Imipenem and Levaquin.
The patient also had CAT scan of the chest, as per the Pulmonary Service, which showed diffuse interstitial changes with ground-glass appearance and areas of alveolar filling process, especially in the left upper lobe.
Of note, the patient's cytology from his BAL came back showing atypical cells worrisome for small cell lung cancer.
As the patient's LFTs worsened, he became somewhat coagulopathic and manifested an upper GI bled with bloody NG-tube drainage, requiring transfusion of several units of packed red cells.
The patient underwent a repeat echocardiogram, which showed severe hypokinesis.
The patient also had periods of hypotension requiring Neo-Synephrine drip.
The patient also began to manifest signs of acute renal failure with worsening creatinine.
The patient maintained his electrolytes and never became acidotic and continued to make urine, such that volume overload was not an issue.
Multiple sets of cultures were sent including cultures from previous bronchoscopy, blood cultures, and urine cultures.
These were sent for bacteria, fungus, and AFB.
After evaluating the patient, it was unclear as to the cause of the etiology of the patient's elevated LFTs.
Again, in light of the patient's increased LFTs, a right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained, which was worrisome for a calculus cholecystitis.
However, the acute renal failure slowly improved and his LFTs returned close to baseline.
The patient underwent two more bronchoscopies, again, with some suctioning of some thick secretions.
Sputum culture was sent after the nurse noted increased frequency of suctioning, which grew MRSA.
The patient was started on Vancomycin to treat the MRSA pneumonia for a 14-day course.
Severe three-vessel coronary artery disease status post CABG times five, complicated by multi-organ system dysfunction with acute renal failure, ARDS and acute hepatic failure.
