The patient was discharged [**4-19**] with a discharge status of delirium with visual hallucinations and short term confusion who presented to rehab and was immediately sent back to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern of mental status.
A code stroke was called due to confusion and slight assymetry on face.
The CCU team and neurology evaluated the patient and thought consistent with delirium and prior deficits from CVAs.
CT head was done and was negative for acute intracranial process (on prelim read).
CXR with edema but no infiltrate.
He denies any pain or shortness of breath.

The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with generalized atrophy.
There is a large area of encephalomalacia in the right occipital lobe, unchanged from prior CT.  Old right lenticular lacune is noted.
There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema.
Persistent left basilar opacification, but somewhat improved.
Brief Hospital Course: 80-year-old male with history of CAD s/p CABG x2, chronic systolic heart failure with EF of 25%, s/p BiV pacemaker with very recent admission with cellulitis complicated by renal failure and HD inititiation, PEA arrest, with resultant short term memory loss and delirium who presented from rehab with delirium with concern of sepsis with urinary tract infection.
# Altered mental status: There were likely multiple etiologies including anoxic brain injury, delirium and possible infection.
The anoxic brain injury is not treatable at this time.
The patient remained afebrile during his hospitalization.
Head CT and CXR did not show any acute proscess.
There was evidence of old occipital infarcts.
Delirium continued to worsen in the context of hypotension associated with hemodialysis and then worsening metabolic state after HD was discontinued.
Patient had a history of requiring substantial preload and gentle IVF was provided prn to maintain volume status.
# CAD: s/p CABG.
# Systolic CHF: Breathing on room air at time of admission, but oxygen requirement increased over the course of the admission.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed an increasing oxygen requirement, initially by nasal cannula, then face mask, as secretions worsened.
# h/o CVA: Per neuro consult note recommend warfarin for INR >2.
However due to concern for risk of falls or bleeding, we increased aspirin to 325mg and started him on a statin to minimize future strokes.
# Renal failure: Admitted on HD, which caused hypotension and may have contributed to low volume status exacerbating delirium.
# Nutrition: Patient was tolerating POs at time of admission, but his PO intake decreased as his delirium worsened.
