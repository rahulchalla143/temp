Admission Date:  [**2101-11-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2101-12-7**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old male with a past medical history significant for pulmonary embolism in the past, as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, meniere's disease, and increasing "memory loss" who presents from an outside hospital after having a left arm shaking at home, and then having dysarthria and rapidly declining mental status requiring intubation.
On head CT, he had a right frontal parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he was soon extubated, but then had another episode of mental status change and was found to have pneumonia.
On exam, he has a left hemiplegia and left neglect, but is responsive and following commands.
He was later found to be in acute respiratory distress after being called out to the floor initially and he subsequently returned to the Intensive Care Unit for reintubation and then was again transferred to the floor on [**2101-11-28**] after being stabilized.
He continued to have a rather high oxygen requirement on initial call out, however, this was eventually resolved.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Pulmonary embolism 12 years ago in the setting of total hip replacement, status post IVC filter and "mild memory loss" according to the family.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Zosyn for the pneumonia which he received a 14 day course of and stopped.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of aneurysm or stroke.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile with blood pressures 138/70.
The patient has also left-sided hemiplegia with a left-sided facial droop and left arm and leg have 0/5 strength.
He has a left upgoing toe and withdraws to pain bilaterally in his extremities.
Urine culture from [**11-28**] showed no growth.
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure and no pneumothorax.
CT showed as mentioned, a large right frontal parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with some leftward shift to the septum lucidum, no uncle herniation and also small amounts of hemorrhage in the dependent portions of the occipital horns bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Neurology Service with an acute large right intraparenchymal hemorrhage and severe left-sided hemiplegia with left-sided neglect.
It was felt that his hemorrhage was likely due to amyloid, although, the patient was on Coumadin also at the time.
Given his diagnosis of probable amyloid angiopathy, he is not an optimal long-term Coumadin candidate.
The patient did well throughout admission after resolution of his pneumonia.
He had no further temperature spikes.
Follow-up with his PCP and Cardiology to be scheduled as well to optimize management of his atrial fibrillation.
