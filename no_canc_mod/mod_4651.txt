CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-7-15**] 9:53 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: eval for hemorrhage  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 81 year old woman with found unresponsive.
Evaluate for acute intracranial hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Areas of encephalomalacia within the parietooccipital region on the right appears to have progressed when compared to the prior examination of [**2180-8-6**].
There is local atrophy with enlargement of sulci.
These findings suggest interval infarction since [**7-12**], but not acute.
There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci consistent with mild atrophy.
Bone windows show clear paranasal sinuses with no evidence of fracture.
IMPRESSION: Encephalomalacia and surrounding hypoattenuation within the right parietoocipital lobe which appears to have increased when compared to [**2180-8-6**].
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
An MRI/MRA would be helpful in evaluating for acute infarction in this setting if clinically warranted.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for AAA or other pathology CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: An 81-year-old female found responsive with abdominal distention.
No studies are available for comparison.
The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber with no evidence of aneurysm or dissection within the visualized portion of the aorta.
There is an 8 mm rounded low-attenuation lesion within the mid- pole of the left kidney that cannot be further characterized on this study performed with a single phase of contrast enhancement that likely represents a simple renal cyst.
There is no dilatation or wall thickening within the large and small bowel.
Several prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen in the aortocaval region seen best on series 3, image 24, measuring 1.7 x 0.6 mm.
There is a left hip prosthesis in place.
REFORMATTED IMAGING: Images reformatted in the coronal and sagittal planes were essential in evaluating the patient's abdomen and show no evidence of dilatation or wall thickening without large and small bowel.
No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Small amount of free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis.
An 8 mm low-attenuation lesion within the left kidney likely representing a simple cyst.

No intraluminal thrombus was identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombus in the right lower extremity.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]   FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: A diffusely slowed posterior and anterior background was seen with maximal 5.5 Hz posterior rhythms of moderate voltage and equal amounts of mixed frequency delta seen both anteriorly and posteriorly.
No frank epileptiform abnormalities were noted.
SLEEP: The patient drowsed but failed to enter stage II sleep.
No new abnormalities were noted.
CARDIAC MONITOR: No arrythmias noted.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to diffusely slowed and disorganized rhythms overall with focal accentuation in the right temporal region broadly.
INTERPRETED BY: [**Last Name (LF) 96**],[**First Name3 (LF) 125**] H.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old female with history of stroke and altered mental status.
FINDINGS:  There are new bilateral 5mm hypodensities seen at the medial dorsal thalamus not previously appreciated on [**2182-7-15**] examination.
Although these lesions are mildly asymmetric they are atypical for appearance of thalamic lacunar infarctions.
These lesions may be seen in a setting of Wernicke's encephalopathy or Behcet's disease.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Encephalomalacia in the right parieto-occipital region is stable and compatible with the previous infarction.
Sulcal prominence noted suggestive of involutional changes.
Mildly asymmetric hypodensities seen at the dorsal medial thalamus.
These findings may be seen in the setting of Wernicke's encephalopathy or Behcet's disease.
These lesions may also represent thalamic lacunar infarctions although the bilateral distribution is somewhat atypical.
Right parieto-occipital lobe encephalomalacia from previous infarction without interval change.
AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.

RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: 2D, color and Doppler wave forms were obtained of the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, basilic and brachial veins.
No intraluminal thrombus was seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
On [**7-17**], she was noted to have a LLL opacity on CXR.
She was started on a 10 d course of Levo/Flagyl for treatment of an aspiration pneumonia.
2) Altered mental status: Initial neurologic examination was clouded by sedating meds that had been administered.
The patient had extensive work-up for her altered mental status, including a lumbar puncture, head CT, and EEG.
The patient could not have an MRI due to her pacemaker.
Lumbar puncture did not show evidence of meningitis.
Review of CT head imaging disclosed evidence for bilateral thalamic strokes, likely secondary to emboli (given pt's atrial fibrillation).
The patient is maintained on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
3) Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and sick sinus syndrome, s/p pacemaker placement.
The patient does not take Coumadin due to history of falls.
At that time, she did not show any evidence of aspiration.
6) R UE swelling: There was concern for possible DVT in patient's RUE.
