Admission Date:  [**2143-7-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-7-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-5-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**] Chief Complaint: Fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram  History of Present Illness: 62 year old man with CAD in [**2138**] s/p RCA stenting, depression, and alcoholism who was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2143-7-24**] after a witnessed fall down stairs while intoxicated.
CT findings demonstrated a subarachnoid and left parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Patient was also found to have alcohol withdrawl and thrombocytopenia.
CT torso showed emphysema and a 5mm RLL nodule, fatty liver, soft plaque in the descending aorta causing 40% stenosis, 50% stenosis of the right common iliac artery.
Hematology was consulted for thrombocytopenia who felt that it was most likely secondary to bone marrow suppression.
The patient was transferred to medicine for further managment of his thrombocytopenia and alcohol withdrawl.
Past Medical History:  - MI s/p cardiac catheterization and stenting, [**2138**]  - HTN - Alcohol abuse - Hx anterior cervical spinal fusion   Social History: EtOH abuse, 40 pack year smoking history  Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death, DM, HTN.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
LUNGS: CTAB, no W/R/R HEART: RRR, normal S1 S2, no MRG ABDOMEN: Soft, NT, NABS, no organomegaly, no ascites EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e, extemities wasted NEUROLOGIC: A+OX3, no tremor or asterixis.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right sylvian fissure and suprasellar cistern.
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe in the vertex and tiny punctate focus in the body of the right corpus callosum.
[**7-23**] chest Xray: The lungs are well expanded and show a left lower lobe mild patchy opacity, likely Atelectasis.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
No displaced rib fractures are noted.
[**7-23**] CT Cervical Spine: No acute fracture or malalignment.
As above, there is no acute abnormality.
However, there is circumferential lucency about the paired screws in the C5 and C6, but no the C4 vertebral body, and, in the absence of previous studies, loosening is a consideration.
Also noted is significant bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at the C5/6 and C6/7 levels, with possible exiting neural impingement.
No acute fracture.
Mild stranding in the subcutaneous tissues overlying the left gluteal muscles.
5-mm right lower lobe nodule needs followup in 12 months if the patient is low risk for malignancy and followup CT in six months if the patient is high risk for malignancy.
Diffuse calcific and non-calcific plaque causing 40% narrowing of the distal descending thoracic aorta, 50% stenosis of the celiac artery and 50% stenosis of the right common iliac artery.
Slight increase in size of the small parenchymal hemorrhage at the left pareitovertex [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction.
No significant short-interval change in the amount or distribution of the subarachnoid hemorrhage, predominantly in the right basal cisterns.
[**7-24**] Cerebral angiogram No aneurysm no apparent etiology to subarachnoid and parenchymal hemorrhage.
Incidental notes include an infundibulum at the origin of the left posterior communicating artery.
[**7-25**] CT head: stable hemorrhages, note made of left frontoparietal subdural hygroma  DISCHARGE LABS:  [**2143-7-30**] 07:40AM BLOOD WBC-6.3 RBC-3.88* Hgb-13.3* Hct-39.4* MCV-102* MCH-34.2* MCHC-33.7 RDW-15.3 Plt Ct-195# [**2143-7-30**] 07:40AM BLOOD Glucose-107* UreaN-14 Creat-0.7 Na-141 K-3.8 Cl-102 HCO3-26 AnGap-17 [**2143-7-28**] 08:10AM BLOOD ALT-55* AST-43* [**2143-7-30**] 07:40AM BLOOD Calcium-9.5 Phos-4.6* Mg-1.6 [**2143-7-25**] 02:07PM BLOOD calTIBC-212* VitB12-567 Folate-GREATER TH Hapto-24* Ferritn-1759* TRF-163*   Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **]  is a 62-year-old man with CAD in [**2138**] s/p RCA stenting, depression, and alcoholism who was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2143-7-24**] after a witnessed fall down stairs, developing a subarachnoid and left parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Intracranial bleed: Patient sustained but a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and a left parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage during his fall.
His left parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage remained stable on CT and his neuro exam remained non-focal.
Patient was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
Thrombocytopenia: Patient was noted to have low platelets, with initial values in the 60's and a nadir in the low 40's.
Heparin-based products were held and patient received pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
Hematology was consulted who determined the thrombocytopenia was most likely secondary to bone marrow suppression secondary to alcohol use.
The patient did not have signs of cirrhosis.
His platelets trended up to 120's upon discharge without intervention, and he was counseled extensively on alcohol cessation and the risk of recurrent bone marrow suppression should he continue to drink.
Upon transfer to medicine, patient was no longer exhibiting signs of withdrawl.
This finding was followed up with lateral c-spine flexion and extension x-rays, which showed minimal lucency around the screws of C6, which might represent some loosening.
Otherwise, moderate degenerative changes more pronounced at C6-C7, but no fracture, malalignment or dynamic instability.
Recommended follow-up CT in 6 months for high risk patients.
Depression: Patient was continued on escitalopram  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Monitor for new neurological deficits and follow up head CT to ensure improvement - Trend platelets - Follow up alcohol cessation - Follow-up CT for incidental 5mm RLL lung nodule in 6 months - Continue to monitor for signs of instability at anterior cervical fusion site  Medications on Admission: .
As you know, you were admitted for a bleed in your brain after having a fall in the setting of alcohol intoxication.
You were also found to have low platelets, which resolved and which were most likely due to your alcohol use.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
You have been prescribed Keppra for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed.
Call your doctor immediately for: -	New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
You had a lung nodule on your CT scan (5-mm right lower lobe nodule) and should have follow up CT scan in 6 months.
If you have any problems booking this appointment, please ask for [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16367**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16368**].
