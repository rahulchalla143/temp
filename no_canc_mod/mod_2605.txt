# Diabetic Ketoacidosis due to gastroparesis: in setting of anion gap acidosis (AG 28) with moderate acetone and FS > 400; all consistent with DKA in setting of gastroparesis and longstanding IDDM.
Was placed on an insulin drip until her anion gap closed on [**2150-5-20**].
She was then continued on an insulin gtt for an additional 24 hours given poor oral intake.
No etiology beyond a known history of gastroparesis was found for her current presentation.
There was consideration for EGD with Botox injections, but this will be pursued as an outpatient with her GI physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
# Anion gap acidosis: likely related to DKA, lactate elevated to 3.7 on admission.
Potassium was monitored closely and repleated as needed and lactic acidosis resolved to 1.0 on discharge.
# Nausea/vomiting: consistent with DKA in setting of gastroparesis and longstanding DM.
Also, during this admission, there was witnessed induction of vomiting and concern for intentional coughing triggering post-tussive emesis for which patient met with SW (see below).
