Admission Date:  [**2105-5-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-5-11**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac cath  History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of NSTEMI in [**2101**] (no cath or stents), moderate AS (AoVA 0.8-1.19cm2 on TTE in [**2101**]), HTN, COPD/emphysema transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for cardiac catheterization after having been worked up for CP x2 days and found to have an NSTEMI.
The patient does not recall having had chest pain ever in the past (despite a h/o MI and having been on Nitro SL prn).
Last Thursday, she was visited by her cousins and developed 60 min lasting midsternal, pressure-like chest pain (w/o radiation) that night.
Of note, she has noticed bilateral ankle edema for about one week.
In addition, she had been short of breath on mild exertion for about one year.
She notes SOB after having walked from her bedroom to her kitchen.
She denies any orthopnea or PND.
Also no aggravation of SOB over the last week although her ankle edema developed since then.
She was found to have an NSTEMI with peak troponin of 0.94.
CXR was without any acute findings at the time of admission.
She had four more episodes of chest pain (twice yesterday and twice today) which were managed with IV Lopressor, IV morphine and IV nitroglycerin with occasional BP drops on higher doses of nitro.
Her last episode of CP was associated with radiation to the right of her lower chest.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for chronic dry cough (secondary to emphysema per patient).
Denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems positive for CP, SOB and ankle edema as above.
Negative for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Ext: No clubbing or cyanosis.
Trace ankle edema (R>L) Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
EKG at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] showed also a PR prolongation of about 240, similar TWIs in anterolateral leads and one ST elevation in V2 (less than 1 mm).
MV leaflets mildly thickened.
No pericardial effusion.
CXR: [**2105-5-1**] at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Admission CXR at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] also without any acute findings (prelim read).
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed two vessel disease.
The LMCA had mild plaquing but no critical stenoses.
The LCx had mild diffuse disease.
The mid LAD lesion was predilated with 1.5 mm, 2.0 mm and 2.5 mm balloons, stented with 2.5 mm and a 3.0 mm bare metal stents and post dilated with a 3.0 mm balloon with lesion reduction from 90 to 0%.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection and no embolisation.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior wall and apex.
There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments.
No intraventricuclar thrombus is seen.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets and supporting structurs are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a prominent, partially echo-filled anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis.
Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional left and right ventricular systolic dysfunction and severely depressed overall systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Severe pulmonary systolic hypertension.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Blood cx [**5-7**]: 4/4 bottles positive MRSA Blood cx [**5-9**]: 1/4 bottles postive for GPC, awaiting speciation Blood cx [**5-11**]: NGTD Urine cx [**5-7**]: Negative   Brief Hospital Course: This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of NSTEMI in [**2101**] (no cath or stents), moderate AS (AoVA 0.8-1.19cm2 on TTE in [**2101**]), HTN, COPD/emphysema transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for cardiac catheterization after having been worked up for CP x2 days and found to have an NSTEMI.
A repeat TTE prior cath showed worsening of her AS from moderate to severe (AoVA 0.4cm2).
Course was complicated by MRSA bacteremia and new onset fib with RVR.
1) Ischemia/CAD: s/p small NSTEMI in [**2101**] (no cath or stents).
Transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] after having been diagnosed with NSTEMI (Troponin peaked at 0.94 at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]).
EKG at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] showed also a PR prolongation of about 240, similar TWIs in anterolateral leads and one ST elevation in V2 but less than 1 mm.
Patient was continued on ASA, Plavix (at home qod b/o easy bruising, now increased to qd again).
#) Bacteremia/Sepsis: Patient spiked a fever, had rigors, and became hypotensive despite 1L IVF on [**5-6**].
She was started on Cipro, Flagyl and Vanc for empiric coverage.
A lasix gtt had to be started as she was volume overloaded after 1L IVF complicated by her low EF and severe AS.
She will need a 6-week course of antibiotics to empirically treat her for endocarditis given her severe valavular disease.
Her CBC should be monitored weekly given the risk of pancytopenia.
Likely due to age-related conduction disturbances.
LE edema for one week and DOE for one year.
Systolic murmur on exam consistant with AS.
#) COPD: H/o emphysema secondary to second hand smoking.
#) DM: H/o steroid-induced hyperglycemia in [**2101**].
ARF on [**5-6**] with Cr 2.0 (baseline 1.0), likely prerenal given urinary Na less than 10 and high urine osms.
However, pt became fluid overloaded after 1L IVF during an attempt to treat the prerenal state.
#) PPX: Pneumoboots, bowel regimen, ASA, no PPI needed currently  .
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
