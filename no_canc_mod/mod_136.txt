Apparently patient has an average of six seizures per month, tonic clonic in nature and associated with a 30 minute post ictal state.
In the past two days he has had a total of six seizures already.
The caregiver reports that his seizures usually increase in frequency when there is an associated infection.
He did have one episode of nausea with questionable coffee ground emesis one day prior to admission.
There is no evidence of sick contacts, fever at home, chills, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, pain anywhere, foul smelling urine, urinary frequency, head injury, rhinorrhea, photophobia.
Partial synostosis of the left lambdoid suture with compression of the left occipital lobe and posterior parietal lobe.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Mental retardation.
Recurrent urinary tract infections.
He was awake, did not make any eye contact and was extremely agitated and restless, requiring soft restraints.
Oropharynx was clear, but with poor dentition.
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy, JVD or carotid bruits.
Lungs revealed coarse breath sounds anteriorly bilaterally.
Cardiac exam revealed that he was slightly tachycardiac, S1, S2, normal without appreciable murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Abdomen was soft, nondistended, nontender with normal bowel sounds and no masses.
Extremities displayed multiple areas of ecchymosis on his left lower extremity, but were otherwise unremarkable without evidence of edema, erythema or unusual rashes.
There were no deep tendon reflexes elicited.
Toes were upgoing bilaterally, but there were no signs of clonus.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's leukocytosis and low grade temperature, both blood and urine cultures were drawn.
Repeat chest x-ray was performed on hospital day one and demonstrated left lower lobe atelectasis versus infiltrate.
Given his questionable history of upper GI bleed one day prior to admission, hematocrit was followed closely and remained stable throughout his hospital stay.
As his infection and dehydration were both treated, patient's seizures decreased in frequency and he soon returned to his baseline status.
Pneumonia, aspiration versus community acquired.
