Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
The LAD had a severe diffuse 80% mid lesion that tapered to 90% focally.
The RCA was totally occluded at the level of the ostium with limited ascending aortography showing no evidence of ostium.
Left to right collaterals from LCX and LAD were noted to fill retrogradely to the level of the acute marginal branch.
No evidence of aortic calcifications in this patient scheduled for CABG.
Extensive enlargement of the thyroid gland with potential infarction of the trachea, correlation with ultrasound might be considered on a non-emergency basis.
Intrathoracic component of the thyroid enlargement is noted.
Several pulmonary nodules as described.
Small hiatal hernia.
