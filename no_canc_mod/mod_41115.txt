Patiet was admitted from [**Hospital 38**] Rehab on [**7-14**] for evaluation of acute shortness of breath and found to have have afib with RVR.
During this hospitalization she was found to have a RML and LLL infiltrates on CXR and was treated for a COPD exacerbation initially with IV solumedrol and levaquin though this was transitioned to PO prednisone and Cefazolin after sputum culture grew E coli resistant to levaquin.
During this hospitalization she was also found to have had an acute drop in her HCT per report (but [**Hospital1 **] record has Hct 25.3-29 from [**Date range (1) **]) and found to have a large rectus sheath hematoma on CT ab/pelvis.
She was seen by cardiology during this admission for her afib w/ RVR which was felt to secondary to acute anemia and COPD.
She was discharged on [**7-25**] back to rehab in no respiratory distress and on 2L NC and was immediately readmitted for complaints of transient unresponsiveness, shortness of breath hypoxia.
Troponins were initially elevated at 0.16 (subsequently trended down) with a non-ischemic appearing EKG by report.
A CT abdomen was performed (no RUQ US) and showed known gallstones without a distended gallbladder or inflammatory changes to suggest acute cholecystitis.
The common duct measured between 8 and 10 mm in size with no obvious dilatation of intrahepatic ducts.
Over the next 24 hours levophed was weaned off and blood cultures returned positive for e coli resulting in the discontinuation of vancomycin.
A CTA Chest was also performed, but did not show evidence of pulmonary embolist.
Due to pressence of IVC filter MRCP could not be obtained and the patient transferred for ERCP evaluation.

IMAGING: -[**7-28**] CXR: There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
The mediastinum is widened due to tortuosity of the vessels.
Bibasilar atelectasis are larger on the right side.
There is mild vascular congestion.
Right greater than left perihilar and right upper lobe opacities are worrisome for pneumonia.
Compared to prior study there is mild interval increase in bilateral opacities.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
Bibasilar opacities larger on the right side have minimally increased, could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia.
Opacities in the upper lobes bilaterally right greater than left have minimally increased likely infectious in etiology.
There is mild vascular congestion.
Specifically, no evidence of pneumothorax.
-[**7-30**] Left Neck Venous Ultrasound: IMPRESSION:  Diminutive left internal jugular vein, which contains echogenic material and demonstrates minimal flow with pulsed but not with color Doppler, suggestive of thrombosis, likely chronic.
PROCEDURES: - ERCP [**2180-7-28**] --Medications: total time 4.2 minutes; glucagon 0.4 mg; 24.662 Gycm2, 296.16mGy; General Anesthesia --Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The patient was administered moderate sedation.
There were no complications.
----Biliary Tree Fluoroscopic Interpretation: A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring 10 mm.
----Procedures: Given cholangitis and dilated biliary tree, a sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring 10 mm.
iven cholangitis and dilated biliary tree, a sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo F with complicated medical history, including COPD and restrictive lung disease requiring 2 L O2 supplement at home, diastolic CHF, history of PE and DVT, recent fall c/b left femur fracture requiring ORIF, subsequent COPD exacerbation and E. coli pneumonia, rectus sheath hematoma leading to discontinuation of warfarin and IVC filter placement, and septic shock transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP given concern for ascending cholangitis and E. coli bacteremia.
# Sepsis/resolving septic shock secondary to E. coli ascending cholangitis.
While patient was at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Hospital1 **], she was weaned off levophed and treated with imipenem/cilastatin for E. coli bactermia/ascending cholangitis.
Imaging studies showed presence of cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Patient underwent ERCP with general anesthesia with sphincterotomy and evacuation of pus.
# Acute respiratory distress, most likely [**12-30**] acute on chronic diastolic heart failure in the setting of underlying COPD and restrictive lung disease, recent COPD exacerbation, and recent PNA.
CTA done in [**Hospital3 4107**] on [**2180-7-26**] did not show pulmonary embolism or persistent pneumonia, but did show significant compressive atelectasis.
Patient was noted to be on NR on initial presentation, crackles on exam, and evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR.
Given the low suspicion for ongoing COPD exacerbation, decision was made to taper her prednisone starting at 40mg and decreasing 10mg per day until she reaches her home dose for her PMR, especially in the setting of E. coli bacteremia/ascending cholangitis.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF.
Evident on exam, likely result of recent hospitalizations during which she received multiple blood products and likely IVF for the septic shock.
# History of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
Likely result of recent pulmonary events and possibly from recent acute on chronic diastolic CHF.
# Recent elevated troponin.
Likely recent of demand ischemia.
# Macrocytic anemia.
Has baseline anemia of chronic disease.
Anemia is likely worsen by recent trauma, surgery, hematoma, and infections.
Hgb and Hct at transfer noted to be 7.2 and 22.1, somewhat decreased from prior values, but VSS and no signs of bleeding on exam.
Suprapubic ecchymosis from rectal sheath hematoma noted to be receding, abdomen soft and without rebound or guarding on exam.
# History of PE and DVT.
She also has a history of a GI bleed from [**2180-3-28**].
Given her recent bleeding complications, would re-evaluate whether or not to continue warfarin.
# Rectus sheath hematoma.
Warfarin has been held since the discovery of the hematoma at [**Hospital3 **], and aspirin was held for ERCP (with the plan to hold for at least 5 days).
This will need to be clarified with patient's primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] recent ascending cholangitis and other adverse effects associated with prolonged use of steroid.
# Thrombocytopenia, mild.
It is most likely result of recent trauma/surgery and infection.
Given gradual decline in platelets (less than 50% decrease during this hospitalizaton), less likely due to HIT.
Also unlikely to be secondary to DIC since coags are within normal limits.
# History of left femur fracture, s/p ORIF at South Sure Hospital.
# Clot, Left IJ: Incidentally found to have clot in left IJ on attempt to place central venous line.
Formal U/S showed chronic appearing clot in left IJ, other left sided upper extremity veins patent.
No acute indication for anticoagulation given chronic appearance, risk of bleeding from recent ERCP with sphincterotomy.
You were transferred to this hospital for an ERCP procedure to help drain your gallbladder which we believe is the likely source of your blood stream infection.
