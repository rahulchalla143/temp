There are stable areas of atelectasis in the left mid and lower zones.
CONCLUSION:  Infiltrates at both lung bases suggestive of pneumonic consolidation.
==========  Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo male nursing home resident with dementia now admitted with worsening mental status at NH and then admitted with severe hypernatremia and likely active urinary tract infection.
He had, following arrival, some persistent and worsening of respiratory status with concern for aspiration pneumonia leading to two foci of infection as well.
# Altered Mental Status/delerium/underlying dementia: Pt was noted to be altered on admission, per family it seems his baseline is orientated to self, on admission pt was non-verbal.
Etiology of his Altered Mental Staus was multifactoral given his Alzheimers dementia, positive U/A, PNA, hypernatremia.
Overnight pt's mentation improved to the point that he was able to verbalize his name, and this improvement was in the setting of correction of his hypernatremia and antibiotics.
His delirium was likely multifactorial and due to PNA, dehydration, change of residence, etc.
# Hypernatremia: Na on admission was 162.
Discussed goals of care with pts wife, and she has stated that if pt were to continue poor po intake and to become dehydrated again, she would not want a PEG placed or rehospitalization (ie comfort measures at that point).
# Aspiration Pneumonia Vs HCAP: Given the nursing homes history of aspiration and the family continuing to feed the pt, pt's PNA most likely [**1-21**] aspiration.
A sputum culture was sent which grew out coag + staph aureus and gram neg rods.
He was started on Vanc as he came from a nursing home and is at risk for MRSA (also completed 7 day course).
He continued to cough and have evidence of aspiration even on this diet.
Treated with Vanc/Levoflox for PNA as well as per above.
# ?Parkinson's vs. Parkinsonism: Pt has no prior documented history of Parkinsons' but he does have masked facies, rigidity of his extremities, aspiration.
This may be related to progressive dementia with parkinsonism, but further evaluation for Parkinson's disease may be further pursued by a geriatric neurologist at his living facility.
# HTN: Held norvasc and lasix while aspiration risk, dehydrated, normotensive; would not advocate for restarting lasix or BP meds in setting of poor po intake, no need for tight BP control given pts age, aspiration risk with extra pills.
# Orthostasis: Holding fludrocortisone while mostly bed-bound, aspiration risk, and not felt to be an essential med.
# CAD s/p CABG: While NPO, given ASA PR.
# atrial fibrillation: On ASA.
Rate controlled here, no need for nodal blockade.
# Stage II sacral decub: Needs frequent turning and ongoing wound care.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for wheezing .
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. pneumonia, bacterial (HCAP versus aspiration) 2. delerium with underlying Alzheimer's dementia 3. hypernatremia from hypovolemia 4.
UTI versus chronic colonization (VRE) 5. coronary artery disease 6. atrial fibrillation  Discharge Condition: afebrile, mental status at baseline   Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized with a pneumonia, possibly from swallowing food or secretions into your lungs.
This still will not prevent further episodes of aspiration.
Call your doctor or return to the ER for any worsening dehydration, fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, worsening confusion, or any other concerning symptoms.
