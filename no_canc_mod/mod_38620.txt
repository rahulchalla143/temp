Admission Date:  [**2123-4-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2123-5-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-5-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Haldol / Fluphenazine / Chlorpromazine / Clozapine / Risperidone / Zyprexa / Reglan / Promethazine / Flagyl / Trileptal / Clindamycin / Cefazolin / Erythromycin Base / Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation/Sedation to allow medical care early in hospital course  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 90100**] is a 24 year-old woman with recent diagnosis of SLE vs possible Crohn's on steroid taper and pervasive development disorder (resides in a group home) who presents with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
She has been having diarrhea, no BRBPR or melena.
The mother feels that she is in pain as she brings her knees up to her chest.
Her symptoms began this weekend as above.
Howevever, her symptoms are different than in [**Month (only) 404**], given her emesis is clear and she is having watery diarrhea.
CT showed no obstruction but diffuse colitis.
Currently she is doing well with no clear abdominal pain.
- Pervasive developmental disorder - OCD - Bipolar disorder - Question of seizure disorder  Social History: She is single, lives in a group home in [**Location (un) 16843**], with visitations from the family on weekends.
Physical Exam: VS: T 98.2, BP 104/75, HR 111, RR 16, 100%RA Gen: well appearing, smiling, NAD HEENT: anicteric sclera, MMM, OP clear Neck: supple no LAD Heart: Tachy, regular, no m/r/g Lung: CTAB though exam limited by cooperation Abd: soft NT/ND +BS no rebound or guarding Skin: no obvious rashes though exam limited by cooperation Ext: no pitting edema, warm Neuro: alert, non-verbal, smiles and reactive.
Diffuse colitis, infectious, inflammatory, or vasculitis etiologies should be considered.
There is associated abdominal ascites, and small bowel dilatation.
Small bowel acute on chronic inflammatory change with dilated loops and wall edema.
No small bowel transition point is seen to suggest a mechanical bowel obstruction, and any component of partial obstruction is likely to be functional as the result of inflammation.
No CT signs of vasculitis of the abdominal vessels and no arterial or venous occlusion.
Small right pleural effusion.
SIGMOIDOSCOPY [**2123-4-8**]: - Moderately severe colitis with likely pseudomembrane in the sigmoid and descending colon (biopsy, biopsy) - Loss of vascularity in the rectum - Internal hemorrhoids - Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure  RECS: Await pathology report.
Likely C.diff colitis, but cannot rule-out Crohn's disease based on endoscopic appearance alone.
Send stool studies for C.diff toxin/PCR, and would initiate empiric therapy for C.diff colitis with PO/PR Vancomycin.
Would recommend against increasing steroid therapy for now given the concern and high likelihood for C.diff colitis, unless histologic evaluation appears otherwise.
- No pseudomembranes, vasculitis, or cryptitis seen (additional levels were examined).
PORTABLE ABDOMEN [**2123-4-12**]: Unchanged prominent loops of small bowel with some contrast seen in the ascending as well as descending colon likely representing essentially unchanged partial small bowel obstruction  Brief Hospital Course: 24 year-old woman with SLE, pervasive developmental disorder, who presented with nausea and vomiting feculant material [**1-20**] recurrent ileus vs. partial SBO associated with a probable vasculitis-induced colitis.
CT demonstrated bowel wall thickening suggestive of colitis.
Given patient's h/o lupus, there was concern for a possible vasculitic process.
Biopsies were non-dagnostic and did not demonstrate signs of vasculitis, cryptitis or psuedomembranes.
Nonetheless, it was the opinion of the rheumatology consult service that this likely represent vasculitis-associated colitis and her symptoms improved with ongoing prednisone and restarted azathioprine use.
Symptomatically the patient had significant improvement with apparent improvement in abdominal pain and distention.
He hospital course was complicated by pneumonia, with sputum growing out GI flora consistent with aspiration PNA, as well as UTI with EColi.
The patient will reufse PO meds sometimes, so because of clinical stability and difficulty with administering IV or PO meds, treatment for Coag-neg staph was stopped at 12 days (stopped [**4-21**]).
Ms. [**Known lastname 90100**] was followed by Psychiatry during her admission for behavioral issues and developmental disorder.
On [**4-23**], she was noted to have increased agitation and stated she had abdominal pain.
She has no signs of ongoing urinary difficulty.
For recurrent abdominal complaints or changes in urinary patterns, this issue should be re-investigated.
The patient had signs of a significant fungal infection of the perineum and intercrural region.
3. diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for acute agitation.
9. diazepam 5 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
10. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain fever.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: group home  Discharge Diagnosis: - Pancolitis, possibly from lupus - Systemic lupus erythematosus - Pneumonia, right upper lung, with MSSA and E. Coli from aspiration - Bacteremia, coagulase-negative staph aureus - Urinary tract infection, E. Coli - Urinary retention, resolved - Developmental delay  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with nausea and vomitting from colitis that we think is related to your lupus.
During the admission, you were also found to have a pneumonia, urinary infection and bacteremia, all of which were treated with antibiotics.
Have weekly blood testing while on azathioprine.
You were also noted to have urinary retention and a Foley catheter was placed.
