BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 9464**] is a 32-year-old male, with a history of osteogenesis imperfecta, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on [**2190-2-2**] with multiple injuries, who was transferred from an outside hospital for further evaluation.
After multiple radiographic imaging, the patient was found to have an epidural hematoma measuring 6x2 cm with mild midline shift, a right temporal region with extra-axial hematoma with an adjacent right temporal bone fracture, as well as fractures of the sphenoid bone.
An abdominal CT on the right showed a small hematoma in the pelvis with pelvic fracture, and possible fractures to the right temporal bone.
Multiple plain films revealed fractures in the ulna, femur, tibia, fibula, calcaneus, talus, and humerus bones, additionally, fractures in the pubic rami and sacrum, and multiple rib fractures.
An exploratory laparotomy was performed to evaluate for increased abdominal pressure.
Intraoperatively, bowel edema was found, as well as retroperitoneal edema.
There was no tension pneumo.
The patient is status post washout of his left thigh wound which had grown on cultures rare Pseudomonas.
He underwent an open reduction and internal fixation of the tibial plateau fracture, and open reduction and internal fixation of the right comminuted olecranon fracture, as well as repair of his medial collateral ligament.
The patient had a short course of TPN for nutritional support.
No operative intervention was needed.
Various cultures while in the ICU were notable for a positive C. diff stool sample for which the patient was placed on Flagyl.
A left hip culture which grew out Pseudomonas and Enterococcus.
Sputum which had Pseudomonas with strep beta hemolytic organisms.
A right distal tibia wound grew out gram-positive cocci suggestive of Enterococcus.
His fever spikes eventually resolved.
They recommended continuing methadone at 25 mg po tid, as well as including morphine elixir for breakthrough pain.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post motor vehicle accident with prolonged extraction, with multiple fractures, epidural hematoma, and multiple facial fractures.
His injuries include:  A left occipital subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage; fracture of the sphenoid sinus; temporal bone fracture; an epidural hematoma, status post left frontal vein vent; status post open reduction and internal fixation with IM [**Last Name (LF) **], [**2-12**], three separate comminuted fractures of the left humerus, proximal, mid and distal; comminuted olecranon fracture with proximal retraction at the triceps insertion; medial epicondyle fracture on the left; left distal ulnar fracture; multiple left rib fractures; left pneumothorax; right sacral fracture, olecranon fracture; left comminuted intertrochanteric fracture; two comminuted fractures of the mid and distal left femur; severely comminuted left proximal tibia and proximal fibula; comminuted displaced distal tibia, calcaneus and talus fracture; a right comminuted dislocated shattered ulna and humerus; a right superior and inferior pubic rami fractures.
He has a right tibial plateau fracture, as well as lastly a comminuted displaced distal tibia and fibula on right.
