He experienced, dull diffuse headache w/o any other neurological symptoms besides difficulty in ambulating over 4 days.
The headache stayed stable but also noticed difficulty in memory.
His wife noticed that he seemed to be slower in the response and occasionally had poor attention during the conversation.
Patient denied any weakness, numbness and he himself denied difficulty in comprehension and speech.
Denied any trauma episode over the past month.

No nucal rigidity.
There has been a dramatic decrease in the size of the subdural collection with a small amount of largely low-density subdural collection over the left frontal convexity.
A small amount of gas is seen within this collection.
The degree of subfalcine herniation has also improved with approximately 5 mm of rightward herniation persisting.
Degree of sulcal effacement and left lateral ventricular compression has also significantly improved.
Post-surgical swelling and gas over the left frontal and parietal lobes is observed.
IMPRESSION: Status post left craniotomy with marked reduction in size of left subdural hematoma.
Small predominantly hypodense left frontal subdural collection with decreased mass effect identified, and proportionally reduced rightward subfalcine herniation.
[**1-14**] CTA head CTA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: A large heterogeneous fluid collection is again demonstrated along the left cerebral convexity surface, measuring approximately 2.8 cm in greatest axial dimension.
Significant mass effect exerted upon the left lateral ventricle is again identified along with approximately 1.7 cm of rightward subfalcine herniation.
Again, the basal cisterns do not appear to be effaced and there is no evidence of uncal herniation.
No significant stenoses of the visualized portions of the vertebral and internal carotid arteries are seen bilaterally.
Previously noted large left cerebral convexity subdural hematoma producing prominent rightward subfalcine herniation.
No aneurysms or focal stenoses identified.
There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary infiltrate.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt admitted from the emergency room to the SICU and was taken to the operating room the following morning for evacuation of left-sided subdural hematoma.
No intraop/postop complications.
Pt transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 and was mobilized, diet advanced, foley cath removed all without difficulty.
On POD#4 pt was ready for discharge he was alert and orientatedX3 no pronator drift, incision was clean and dry.
