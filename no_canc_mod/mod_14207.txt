**IMAGING** CXR [**2189-2-14**]: Left lower lobe collapse and associated small pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: # Sepsis: Most likely secondary to ventilator associated pneumonia seen on CXR.
Elevated WBC with bandemia.
Subsequently blood cultures positive [**3-13**] for Staph coag negative.
TTE negative for vegetations.
No more fluid resuscitation needed after 2L in ED and subsequent 2L on the floor.
Sputum culture with oropharyngeal flora.
Lactate initially elevated at 3.4, subsequently improved.
# Respiratory failure: due to to ventilator associated pneumonia and associated left lower lobe collapse.
Treatment of PNA and bactermia with Vancomycin as above.
# Psychiatric: continued on Sertraline, Mirtazapine and Trazodone .
# GLucose intolerance: started on insulin sliding scale .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventilator associated pneumonia Left lower lobe collapse Acute renal failure likely from ischemic ATN   Discharge Condition: conversant through eye blinking, quadriplegic   Discharge Instructions: Admitted for ventilator associated pneumonia.
Subsequently blood cultures positive for Staph coag negative.
Pt also found to have rising creatinine, likely due to initial hypotension in the context of GPC sepsis.
