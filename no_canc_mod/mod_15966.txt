Maternal screen notable for maternal blood type O positive, antibody negative, hep B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, group B strep an absent left kidney and later a constellation of findings consistent with tuberous sclerosis complex including cardiac rhabdomyomas and subependymal CNS tubers.
He subseuqently had multiple desaturation episodes of undetermined etiology.
He developed some mild hypotension.
Cardiac rhythm was also noted to be mildly abnormal.
Hypotension rapidly resolved and he did not require any further boluses or blood pressure medications.
Echo was performed which showed the presence of rhabdomyomas, but no outflow obstruction and good ventricular function.
EKG was consistent with intermittent sinus arrhythmia with premature atrial contractions.
He had one episode of bradycardia with desaturation which was self-resolving.
He had an MRI done which showed the presence of multiple subependymal tubers in a classic distribution for tuberous sclerosis.
He has not had any evidence of seizures.
He is on no neurologic medications.
72-hour intermittent EEG was ordered because of the desaturation episodes, but these resolved before the test was started.
The child should have a followup renal ultrasound in approximately one to two months.
