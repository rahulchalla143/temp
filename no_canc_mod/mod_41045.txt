Admission Date:  [**2197-3-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-5-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2123-11-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: Right cerebellar hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2197-3-21**] Suboccipital crani for evacuation of the Right cerebellar hemorrhage [**2197-3-21**] Right frontal EVD placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 73 year old man with hypertension and vascular disease transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with reported cerebellar hemorrhage.
He was markedly hypertensive on arrival -- BP was recorded initially as 232/132 (VS otherwise unremarkable).
He was given Zofran and labetalol, and when his systolics remained elevated in the 200s, he was started on a nitroprusside drip.
He was taken for NCHCT, which showed a 3cm Right cerebellar hemorrhage.
At some point during this initial evaluation, he became acutely non-responsive, so he was intubated (induced with etomodate and succinylcholine, also fentanyl) and Med-Flighted here to [**Hospital1 18**].
He arrived here around 21:30 with BP 267/131, down to 168/96 with increased nitroprusside gtt rate.
Hypertension 2.
Renal artery stenosis 3.
AAA endovascular repair c/b R ext iliac pseudoaneurysm, also s/p repair [**2195**] 4.
Peripheral vascular disease 5.
Hyperlipidemia 7.
COPD   Social History: Lives alone, ex wife lives in U.S. but the rest of extended family resides in [**Country 1684**].
Eyes mid-position with no movement.
Initially, no corneal response or response to nasal tickle.
Later, bilateral weak eyelash-blink responses and legs moved to bilateral nasal tickle.
Face was symmetrically lax; when he later furrowed his brow to noxious stimulation, it elevated symmetrically.
Initially, no gag or cough; later strong cough (tracheal suction) and weak gag (gentle ETT-wiggle).
Pertinent Results: Head CT [**2197-3-20**]: FINDINGS: Centered within the right cerebellum, there is a 5.4 x 3 cm hyperdense hemorrhage with surrounding edema (previously 2.8 x 3 cm); this hemorrhage crosses the cerebellar vermis into the left cerebellar hemisphere.
Hyperdense blood is seen within the fourth ventricle extending up into the third ventricle.
There is no significant shift of normally midline structures.
The posterior fossa is expanded with mass effect on the brainstem.
No acute fracture is seen.
IMPRESSION: Large parenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right cerebellar hemisphere with intraventricular extension, mass effect, and hydrocephalus as above, increased since 2 hours prior.
Interval occipital craniectomy with increased but residual hyperdense blood in the cerebellum and ventricles; evaluation of mass effect is suboptimal on this study due to portable technique.
Interval placement of a right frontal approach ventricular catheter with persistent hydrocephalus.
Interval significant decrease of the hydrocephalus with normal size of the lateral ventricles and with the EVD in place.
Increase of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the both temporal and occipital lobes, likely due to redistribution of the intraventricular hemorrhage.
Compared to the most recent prior study from [**2197-3-21**], unchanged amount of hemorrhage in the fourth ventricle and the cerebellar hemispheres.
CT head [**2197-3-25**] Overall stable examination without significant hydrocephalus in the setting of external ventricular drain.
Parenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right cerebellum with extension into the fourth ventricle and biparietal/bitemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage, similar to 20 hours prior.
Interval removal of the right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter with hyperdensity along catheter tract, representing minor parenchymal hemorrhage with trace intraventricular extension.
Otherwise, the appearance is largely unchanged with biparietal and bitemporal subarachnoid blood, likely redistributional, related to the right cerebellar hemispheric hemorrhage with fourth ventricular extension, status post occipital craniectomy.
CT head [**2197-3-27**] Unchanged right cerebellar hemorrhage with intraventricular extension into the fourth ventricle.
Unchanged biparietal and bitemporal subarachnoid blood.
Unchanged minor parenchymal hemorrhage along the prior ventriculostomy catheter tract.
No evidence of vascular territorial infarction  LENIS [**2197-3-28**]  IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremities.
Previously noted pulmonary edema has resolved.
Small bilateral pleural effusions noted.
No pneumothorax.
Lower Extremity Doppler Ultrasound [**2197-4-4**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either right or left lower extremity.
LENIS [**4-12**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
This may be related to volume loss from surgery, but the patient should be followed for intracranial hypotension with clinical correlation.
Expected evolution of intracranial hemorrhage with decreased density of right cerebellar hemispheric hemorrhage, and near complete resolution of subarachnoid and ventriculostomy catheter tract hemorrhage.
Prior to this procedure a R frontal EVD was placed without difficulty.
A head CT on the morning of [**3-21**] showed good evacuation of ICH and decreased hydrocephalus.
On [**3-22**] he was extubated without difficulty.
On [**3-24**], The patient experienced respiratory issues overnight into am.
A CXR was consistent with worseing consolidation and empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated for for Ventilatory Aquired Pneumonia.
A NCHCT was performed which was consistent with good placement EVD and no hydrocephalas.
Emergent reintubation at 1230pm for poor ventilatory status.
The steroids were discontinued as the patient has pneumonia and Cdiff concurrently.
He had no sign of hydrocephalus on [**3-28**].
On [**3-29**] his dressing remained clean and dry without evidence of leak and the patient continued to improved neurologically.
He had some hypotension on [**4-1**] that responded to fluid bolus.
On [**4-3**] his abdomen was found to be distended and post void bladder scan revealed 1000cc remaining in the bladder so a foley was replaced and the patient was started on Flomasx.
His creatinine bumped on [**4-4**] to 2.1 (baseline elevated > 1.3) likely due to mild dehydration as his oral intake was poor.
His sutures were removed on [**4-4**].....He had screening LENIs on [**4-4**] that were again negative for DVT.
A stool sample was sent on [**4-11**] which was negative for Cdiff.
of some small blood tinged mucus.
His CT was stable with no changes.
On [**5-8**] he continued to have nausea and poor PO intact.
He continued to have abdominal discomfort despite c-diff negative x3.
Throughout his hospital course, he coninued to have episodes of nausea with occasional vomiting.
This responded well to Zofran and fluid resuscitation.
The psychiatry team recommended starting remeron to help with sleep/wake cycle.
He had another repeat LENIs on [**5-13**] which showed no evidence of DVT.
A CT head was obtained on [**5-14**] which showed expected evolution of intracranial hemorrhages.
No acute infarct or hemorrhage.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
On [**5-17**] Urology was re-consulted for persistent failure to void.
They also recommended intermittent catheterization, which is preferred over indwelling foley catheter but this was not possible due to patient's lack of participation.
Patient's pain is well-controlled and the patient is tolerating a good oral diet.
Pt's incision is clean, dry and inctact without evidence of infection.
Patient is ambulating safely over short distances and has been given a wheelchair for longer distances.
Atrovent HFA 17 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: One (1) Inhalation Inhalation q6hr as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right cerebellar hemorrhage Intraventricular hemorrhage Hydrocephalus Cerebral edema Confusion C-Diff VAP Respiratory failure requiring intubation Hypotension Urinary retention Nausea Vomiting Orthostasis Malnutrition  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
