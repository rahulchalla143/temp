Small amount of free fluid is seen in the lower abdomen; however, there is no fluid pocket sufficient for marking.
IMPRESSION: Moderate amount of ascites surrounding the liver and small amount of ascites in the lower abdomen.
CXR ([**7-7**]): FINDINGS: There is a new left IJ central catheter with tip in the left brachiocephalic vein.
The right pleural effusion has increased in size, now moderate-to-large.
Persistent shift of the heart to the right indicates partial collapse of the right lower and possibly middle lobes.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
Diffuse opacity of the abdomen suggests ascites.
Worsening right pleural effusion and associated collapse of the right lower and probably right middle lobes.
RUQ US w/ Doppler ([**7-8**]): LIMITED ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver is diffusely hyperechoic and has a nodular contour, compatible with cirrhosis.
There is marked splenomegaly.
Diminished flow in the posterior right portal vein since the prior study of [**Month (only) 1096**].
Moderate ascites.
A position for paracentesis was marked in the right lower quadrant.
Echo ([**7-9**]): Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate global hypokinesis without regionality.
The right ventricle is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic stenosis is seen.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small, primarily anterior pericardial effusion withtout echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-2-7**], there has been a decline in left and right ventricular systolic function.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased, the effusion is more prominent (but remains very small) and atrial fibrillation is now present.
An atrial septal defect is not seen on the current study (may be related to technical differences).
The moderate-sized right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size.
There continues to be associated compressive atelectasis.
A small left pleural effusion is also noted.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
Slight decrease in size of moderate right pleural effusion.
Small left pleural effusion.
Bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated, right more than left, grossly unchanged.
The bibasal atelectasis is unchanged as well.
There is new linear opacity in the left lower lobe representing additional plate-like atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo M with alcoholic cirrhosis, grade II varices, non-occlusive portal vein thrombosis with recannulization admitted to the MICU with hypotension and atrial flutter/fibrillation with resolution s/p fluids and rate control subsequently called out to the floor for continued management.
# Hypotension: Etiology thought to be secondary to cirrhosis vs Afib/flutter with RVR, resolved with IVF and HR control.
While on the general medicine floor, the patient was continued on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for possible PNA and or presumed SBP.
In the setting of diuresis, the patient at one point became hypotensive to 80/50.
Diuresis thereafter for obvious fluid overload was difficult given the tenuous blood pressure.
# Arrhythmia: New-onset Afib/Aflutter on presentation was thought to be related to discontinuation of Nadolol as an outpatient.
However, because of hypotension as detailed above, additional rate control agents could not be added and yet the patient was intermittently tachycardic to the 140s.
He was not symptomatic, but continued management, mainly of his heart failure became complicated.
Cardioversion was not an option given the patient's relative contraindication to anticoagulation given known grade 2 esophageal varices.
# Heart Failure: Patient's echo on [**7-9**] showed biventricular heart failure, changed from prior imaging, with no evidence of infarct on EKG.
With this diuresis, the patient's creatinine bumped predictably and he had a contraction alkalosis on daily labs.
Additionally, his O2 requirement decreased from 3 liters to 1 liter.
However, he continued to have 3+ pitting edema beyond his knees in both LEs with a normal albumin.
For this reason, the CHF service was reconsulted and the patient was taken for a right and left heart cardiac catheterization, after which he was transferred to the acute cardiac floor for continuous diuresis with a Lasix drip.
Unfortunatelty due to hypotension he was unable to be furtehr diuresed and the gtt discontinued.
# Decompensated cirrhosis: RUQ U/S revealed diminished flow in the posterior right portal vein since the prior study of [**Month (only) 1096**].
Given documented esophageal varices in house, the patient was continued on Nadolol.
# ARF: Creatinine was elevated initially to 1.3, which was likely in the setting of poor forward flow from cirrhosis.
This resolved with diuresis but then in the setting of further diuresis, hypotension and worsening decompensated liver failure complicated by CHF his Cr started to rise most likely mised ATN amd pre-renal azotemia.
He never had any obvious bleeding or signs of bleeding.
# Goals of Care:  Due to worsening decompensated liver failure and CHF discussion as to goals of care were had between patient, wife and primary team.
