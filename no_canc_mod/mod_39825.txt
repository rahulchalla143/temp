Admission Date:  [**2119-12-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-12-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-3-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory Failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 68 yo F with end stage pulmonary fibrosis likely secondary to hypersensitivity pneumonitis, progressively declining over the last few months.
Since then she developed mucus plugging with increased coughing.
Yesterday morning her family called 911 because of respiratory distress.
She was brought to an OSH where she was found to be oxygenating in the low 80's with a decreased mental status.
Per report her chest tube was to low wall suction with serosanguinous output.
She developed an air leak in her chest tube on the evening of transfer.
Enroute to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was originally on a propofol drip but became hypotensive.
Decreased urine output.

lung disease) Father - died age 64 colon cancer  Physical Exam: Vitals - HR 93 SBP 94/64 RR 8 O2100% on AC 350 x 14 100% FIO2 5 PEEP General - sedated, follows simple commands HEENT - PERRL Neck - supple, transtracheal catether in place; insertion site clean, dry, and intact CV - RRR Lungs - diffuse rhonchi Abdomen - soft, NT/ND Ext - 1+ edema bilateral lower extreities   Pertinent Results: [**2119-12-16**] ECHO: The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis/akinetic.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
No right atrial diastolic collapse is seen.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
The left ventricle is hyperdynamic and underfilled in the setting of right ventricular failure.
The pericardial effusion is increased in size, but still small.
No evidence of bile duct abnormality.
Small volume ascites noted.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 68 yo F with end stage pulmonary fibrosis likely secondary to hypersensitivity pneumonitis s/p TTO catether placed on [**2119-12-6**] at [**Hospital1 18**].
Yesterday the patient had respiratory distress at home and was brought to an OSH.
She was found to have a tension pneumothorax and a right sided chest tube was placed.
Originally it was though secondary to hypovolemia.
1 hour later, again became hypotensive and needed a central line placed and to be restarted on pressors.
There was concern about sepsis, but there was no obvious source.
She was started on vancomycin, ceftazadine, levofloxacin, and flagyl for broad coverage.
She had profound respiratory and metabolic acidosis; this did not appear to be mediated by a tension pneumothorax.
This resulted in some hemodynamic stability, as well as stabilization of the respiratory component of her acidosis.
