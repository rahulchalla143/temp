# Peridontal abscess:  Ms [**Known lastname 81697**] was transferred to medicine after incision and drainage of her peridontal abscess by OMFS the night of admission.
She tolerated the procedure well without complication.
Blood cultures and abscess cultures were sent and became positive for strep viridans.
She initially did well after the first drainage, however she continued to have pain with swallowing and her drain began draining pus.
On [**7-15**] due to concern for worsening of her swallowing, she underwent a neck CT which showed presistent collection.
Abscess cultures grew out strep viridans, and an ID consultation was obtained.
She remained intubated for 6 days for severe swelling of her airway secondary to the abscess and surgical swelling.
However, at the time of transfer she remained unable to tolerate POs due to the primrose drains continuing to have significant drainage.
# Hypoxia:  After her initial surgery she became hypoxic to the high 80's on RA, requiring 2-3L of NC.
Her lung exam revealed crackles halfway up her lung fields and her CXR looked wet, but without evidence of pneumonia.
Given her acute renal failure, diuresis was initially held and she was allowed to auto-diurese.
During her MICU stay, she had a sputum culture which grew out H. influenza and Enterobacter that was negative for beta-lactamase.
This was adequately covered with the unasyn which the patient was being treated with for her abscess.
# Acute renal failure:  The patient's Cr decreased from 1.9 to 1.3 with IVF.
She likely had prerenal ARF due to decreased po intake in the setting of painful swalling due to her dental abscess.
However, her PO intake increased quickly during the next days as her pain decreased.
# Postive blood culture:  Her admission blood culture [**2-4**] grew out gram positive cocci.
# Hypertension:  Patient is hypertensive at baseline, but on transfer to MICU had low blood pressures.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Her statin was initially held due to pain with swallowing, but was restarted prior to discharge.
