Admission Date:  [**2118-1-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2118-1-31**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 78-year-old Hispanic female with past medical history significant for diabetes, hypertension and pernicious anemia who complained of not feeling well for three days.
Patient had an episode of chest heaviness, which was relieved immediately, and has been experiencing increasing shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and had been described by her son as [**Name2 (NI) **] and diaphoretic.
On the day of admission, the patient had her usual appointment with her primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] an electrocardiogram was taken showing ischemic changes.
Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.
Patient was given aspirin, Lopressor, Lasix, intravenous nitroglycerin, after which ST segment depressions decreased from 1 to 2 mm.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes, hypertension, no coronary artery disease.
General:  Patient is an elderly female appearing comfortable in no acute distress.
Cardiac exam:  Normal S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm, no S3 or S4, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at right upper sternal border.
No wheezes or rhonchi.
Abdomen soft, nontender, mildly distended.
Chest x-ray consistent with congestive heart failure.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The impression was that this is a 78-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension presenting with a non ST elevation myocardial infarction with electrocardiogram consistent with likely significant coronary artery disease (left main disease versus critical three vessel disease).
However, the patient later agreed to go for a cardiac catheterization, which was done two days after admission, which showed 90% stenosis of proximal left circumflex, which was successfully stented, distal occlusion of right coronary artery, which was not intervened on, D1 with 40% stenosis, and left anterior descending with mild disease.
Hemodynamics during cardiac catheterization revealed severely elevated left-sided filling pressures (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 35 mm).
Left ventriculogram showed akinesis of the inferior wall, hypokinesis of the apical, anterolateral, and anterobasal walls with an ejection fraction of 33%, mild mitral regurgitation.
The patient complained of no further episodes of chest pain afterwards.
B.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient clinically appeared to be in congestive heart failure on admission, as she was requiring 100% nonrebreather face mask and had significant rales on physical examination.
However, during a red blood cell transfusion, which the patient received after cardiac catheterization for a hematocrit of 24, the patient developed shortness of breath despite treatment with Lasix prior to transfusion and developed an increased oxygen requirement of four liters nasal cannula.
Despite Lasix diuresis, the patient persistently had an increased oxygen requirement of two to four liters nasal cannula.
A chest x-ray was taken revealing persistent congestive heart failure with cephalization of pulmonary vasculature and a large left-sided pleural effusion.
It was decided not to tap the effusion, as it was felt that with returning cardiac function, post myocardial infarction and with adequate daily diuresis with standing Lasix, the patient's congestive heart failure and effusions would resolve.
The patient never complained of shortness of breath even with her increased oxygen requirement.
Renal:   With the patient's history of diabetes and with an elevated creatinine to 1.4 on admission, the patient was given Mucomyst prior to cardiac catheterization for renal protection.
With diuresis for congestive heart failure, the patient's BUN and creatinine were noted to rise from 33/1.4 to 57/1.6, sodium decreased from 132 to 126 (presumably secondary to diureses as well).
It was decided that diuresis would have to be continued at the expense of making patient prerenal in order to treat congestive heart failure.
The patient was placed on free water restriction for hyponatremia.
As her MCV was low, the patient's anemia was presumably not secondary to her pernicious anemia.
