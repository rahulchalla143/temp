He initially presented in liver decompensation with variceal bleeding, ascites, and encephalopathy in [**2109-6-2**], and recently established care with the transplant center in [**2110-5-4**].
His endoscopies have shown isolated gastric varices and esophageal varices (grade II) which have been banded x 3.
He has also had h/o three large volume paracentesis, partly felt to be due to poor compliance with low salt diet.
At that time, he had mild hepatic encephalopathy and was on lactulose, having [**4-6**] BM per day.
Per d/w patient's fiancee, he had been having abdominal pain, nausea, and bilious vomiting 2 days PTA.
1 week PTA patient did have tooth infection and was given amoxicillin as well as motrin.
RUQ and RUS were performed, with results showing, "cirrhosis, portal htn, reversal of portal venous flow, varices, and splenomegaly, mild to moderate residual ascites s/p paracentesis, kidneys without hydronephrosis."

gas pattern with mild small bowel dilation.
Early or partial obstruction cannot be excluded.
KUB [**6-22**]: IMPRESSION:  Supine and left decubitus views show there is no pneumoperitoneum.
However moderate generalized distention of large and small bowel has progressed since [**6-20**], and appreciable wall thickening particularly in the transverse colon and in small bowel loops in the left lower abdomen is new.
This is not a pattern of obstruction, but of ileus and requires careful attention for the possible contribution of ischemia.
Diffuse small bowel wall thickening and dilation most likely secondary to ascites, portal hypertension, and hypoalbuminemia.
There is no evidence of small-bowel obstruction.
Nodular liver contour, extensive splenic and esophageal varices consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
Low lung volumes.
No pleural effusions.
No pneumonia, but areas of atelectasis at the left lung base.
No pneumothorax.
CT Head [**6-26**]: IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
No acute cervical spine fracture.
No canal or foraminal stenosis.
A 2.1x1.8cm mass lesion in right parotid- ?
node/neoplasm-correlate with ultrasound/soft tissue MRI neck on a non-emergent basis.
Brief Hospital Course: 46 y/o male with ETOH cirrhosis, previous hepatitis C infection with spontaneous clearance in [**2109**] (recent HCV VL undetectable), polysubstance abuse with a one-year abstinence per notes, who is transferred from OSH with acute encephalopathy, acute kidney injury, and ascites.
On [**6-22**] had tachycardia and hematochezia/[**Hospital 58799**] transferred to the MICU and found with portal gastropathy/duodenopathy and esophageal varices which were banded.
On [**6-25**], the patient had a fall from a likely seizure with elevated lactate to 10 and transferred to the MICU.
Again, he was stabilized in the ICU and called out to the floor on [**6-26**], without any change in his previous management.
# Seizure: On [**6-26**] patient was witnessed to fall by roommate with associated convulsions and bowel incontinence.
The patient was post-ictal afterwards and had an elevated lactate to 10, which downtrended back to 1 prior to discharge.
He had a normal head CT and neck (only small parotid gland mass noted).
The patient has report of seizure-like activity by fiance in the past when withdrawing from alcohol, but otherwise has no seizure history.
Neurology ultimately recommended outpatient MRI of the brain to rule out intracranial mass and felt that there was no indication for AEDs at this time.
Bleed likely [**3-6**] esophageal varices (3 cords of grade II varices) and severe portal gastropathy/duodenopathy.
HCTs stable after 2u PRBC and 2u FFP till time of discharge without any further episodes of hematemesis or hematochezia.
# Hepatic encephalopathy: Transferred from [**Hospital 792**]Hospital for dense encephalopathy and acute renal failure.
On admission here it was felt that the patient's distended abdomen and nausea/vomiting to any PO was consistent with an obstructive process, so KUB was performed which showed a likely small bowel ileus.
The encephalopathy was managed with PR lactulose initially with some clearing of mental status.
# Acute renal failure: Resolved after albumin resuscitation.
RUS was without obstruction and no hydronephrosis noted.
From scans it was unclear whether this was a true thrombosis so anticoagulation was deferred in setting of GIB.
# Ileus: Initially presented with nausea/vomiting at home for 2 days prior to presentation.
After 5L paracentesis at OSH, it was noted that his abdomen continued to be tense and tympanic to percussion.
KUB was consistent with early ileus vs SBO.
# ETOH cirrhosis: c/b grade II esophageal varices, ascites, encephalopathy.
On this admission, complicated by encephalopathy and GIB, ascites not an issue after restarting home diuretics.
Outstanding tests include further imaging studies of the parotid mass noted on CT neck (per radiology, evaluate with ultrasound or MRI) as well as PFTs.
Transitional Issues: - possible MRI brain for seizure workup - MRI vs ultrasound of parotid mass for transplant workup - PFTs for transplant workup - possible MRI for portal vein thrombosis workup   Medications on Admission: - docusate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] - lactulose titrate to 4 BM per day - lasix 40 mg qPM - lasix 80 mg qAM - nexium 40 mg daily - oxycontin 40 mg q12 hrs - prochlorperazine prn - propanolol 10 mg tid - aldactone 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] - tramadol 50 mg q6 hrs prn  Discharge Medications: 1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).
Disp:*120 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hepatic encephalopathy Small bowel ileus versus obstruction Acute renal failure Upper GI bleeding Suspected Seizure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had encephalopathy, acute renal failure, decompensation of cirrhosis, small bowel ileus, acute gastrointestinal bleeding and had what was likely a seizure.
