Admission Date:  [**2186-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-8-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-2-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: left sided weakness, left sided facial droop transferred from OSH for eval for intra-arterial tPA  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 111885**] is an 81 year-old right-handed gentleman with a history of hyperlipidemia, a-fib s/p ablation currently on coumadin, essential tremors, who presents after he fell in the bathroom and found to have dense right sided weakness.
He again did not notice anything wrong (this however is not reliable as he does not believe there is any weakness now as part of his right MCA syndrome).
He was taken to [**Hospital6 3105**], where he received an NIHSS of 9 (breakdown not available on the provided notes) and his head CT did not show acute infarcts by report.
Patient is on coumadin which was stopped on Tuesday due to an elevated INR.
He was therefore not an IV rTPA candidate, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible IA rTPA.
Exam was notable for dense L flaccid plegia, nosoagnosia, visual extinction on the L, R gaze preference, impaired body position sensation on the L. Patient immediately was sent for CTA for further characterization of his stroke.
[**Name2 (NI) **] very rarely drinks a beer or a scotch.
Family History: His father had a stroke at age [**Age over 90 **] years.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
There were no paraphasic errors.
was able to name both high and low frequency objects.
Speech was mildly dysarthric.
He has at least a partial left sided neglect and denies any weakness on that side.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch with no extinction on double simultaneous stimulation.
No pronator drift bilaterally.
No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted.
No asterixis noted.
He has loss of proprioception on the left side.
Graphestesia and object recognistion are impaired on the left.
-Coordination:  No dysmetria ( only tested on the right)  -Gait: unable to stand.
Dense hemiplegia affecting left face, left arm and left leg.
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT ([**7-28**]): There is a hyperdense middle cerebral artery on the right with obscuration of the lentiform nucleus on the right consistent with infarction.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
No fracture is identified.
CT PERFUSION ([**7-28**]): There is a matched perfusion defect in the right MCA territory with delayed transit time and reduced blood flow and blood volume.
HEAD AND NECK CTA ([**7-28**]): There is abrupt termination of the right superior M2 division of the MCA consistent with an occlusion.
The left carotid and bilateral vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent with no evidence of stenosis.
There is a calcified plaque at the proximal right internal carotid artery with 25% stenosis.
There is no evidence of aneurysm formation.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**12-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild moderate mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
CHEST X-RAY ([**7-28**]): No focal infiltrate.
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT ([**8-1**], our read): expected evolution of right MCA infarct with known hemorrhagic conversion.
No new acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 111885**] is an 81 year-old right-handed gentleman with a history of hyperlipidemia, a-fib s/p ablation currently on coumadin, essential tremors, who presented to an OSH after he fell in the bathroom and had severe left sided weakness.
His exam was concerning for a dense right MCA infarct.
CTA revealed a right M2 superior division cutoff.
Even with the assumption that he was last well seen at 6:30 am as he reports he had no trouble then (which is not reliable due to presence of neglect), he was not an IV tpa candidate due to an elevated INR.
Most likely, infarct was embolic in setting of afib despite appropriate INR.
In ICU he underwent stroke risk factor workup including TTE (showed no PFO/ASD), full lipid panel (showed LDL 66) and A1C (mildly elevated to 6.4%).
MRI was performed, confirming presence of right MCA infarct.
Of note, the MRI also showed some hemorrhagic conversion of the stroke, but regardless it was decided to continue anticoagulating patient as his neuro exam was stable.
Repeat head CT on day of discharge showed no increase in hemorrhage.
His home cilostazole should also be continued, as patient has CAD and requires anti-platelet therapy.
On discharge, neuro exam was stable to mildly improved from admission: patient AAOx3 with abullic affect, and dense left face/arm/leg hemiplegia.
===================== TRANSITIONS OF CARE: - please D/C Foley when pt arrives to rehab facility, and check post-void residuals - please HOLD morning dose of Lovenox until INR is checked on [**2186-8-2**].

Dysphagia screening before any PO intake?
(x) Yes - () No (if LDL >100, Reason Not Given: ) 10.
Discharged on oral anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter?
Atrial fibrillation 2.
Hyperlipidemia 3.
Essential tremor   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 111885**],  You were admitted to the hospital for weakness in your left face, arm and leg.
You were found to have a large stroke on the right side of your brain.
This stroke was likely due to your atrial fibrillation, which can cause blood clots to form in the heart and travel to the brain.
We made some changes to your blood thinner medications to help prevent another blood clot from forming and leading to a stroke in the future.
