Per EMS reports this morning she began to experience shortness of breath and an ambulance was caused.
Four attempts were made to intubate the patient for her hypercarbic respiratory failure but all were unsuccessful due to a very narrow airway below the cords.
On arrival here given her history of subglottic stenosis she received cefepime/vanc in the ED then went directly to the OR for a revision tracheostomy by the ENT service.
This went uneventfully and after the procedure she was transferred to the ICU for management of her primary respiratory process.
Past Medical History: COPD -S/P G tube placement -Chronic abdominal pain -History of "bleeding from spleen" per daughter -Hypothyroidism -History of prolonged respiratory failure complicated by subglottic stenosis s/p a balloon dilation approximately one month ago at [**Hospital1 3278**] -Last trach removed in summer of this year -Diabetes Mellitus   Social History: She has resided at a combination of [**Hospital1 4187**], LTAC's, and multiple hospitals for the past year.

Airway issues: The patient likely had a COPD exacerbation in the context of known subglottic stenosis leading to hypercarbic failure or progressive stenosis leading to respiratory failure due to increased work of breathing.
Depression/chronic abdominal pain: Continued duloxetine, fentanyl patch, and oxycodone PRN .
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were also treated for infection and COPD.
