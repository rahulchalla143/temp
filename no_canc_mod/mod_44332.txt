The final pathology on the dermatologic biopsy showed epidermal necrosis with thrombi consistent with DIC.
The final culture exhibited a negative gram stain with only rare coag negative staph which was thought to be a contaminant.
Acute renal failure: The patient transferred out of the unit with diagnosis of acute renal failure secondary to ATN.
She required no further hemodialysis beyond that date and thus the dialysis catheter was not replaced.
Diarrhea: The patient had significant amount of diarrhea which caused her incredible distress.
She continued to have diarrhea on Flagyl and this was converted to p.o.
A CT was done to rule out ischemic colitis.
The CT was negative for evidence of bowel wall thickening.
Her case reports there is an association of hyposplenism and pneumococcal sepsis in patient's with celiac sprue.
Tissue transglutaminase IGA were sent and found following discharged to be elevated at a level of 36.
She was sating fine on room air with no complaints of dyspnea.
Status post severe pneumococcal sepsis: Infectious disease was consulted and recommended follow up for immunologic work up at [**Hospital3 5223**].
Staring spells: The patient with a history of staring spells while on the floor and MRI was obtained on [**2125-6-17**] which revealed no structural abnormalities and no sign of infarction or edema.
No focal or epileptiform features were noted.
Fever of unknown origin: Upon transfer to the floor, the patient spiked a temperature to 102.2.
A thorough work up was initiated including pelvic exam by her primary OB/GYNECOLOGY followed by transvaginal ultrasound with very minimal concern for possible endometritis.
Blood cultures, urine cultures and chest x-ray were all repeated and showed no evidence of infection.
Her wound was re- evaluated.
The dressing was removed and this was thought not to be a source of infection and an abdominal series was obtained and ruled out evidence of perforation or abscess and a CMV viral load was found to be negative.
Ultimately, the patient subsequently developed a diffuse macular papular rash classic for a drug rash.
In addition, her eosinophils increased to 8 percent of her diff, thus the patient's fever likely is a drug fever, most likely due to vancomycin.
All antibiotics were discontinued and the patient showed some improvement in her rash and she was thought to be stable for discharge on [**2125-6-25**] with close follow up by her primary care doctors.
The patient is still having fevers due to drug reaction, diarrhea much improved, tolerating a regular diet, persistent drug rash.
