He was not anti-coagulated because of his recent gastrointestinal bleed.
Pulmonary:  He had a right base pneumonia present on chest x-ray and Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive sputum.
Cardiac:  He was in atrial fibrillation and off anti-coagulation because of his recent gastrointestinal bleed.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient continued to do well, largely receiving no interventions from us.
A repeat echocardiogram was done which showed persistently depressed left ventricular function.
Given this low left ventricular function in the presence of an elevated troponin on admission is most likely that the patient is status post myocardial infarction and has had an infarction in the past.
Atrial fibrillation.
Aspiration pneumonia.
