Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Arterial monitoring line.
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old male with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and recent right MCA stroke s/p trach and peg who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with worsening shorness of breath for one day.
The patient was noted to be short of breath on the morning of presentation and this worsened throughout the day.
Per report he was noted this afternoon to have acute onset of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response this afternoon.
In this setting he was noted to have irregular respirations with periords of apnea.
ABG drawn at that time was notable for a respiratory alkalosis and hypoxemia 7.58/32/55 on FiO2 50%.
CXR per report showed a consolidation and was given vancomycin and zosyn.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with ST depression in V3.
CXR showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities and mild congestion.
He was placed on positive pressure ventilation with improvement of his respiratory status.

Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar opacities which likely represent atelectasis, but infection is not excluded.
Mild pulmonary edema.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated LV with severe global hypokinesis.
Focal hypokinesis of the RV apex.
Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.
Lung volumes are larger compared to the previous study, and positional differences limit comparison.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged allowing for these factors.
Persistent left retrocardiac opacity, likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 year old male with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and recent right MCA stroke status-post tracheostomy and PEG-tube who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with worsening shorness of breath for one day and CXR consistent with CHF.
Shortness of breath: Differential diagnosis includes systolic congestive heart failure versus infection.
Currently afebrile with mildly elevated WBC and no significant increase in tracheal secretions.
Chest x-ray shows evidence of congestion with large left sided effusion and small right sided effusion.
Low suspicion at this time for cardiac ischemia and cardiac enzymes did not suggest acute infarct.
In addition, he was started on Digoxin for systolic heart failure and his dose of Metoprolol does reduced.
Atrial Fibrillation:  His heart rate was generally 70-100 although he has periods of rapid ventricular response.
During the first day with episodes of RVR to 180?????
?s, he was started on an esmolol gtt which was then weaned off without complications.
His Coumadin was initially held due to supratherapeutic INR but was restarted at discharge.
Evidence of congestive failure on exam.
Magnesium Hydroxide 800 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ml PO once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: -Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with difficulty breathing and found to be fluid overloaded due to systolic congestive heart failure.
Lasix should be continued to remove fluid and ventilator should be weaned to previous settings.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have temperature greater than 101, shortness of breath, worsening difficulty with swallowing, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or any other symptoms that you are concerned about.
