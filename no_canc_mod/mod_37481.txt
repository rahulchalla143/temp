No recent seizures noted, although sister has apparently been titrating patient's dilantin "to somnolence" at home.
Her labs showed leukocytosis with left shift, UA was positive although urine culture later came back negative.
Multiple admissions for toxic metabolic encephalopathy- extensively worked up with MRI, EEG, and neurologic consultations.

Micro: Urine culture - NGTD Blood x 2from admission [**8-10**] - MRSA, surveillance cultures [**Date range (1) 102796**] with NGTD HD catheter tip: No growth .
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly without evidence of pneumonia or overt CHF.
No intra-abdominal source for infection identified with no evidence of abscess or colitis.
Small amount of pericholecystic fluid with cholelithiasis.
No associated inflammation of the gallbladder or gallbladder wall edema to suggest acute cholecystitis.
Mild inflammatory changes about the anus compatible with proctitis.
New nonocclusive thrombus within the left internal jugular vein.
CT HEAD [**8-11**]: Slight prominence of subdural spaces at the convexity is more prominent than the previous studies.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 89279**] is an 80F with a PMH s/f ESRD on HD, who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-10**] with fevers, leukocytosis, dilantin toxicity and altered mental status.
Fever - Initially the source of fever was unclear.
In the MICU, patient was started on meningitis doses of vanco and ceftriaxone given her significantly altered mental status, and flagyl for the abdominal CT findings.
Then blood cultures grew 4/4 bottles of GPCs which were eventually found to be MRSA, and a CXR later showed findings of pneumonia.
An echocardiogram confirmed the absence of vegetations, and the source of the MRSA bacteremia was felt to be related to her HD line.
Altered mental status - Her mental status declined from a baseline of walking ~18 steps, feeding herself, interacting with family, with orientation only to self to minimally responsive to painful stimulus.
Most likely this admission's altered mental status was related to the bacteremia and dilantin toxicity.
Subdural hematoma was found to be stable on CT head, so it was deemed to be an unlikely etiology.
An EEG was consistent with severe encephalopathy.
Eventually the patient's neurosurgeon came to talk to the team, and recommended stopping the dilantin all together, as it was not clear that she had a true underlying seizure disorder.
HD line associated Left upper extremity DVT - Per sister's observations while patient was in the MICU.
Upper extremity Doppler ultrasound ordered and found to be negative for thrombotic process.
Ultrasound showed a DVT in the left internal jugular so patient was started on heparin.
Hypertension - Patient was initially normotensive in the MICU but steadily became increasingly hypertensive (SBP 180s --> 210s during hemodialysis).
CAD - Patient was continued on home aspirin and statin.
During hemodialysis on [**2114-8-16**], 4 liters of fluid was taken off so Nutrition was consulted regarding concentrating her tubefeeds to minimize fluid intake.
PPx: Bowel regimen, heparin SQ was discontinued [**2114-8-13**] when patient found to be hypertensive, bradycardic with concern for increased intracranial pressure --> pneumoboots .

Toxic metabolic encephalopathy   Discharge Condition: -Afebrile -Hemodynamically stable, blood pressures are frequently elevated in the 180 systolic range around [**Hospital6 2286**] days -Able to respond to verbal stimuli- opens eyes on command, shakes head yes/no, mouths words.
-Needs frequent suctioning -Rectal tube in place -HD line site with bleeding secondary to heparin (no on hold), pressure dressing in place.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fevers and altered mental status, which we think is secondary to an hemodyalysis line infection, pneumonia, and dilantin toxicity.
If your fevers return, or if your mental status further deteriorates, please seek medical attention immediately.
