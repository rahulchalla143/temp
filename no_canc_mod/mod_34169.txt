He had a CT on [**2104-5-21**] showing a perforated sigmoid diverticular abscess with involvement of the bladder wall.
He had a cystoscopy on [**2104-5-23**], which showed a likely colovesicular fistular at the bladder dome, as well as a small lesion at the trigone, which was biopsied and found to be nonmalignant, reactive urithelium.
His hospital course was complicated by continued fever, perisepsis, and a subsequent NSTEMI due to demand ischemia.
On [**2104-5-26**], he spiked a fever up to 104 F and became tachycardic to at least [**Street Address(2) 81205**] changes.
He never had any overt chest pain.
He also developed [**Last Name (un) **] without significant oliguria, likely due to ischemic ATN.
His antibiotics were changed to Zosyn in the setting of his worsening condition on [**2104-5-28**], and his clinical status slowly improved.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2104-6-3**] for further cardiac workup and possible fistula repair surgery.
On arrival to the floor he was clear, coherent, and chest pain free with vitals of T 98.5, BP 187/97, HR 74, RR 20, and SpO2 99% on 4L NC.
Blood pressures were reportedly as high as 200/100 at the OSH, and he was reportedly on an Esmolol drip for a brief period, but later titrated to Metoprolol 200 mg PO BID.
On review of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denied any exertional buttock or calf pain.
He did report diarrhea and foul cloudy brown urine.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for the absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

-- In [**2103-3-29**], he had a repeat cath for progressive repeated angina.
He also had diffuse (60-70%) proximal LCX disease and reported 3VD.
OSH IMAGING: Abdominal CT - colovesicular fistula likely secondary to sigmoid divericuli.
Nuclear imaging revealed an inferior wall MI, mild ischemia in the in the mid to basal septum, inferior and septal hypokinesis, LV systolic dysfunction and an EF of 45%.
Echocardiogram ([**2103-1-2**]): Echocardiogram from [**2103-1-2**] revealed a slightly enlarged LA and aortic root, normal systolic function of both ventricles, and LVEF of 75%.
CARDIAC CATH ([**1-/2103**]): PTCA COMMENTS: Initial angiography showed recurrent severe (80-90%) ostial LCX stenosis followed by diffuse (60-70%) proximal LCX disease.
A 4.0 XB guide provided excellent support and a Choice PT Extra Support wire crossed the lesion without difficulty.
We then delivered a 3.0x15 mm Endeavor DES at 18 ATM, post-dilated with 3.0x15 mm Quantum Maverick at 20 ATM and 3.5x8 mm Quantum Maverick at 10 ATM.

Radiology Report RENAL U.S. Study Date of [**2104-6-8**] 2:56 PM HISTORY: Colovesicular fistula with acute kidney failure with recent sepsis, evaluate for abscess or obstruction.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, solid renal masses or renal calculi.
There is no evidence of perinephric fluid collection.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis or solid renal masses.
[**2104-6-15**] CT Abd : Progression of segmental diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon with regional focal contained perforation.
No free air in the upper abdomen or drainable collections.
Exophytic sigmoid diverticulum is increasingly decompressed with an air-fluid level and communication with the urinary bladder is less well visualized given urinary bladder decompression with foley catheter.
Cholelithiasis unchanged.
[**2104-6-16**] Video swallow : No gross aspiration or penetration seen.
No evidence of obstruction or extravasation.
He had a CT on [**2104-5-21**] showing a perforated sigmoid diverticular abscess with involvement of the bladder wall.
He had a cystoscopy on [**2104-5-23**], which showed a likely colovesicular fistular at the bladder dome, as well as a small lesion at the trigone, which was biopsied and found to be nonmalignant, reactive urithelium.
His hospital course was complicated by continued fever, sepsis, and a subsequent NSTEMI due to demand ischemia with a Troponin of 1.57 at its peak.
He also developed [**Last Name (un) **], likely due to ischemic ATN, with a peak Cr 4.3 on [**2104-5-31**].
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac workup and fistula repair surgery.
# Perisepsis/Colovesicular Fistula:  Patient has a known nidus of infection through his fistula.
Patient was febrile as high as 104F with tachycardia at OSH, though he has been afebrile on Zosyn since the 14th.
Blood and urine cultures showed no growth.
# Enzyme leak/NSTEMI:  This patient has an excellent story and setting for demand ischemia, given his underlying known CAD, high heart rate, and fevers.
Echo on [**2104-6-4**] showed probable inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis with an LVEF of 45-50%.
Given his active renal failure and overall more pressing issues, aggressive medical optimization outweighed cardiac cath.
He was increased to full dose Aspirin and his other cardiac medications were continued except for his ACE inhibitor, which was held due to his reduced renal function.
# HTN: He had elevated blood pressures up to SBP 200 at OSH.
In the setting of recent demand ischemia, he needed agressive but cautious BP control.
He continued to have elevated BP, so Hydralazine 25 mg PO Q6H was added with some improvement.
On [**2104-6-11**], his Nitro Patch was increased to 0.4 mg/hr due to his BP rising somewhat over the prior few days.
His [**Last Name (un) **] is most likely due to ischemic ATN in the setting of perisepsis, with a possible component of AIN from multiple antibiotics, though this is less likely.
His urine was positive for rare eosinophils.
Renal US on [**2104-6-8**] did not show any evidence of obstruction or abscess.
Renal consult agreed with the diagnosis of ATN and was following.
The anemia workup was consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
GI bleeding was a concern given his history of diverticulosis and recent guaiac positive stools.
After starting IV fluids on [**2104-6-8**], his Hct dropped to 28.6, likely due to hemodilution.
His Hct stayed below 30 on subsequent labs, and he was given 1 unit of blood on [**2104-6-9**], with a smaller Hct increase than expected.
Urine leakage into the colon from his fistula was another possible contributing factor.
# Bladder Spasm: He did not complain of bladder spasm since admission and did not need the Oxybutinin.
# Diabetes: His diabetes was only borderline prior to admission.
# FEN/Lytes: On admission, the patient was NPO with an NG tube and was receiving TPN for bowel rest in setting of his fistula.
He had some loose stools after starting a liquid diet, but this improved after starting a regular diet.
Pt's post-extubation course was largely unremarkable with excellent pain control, nutritional support, continued dvt and pud prophylaxis, and improving physical exam and clinical picture.

Disp:*180 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 2203**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Colovesicular Fistula Acute Tubular Necrosis Diverticulitis Hypertension Contusion nasopharynx and oropharynx.
Secondary Diagnoses: Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Coronary Artery Disease Diabetes Mellitus Type II Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Diverticulosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital to be evaluated for possible repair of your colovesicular fistula, an abnormal connection which developed between your colon and bladder.
Prior to your admission here, you developed a serious infection which put strain on your heart and caused a type of heart attack called a Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI).
Your recent illness also put strain on your kidneys, and caused a type of damage called Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN).
You also had some kidney dysfunction after you were treated with Meropenum, an antibiotic used to treat diverticulitis.
The surgery was scheduled for Thursday [**2104-6-12**] but due to issues in the Operating Room inserting a nasogastric tube the surgery was cancelled and the ENT service performed an endoscopic examination to assess your anatomy for any abnormalities or injuries during the attempted nasogastric tube placement.
You developed acute diverticulitis on [**2104-6-15**] and it has taken a few days for your abdominal pain to resolve.
You can now be on a low residue diet and you will stay on suppressive antibiotic therapy until your elective operation which will be 3-5 months down the road as long as you remain free of any abdominal pain.
