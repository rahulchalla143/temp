Name:  [**Known lastname 8232**], [**Known firstname **]                  Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 8233**]  Admission Date:  [**2135-10-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2135-10-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-7-13**]     Sex:  M  Service:  ADDENDUM:   The patient is a 72-year-old male with a known history of 3-vessel coronary artery disease who was transferred from an outside hospital for coronary artery bypass grafting after a positive exercise treadmill test and a catheterization which showed 3-vessel disease and an ejection fraction of 25%.
The patient did state that he suffered similar syncopal episodes about once per week while at home, and they would usually occur when he had an over-full bladder and was attempting to void.
The patient was already expected to undergo a workup for a pacemaker, and this event will obviously factor into the decision to proceed with placement.
