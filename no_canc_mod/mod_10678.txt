There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with HTN, diastolic CHF, asthma, admitted to OSH with GNR bacteremia with cholesytitis, cholangitis, and gallstone pancreatitis, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] following unsuccessful ERCP complicated by A. fib with RVR.
Likely source of GNR bacteremia is cholecysitis/cholangitis.
Patient's BP remained stable though patient was initially tachcyardic in setting of A. fib with RVR, now resolved with diltiazem.
Patient admitted to OSH with elevated LFTs, abdominal pain, and [**Name (NI) 5283**] sono consistent with cholecystitis.
Given that LFTs were consistent with an obstructive picture, an ERCP was performed on [**2114-4-17**].
Source of GNR bacteremia was thought to be from a biliary source.
Surgery was done without complications.
She was initially hydrated with IVFs, kept NPO, and her pain managed with morphine.
Surgery was done without complications.
Developed A.fib with RVR in setting of procedure, which resolved initially after diltiazem drip and continuation on diltiazem 30 PO [**Month/Day (3) **] but returned x5hrs on floor, with spontaneous return to SR.
With Diltiazem 30mg PO [**Name9 (PRE) **] patient heart rate continue to be sinus rhythm with occasional PACs.
Kept on HISS and monitored fingersticks.
Echo demonstrated elevated LV filling pressures with preserved EF (70-80%) and no wall motion abnormalities.
During hospitalization patient didn't demonstrate any symptoms of CHF exacerbation.
Lung x-ray was grossly normal, patient has trace lower extremities edema.
Patient denies SOB or DOE.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a diabetic regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
ProAir HFA 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Incision Care: *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site.
*You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.
