Mother had a cerclage placed, but developed preterm labor.
Rupture of membranes at delivery.
Clear breath sounds with mild retraction.
Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, with no hepatosplenomegaly.
She never had any     apnea of prematurity.
She continues to     be slightly jaundiced with no treatment necessary.
The baby was started off in an isolette and     was taken out of the isolette on day of life 11 and has     had a stable temperature since that time.
They found diffuse dry, scaly,     erythematous skin with fissures consistent with the     findings of a collodion baby.
Collodion membranes are     nonspecific and can be seen in many different     conditions, including congenital ichthyotic disorders.
Her mother has a history of ichthyosis vulgaris and the     patient may very well have ichthyosis vulgaris     presenting as a collodion.
Other causes include     idiopathic collodion, lamellar ichthyosis, ichthyosis     vulgaris and X-linked ichthyosis.
They recommend     liberal emollients which we are using Aquaphor Cream     twice a day to the entire skin surface to prevent     further fissuring that could predispose the patient to     infection and sepsis and a follow-up appointment with     dermatology, which is scheduled for [**10-11**].
2)      Born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of the following:      day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household,      neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or school-      age siblings, chronic lung disease, hemodynamically      significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age (and for the first 24 months of      the child's life), immunization against influenza is      recommended for household contacts and out of home      caregivers.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends initial      vaccination of preterm infants at or following      discharge from the hospital if they are clinically      stable and at least 6 weeks, but fewer than 12 weeks of      age.
