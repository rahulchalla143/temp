Admission Date:  [**2102-7-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2102-8-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2057-11-20**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44-year-old female with multiple sclerosis and a history of tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement in [**2093**] who developed hematuria one day prior to admission.
The patient became hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 80% and a respiratory rate of 20.
Attempts to bag the patient with AMBI bag, but ventilation was ineffective secondary to no cuff in the trachea.
A chest x-ray revealed no infiltrates seen.
The neck examination revealed a tracheostomy with no erythema or exudate.
No murmurs or rubs.
Lung examination revealed very shallow quick breaths and a few scattered bronchial sounds.
No decubitus ulcerations.
Urinalysis revealed large amounts of blood, 500 mg/dL of protein, and moderate leukocytes, more than 50 red blood cells, more than 50 white blood cells, a few bacteria, and no yeast.
Microbiology history:  In [**2101-10-11**], there was a urine cultures which grew out Pseudomonas which was sensitive to everything but ciprofloxacin (which it was resistant to).
It also grew out pan-sensitive enterococcus.
In [**2100**], urine culture grew out pan-sensitive enterococcus.
In [**2099**], urine culture grew out ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, cefuroxime intermediate and Pseudomonas resistant to ciprofloxacin.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING: A chest x-ray revealed a left lower lobe streak ?.
Electrocardiogram revealed no acute ST-T wave changes per baseline.
HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  Hypotension most likely due to urosepsis with a urinalysis showing a high white blood cells and moderate leukocyte esterase with a white blood cell count of 36.2.
Urinalysis showed signs of urinary tract infection.
Urine culture from the [**7-29**] grew out enterococcus pan-sensitive to ampicillin, levofloxacin, and vancomycin.
The patient was originally started on vancomycin to treat enterococcus until these sensitivities came back from enterococcus being sensitive to ampicillin.
Urosepsis resolving, and the patient was afebrile throughout her hospital course.
There was a question of a fistula in the urinary system; however, Urology was consulted and upon the methylene blue study there was found to be no vesicovaginal fistula.
The patient received a computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast which did not show any signs of free fluid or abscess collection.
The patient went to the operating room on [**8-2**] for a trachea change.
Additionally, sputum from [**7-29**] grew out Pseudomonas sensitive to everything but ciprofloxacin.
The patient received a computed tomography of the trachea without contrast and with reconstruction prior to going to the operating room for tracheostomy removal and replacement with a new tracheostomy.
ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient's hematocrit was 44.4 on admission and dropped to 34.8 on the same day of admission; progressively decreasing to 31.7 on [**8-2**].
No signs of active bleeding.
Most likely due to blood draws.
This was most likely due to hypovolemia as the patient's sodium level responded to intravenous infusion of normal saline.
The patient was to be evaluated today for a peripherally inserted central catheter placement to complete a 14-day course of ampicillin for enterococcus and ceftazidime for Pseudomonas.
Respiratory distress with urosepsis enterococcus.
Tracheobronchitis Pseudomonas.
