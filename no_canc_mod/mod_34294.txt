There is associated mass effect with effacement of the left lateral ventricle and rightward subfalcine herniation by approximately 3.5 mm.
Probable chronic subdural along the right frontal lobe.
CT cspine: no fracture.
CT torso: no traumatic injury:  Small area of consolidation at base of left lower lobe probably aspiration.
CT Head [**11-25**]: FINDINGS:  Again demonstrated is extensive left subdural hemorrhage with no significant change.
There is mass effect on the left lateral ventricle, effacement of its occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and effacement of the cerebral sulci on the left side.
Note is made of a small amount of blood layering within the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] present on prior study however more conspicuous today.
A large focal hypodensity, 4.8x2.3cm in the anterior right middle cranial fossa probably represents an arachnoid cyst with scalloping and thinning of the adjacent squamous temporal bone and displacement of the temporal lobe posteriorly.
([**2-12**])  A nasal bone deformity likely represents prior trauma and is unchanged.
There is no evidence of acute fracture.
Moderate opacification is noted  within the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses.
Small amount of blood within the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], more conspicuous than prior study.
Stable rightward subfalcine herniation, 3 mm, mass effect on the left lateral ventricle, effacement of left occipital horna nd cerebral sulci.
Large, 4.8x2.3cm extra-axial hypodensity in the right anterior middle cranial fossa, with scalloping and thinning of adjacent squamous temporal bone, and posterior displacement of the temporal lobe likely represents cyst- arachnoid/epidermoid cyst.
Moderate sinus disease, as described above.
Left subdural hemorrhage is decreased in extent, although a moderate amount of dense subdural blood does remain, predominantly posteriorly, and this also tracks inferiorly along the left tentorium.
Slight rightward subfalcine herniation, and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle is unchanged.
A small amount of layering blood in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle is unchanged.
Focal hypodensity in the anterior right middle cranial fossa is unchanged, completely described on prior exams, and most consistent with an arachnoid cyst.
IMPRESSION:  Status post left frontal craniotomy, with expected post-surgical change, and some interval decrease in left subdural hemorrhage.
CT Head [**11-28**]: NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD:  Post left frontal craniotomy changes with reduced left frontal pneumocephalus and persistent mixed attenuation left convexity and left tentorial subdural hemorrhage, measuring at most 9mm from the inner table with mild mass effect on the left lateral ventricle is grossly unchanged since [**2199-11-25**].
There is no midline shift.
A right frontal hypodensity likely represents old subdural hemorrhage, unchanged since [**2199-11-23**].
A focal hypodensity along the anterior right middle cranial fossa with scalloping of the adjacent bone is likely an arachnoid cyst, unchanged since [**2199-11-23**].
Moderate opacification of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses is unchanged since [**2199-11-25**].
IMPRESSION:  Left frontal craniotomy changes and left convexity subdural hematoma are grossly unchanged since [**2199-11-25**].
Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 14840**] is a 48 y/o M who was initially seen at a referring institution for falling and having a witnessed generalized seizure.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with a left acute subdural hematoma.
He went to the OR for an evacuation of the hematoma on HD 3.
Prior to discharge, the patient had no neurologic deficits.
He had no problems with vomiting during his stay.
He did have some episodes of nausea which resolved before he was discharged home.
GU: The patient had no problems with this system during this hospitalization.
FEN: Mr. [**Known lastname 14840**] had some problems regarding his serum sodium and serum potassium being too low.
However, these values corrected with minimal supplementation.
HEME: The patient had no problems with bleeding or hemostasis during this hospitalization.
ID: The patient had no problems with this system during this hospitalization.
