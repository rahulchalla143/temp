Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 37 year old male with h/o pancreatitis who presents with necrotizing pancreatitis, now with delirium suspected [**1-11**] alcohol withdrawal, although pt and family deny alcohol use.
1)Necrotizing pancreatitis - 40% necrotized on admission CT scan to our institution, with preservation of pancreatic head and tail.
Possible etiologies include ETOH, gallstones (none seen on admission CT scan), obstruction (ruled-out with RUQ u/s), hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides only mildly elevated in 200s), hypercalcemia, drugs (unlikely; pt only taking atenolol at home), infection, and trauma (no history of trauma).
Repeat CT showed overall improved appearance of pancreas although there is some organization of pancreatic inflammation.
He also completed a 7d course of Meropenem for necrotizing pancreatitis.
2)Fevers: Patient presented with persistent fevers throughout his hospital stay.
Both pancreatitis and withdrawal can cause fever.
Ruled out acalculous cholecystitis with RUQ US.
ETOH withdrawal:  Per psychiatric evaluation and high benzodiazepine requirement, acute mental status changes likely secondary to EtOH withdrawal.
Constellation of symptoms includes tachycardia, tremulousness, agitation, coupled with a history of recurrent pancreatitis.
Head CT without intracranial abnormalities.
4)Respiratory: On admission, patient was tachypneic despite large doses of BZDs for withdrawal and as a result, was electively intubated.
Cxray showed large L pleural effusion, likely secondary to pancreatitis.
5)Hyperglycemia: Likely new onset diabetes secondary to necrosis of his pancreatic beta cells.
Now with new insulin requirement > 100 units per day while on TPN.
He was initially maintained on insulin gtt with increasing requirements but was transitioned to a sliding scale as his clinical status improved.
