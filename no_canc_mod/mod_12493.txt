Admission Date:  [**2163-2-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-2-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2118-6-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**] Chief Complaint: Body aches  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 44 year-old woman with history of sickle cell disease and breast cancer admitted with body aches, fever, and sinus congestion for one day.
Per patient she was in her usual state of health until the day of admission when she developed subjective fever after her shower.
Then she developed pain all over her body more severe than anything she has ever experienced before.
Tachypneic in ED so coming to unit.
CTA negative for PE but did see infarcts in lung and cannot tell if acute or chronic.
No infiltrate.
Because she spiked a fever 102.1 and respiratory distress she was admitted to the ICU.
She has no history of sickle cell crisis.
Review of sytems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies recent weight loss or gain.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
- Homzygous SS Sickle Cell Disease (followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]hematocrit range 19.5-23.1 and never been symptomatic per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] note [**9-17**] - Hyposplenism with "diminutive" spleen on CT Abd [**2159**] - S/p appendectomy - Biliary colic - S/p tubal ligation - Ovarian cyst - never had repeat u/s - Shoulder injury  Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname **] works at the [**Hospital1 18**] on CC7.
She has no history of STDs, no history of abnormal Pap smears.
She does not report heavy or uncomfortable menses.
Family History: The patient believes that both of her parents had sickle cell trait.
She has 3 brothers, none of whom have sickle cell trait or disease.
She also has 3 sisters, one of which does not have sickle cell trait or disease, one of which has sickle cell trait, and one of which had sickle cell disease and has subsequently passed away.
She also reports that her niece recently died of sickle cell disease.
She had not been with her father who lived in [**Country 2045**] while he was alive since her last PPD testing, so no recent exposure to a patient with active TB that she knows of.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T:99.5 BP:112/58 P:81 R: 26 O2:95% 2LNC General: Alert, oriented, in pain and slightly tachypneic from pain HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry MM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, [**1-15**] SM LLSB Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Pertinent Results: [**2163-2-18**] LACTATE-1.4 UREA N-11 CREAT-1.1 SODIUM-138 POTASSIUM-4.3 CHLORIDE-108 TOTAL CO2-23 ALT(SGPT)-24 AST(SGOT)-35 LD(LDH)-216 ALKP-70 TBILI-2.3* DBILI-0.5* INDIR BIL-1.8 LIPASE-25 WBC-13.4*# RBC-1.79* HGB-6.7* HCT-19.8* MCV-111* RDW-17.4* NEUTS-89* BANDS-1 LYMPHS-3* MONOS-7 EOS-0 BASOS-0 ATYPS-0 METAS-0 MYELOS-0 NUC RBCS-2* calTIBC-138* VitB12-221* Hapto-19* TRF-106*  EKG: NSR with normal axis and intervals, wavy baseline but no significant ST/TW changes  CXR [**2163-2-19**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
CTA [**2163-2-19**]: No PE, although motion limits assessment of distal subsegmental vessels.
Multiple small peripheral opacities consistent with infarcts typical for sickle disease; acuity of these unknown without prior exam.
Enlarged pulmonary artery indicating pulmonary arterial hypertension.
LE U/S [**2163-2-19**]:  No evidence for DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
ECHO [**2163-2-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-9-29**], the right ventricle is mildly dilated/hypokinetic with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 44 year-old woman history of SS sickle cell disease admitted with flu-like illness and first sickle cell crisis that was likely triggered from a respiratory infection and dehydration.
# Flu-like Illness: Symptoms consistent with acute flu-like illness.
Given her asplenism and risk for fulminant infection she was started on abx while awaiting culture results including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and tamiflu.
Pt treated empirically for PNA with Ceftriaxone(changed to Cefpodoxime on discharge) and Azithromycin for 7 days.
# Sickle Cell Crisis:  Hematology was consulted given question of acute chest syndrome and potential need for exchange transfusion or hydroxyurea.
CT chest was reviewed with hematology and consensus was that findings were chronic and not consistent with acute chest syndrome.
Crisis continued to be treated with IVF, oxygen therapy and good pain control.
The patient was pain free and with good oxygen saturation when breathing room air both at rest and with ambulation on the day of discharge.
# Pulmonary artery hypertension: CT Chest and Echocardiogram both confirm PA hypertension.
PA hypertension is a common complication seen in Sickle Cell Crisis from chronic hemolysis.
A repeat Echocardiogram should be performed as an outpatient to evaluate for interval change after sickle cell crisis has resolved.
# Echo report read as consistent with pulmonary embolism, but the findings of RV failure and pulmonary hypertension is also consistent with vaso occlusive crisis from sickle cell crisis.
CTA did not reveal central or segmental PEs.
The small filling defect seen in the right posterior lower lobe subsegmental vessel would be too small of a PE to cause such profound pulmonary HTN.
