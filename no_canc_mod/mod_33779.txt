No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with infero-lateral hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apex as well as the apical and mid portions of the inferior wall..
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
POST BYPASS 1.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
There is some atelectasis at the left base.
She was started on Bactrim for a positive urinalysis which eventually grew out Klebseilla pneumoniae and Citrobacter.
She was also seen by the wound service given her left lower extremity ulcers.
There was no evidence of cellulitis, and she required only local wound care measures.
She experienced rapid atrial fibrillation which was initially treated with Amiodarone and beta blockade, along with electrolyte replacement.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
