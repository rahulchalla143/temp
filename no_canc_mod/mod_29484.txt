At that time he had hypotension, bradycardia, altered mental status which was thought to be secondary to urinary tract infection and medication effect.
He improved with treatment of UTI and decrease in methadone and diltiazem doses.
He presented to an OSH and with altered mental status.
It was deemed that he was in hypercarbic respiratory failure and intubated.
CT head negative for acute pathology.
CTAP without acute findings with bibasilar atelectasis.
CXR without consolidation.
Past Medical History: - Anterior Cervical Diskectomy and Fusion C3-6 for cord edema in setting of fall (8ft from ladder) and subsequent quadriplegia, C6 level clinically - indwelling suprapubic catheter - s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] IVC filter [**2130**] - s/p baclofen pump - COPD - OSA   Social History: Lives in [**Location 32944**] MA with his wife and son.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 93.3, HR 47, BP 110/66, RR 16, 98% intubated General: Intubated, sedated, not responsive HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Bradycardic, regular, S1, S2, no m/r/g Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi, anterior examination Abdomen: soft, non-distended, bowel sounds present, suprapubic catheter in place GU: no foley Ext: Warm, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: unable to assess Skin: Rash on face, irritation from shaving?
Brief Hospital Course: 46-year-old male with quadraplegia, suprapubic catheter with recurrent UTIs on ciprofloxacin, multiple sedating [**Year/Month/Day 4982**] including methadone and valium presents with altered mental status and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
ICU Course:  Neuro: 1) Altered mental status: Appears consistent with toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
It is unclear if this is post-ictal, infection with delirium, hypercapnea or medication effect.
- neuro consult was obtained on [**2136-5-26**] and was started on LTM which revealed generalized spike wave as well as left hemisphere discharges and he had an event with right gaze deviation and body stiffening, unresponsiveness.
While on the floor, he did not have any further episodes of seizures.
His EEG did show "a few detections of paroxysmal potential epileptiform transients.
This activity was seen in a generalized distribution but also a distribution that favored the left central region", over the next two days after Keppra was started, his EEG did show some improvement and he clinically improved so his leads were taken off on [**2136-5-28**].
He also had an MRI on [**2136-5-29**] to look for an underlying seizure focus.
Pain: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a baclofen pump in place and due to his MRI, the pain service was consulted.
Also with some hypoxemia on arrival.
Based on CXR and CTAP may be due to atelectasis.
Also possible muscle weakness possible.
No clear evidence of COPD exacerbation.
He was initially intubated upon arrival and therefore admitted to the ICU, he was weaned from the vent and extubated without difficulty.
When stable he was transferred to the floor and did not have any further respiratory distress.
Whether treatment was required was discussed with ID as this may be a colonization and it was felt that since the pt is now clinically asymptomatic, has no pain and is clinically doing well, treatment can be deferred.
[**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to neurologic status.
No cardiac issues after transfer to the floor.
Hypotension: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has some history of hypotension with previous admissions, (most recently at the end of [**Month (only) 547**]) and has required Midodrine.
