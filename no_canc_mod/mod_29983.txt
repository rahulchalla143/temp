Interpretation assigned to [**Name6 (MD) 15425**] [**Name8 (MD) 15426**], MD, Interpreting physician    Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 71 year old male with a history of multiple revisions of pace-maker, coronary artery disease, chronic systolic congestive heart failure-?acute on chronic systolic CHF, and bipolar disorder who presents from [**State **] for evaluation of non-healing wound and likely pacemaker revision.
Non-healing wound, pacemaker: Patient with first pacer placed [**2054**] cardiomyopathy secondary to myocarditis.
This was an abdominal pacemaker and his course was complicated by infection; patient reportedly has a fistula.
Since that time, he has had multiple revisions, with one hematoma.
He reports that he has had continued drainage and bleeding from his chest wall abnormality that is concerning for persistent infection (either abscess, infected new or old wires that are in place) in setting of sinus tract.
He has had no fevers, chills, or other features to suggest systemic disease.
An ECHO was obtained which showed no vegetation.
Mr.[**Name14 (STitle) 96500**] had postoperative confusion.
No focal defecit.Id following with antibiotic reccommendations->Vanco x 14 days, start date [**11-16**];trough level maintained 15-20.
He was restarted on Coumadin for chronic AFib.
Postoperative delerium continues to improve.
