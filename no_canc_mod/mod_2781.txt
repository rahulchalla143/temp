Admission Date:  [**2186-9-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2186-10-7**]   Service:  C-MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman admitted for sinus bradycardia.
The patient went to see his primary care physician (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) on the day of admission with a complaint of ankle swelling for the past one to two months.
There, he was noted to have sinus bradycardia on an electrocardiogram with a rate in the 30s to 40s.
He complains of pain and cramping in the left calf which wakes him from sleep times the past several months.
He requested the patient have a cardiac catheterization for consideration of a pacemaker placement.
Coronary artery disease.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
History of aspiration pneumonia.
History of gastrojejunostomy tube; status post aspiration pneumonia (now removed).
History of abnormal stress test in [**2185-1-11**].
The patient had chest pain and a positive stress test showing a moderate sized inferior wall reversible defect and was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who advised cardiac catheterization at that time.
ALLERGIES:  The patient reports no known drug allergies.
The patient was alert and in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Neck examination revealed no lymphadenopathy.
Bilateral carotid bruits were auscultated.
No wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Lower extremity examination revealed 1+ edema bilaterally.
Groin examination revealed no bruits.
Skin examination revealed no rashes.
He was monitored overnight without any evidence of symptomatic bradycardia.
The catheterization also showed diffuse left circumflex disease.
Status post catheterization, the patient had a vagal episode resulting in his heart rate decreasing to 39 and a systolic blood pressure in the 60s.
There were no electrocardiogram changes noted at this time.
Status post cardiac catheterization, the patient was also noted to have an elevation in his creatine kinase levels to values of 1034; however, the MB fraction was low.
It was felt that this was secondary to difficult hemostasis status post sheath removal after his cardiac catheterization.
In light of this elevation of creatine kinase levels, the patient underwent an ultrasound of his right groin in order to rule out pseudoaneurysm formation.
CAROTID ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient underwent bilateral carotid Doppler ultrasound on [**2186-9-29**].
This showed right internal carotid stenosis of 80% to 99%, left internal carotid artery stenosis of 80% to 99%, and left internal carotid artery stenosis of 70% to 79%.
It was felt that the patient's carotid stenosis could be contributing to his bradycardia.
A magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography of the patient's head and neck was planned to further evaluate his carotid disease, but this was unable to be obtained secondary to the patient's recent coronary artery stent placement.
The patient was seen by the Vascular Surgery Service regarding his asymptomatic carotid stenosis and was felt not to be a surgical candidate in light of his need to continue Plavix for three months status post carotid artery stent placement.
Overall, the patient tolerated the right internal carotid artery stent placement well with no neurologic events.
SINUS BRADYCARDIA ISSUES:  Initially, the patient was admitted for evaluation and likely pacemaker placement.
However, the pacemaker evaluation was postponed pending evaluation of the patient's coronary arteries and carotid arteries.
He was discharged to home on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor in order to further evaluate his heart rate for any evidence of symptomatic bradycardia.
TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  Throughout his hospital stay, the patient was maintained on a regular insulin sliding-scale.
RIGHT LUNG NODULE ISSUES:  The patient had evidence of a right upper lung nodule of 9 mm in diameter.
Per Radiology, it was recommended that the patient undergo a follow-up computed tomography scan in three months in order to assess for interval change.
If an interval change does occur, the patient should undergo an outpatient evaluation of the mass including a possible oncologic workup.
Coronary artery disease.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Anemia secondary to acute blood loss.
