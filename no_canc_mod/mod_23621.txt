Did have BP drop to 70s at OSH, responded to 250 cc bolus.
Trop 0.04 here; ECG faxed to cards who did not feel c/w ischemia and recommended d/c heparin gtt.
ALso noted constipation yesterday.

ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):  BAL: Bronchial lavage: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Pulmonary macrophages and bronchial cells.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Right upper lobe consolidation, with irregular appearance that may signify  underlying mass.
No intracranial hemorrhage or acute intracranial abnormality.
10-mm subgaleal low-attenuation fluid collection, without underlying bony abnormality or inflammatory change in the overlying subcutaneous tissues.
Pansinus disease, with fluid in the right maxillary and sphenoid air cells and complete opacification of right mastoid air cells.
Bibasilar atelectasis and small nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions.
T8 compression fracture of indeterminate chronicity.
Right renal cyst, incompletely characterized.
Probable pulmonary hypertension.
No clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 70F with history of COPD on home O2, HTN, presenting with shortness of breath and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Family gave history of pt being more tired and lethargic x few days PTA, perhaps due to hypoventilation.
Patient with severe COPD at baseline, presenting with hypoxia and ABG showing acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.
Thought to be due to worsening obstructive disease vs. fluid overload vs infection, or intracranial process causing central respiratory depression, as patient's family reported pt had recent fall.
CT head negative for intracranial abnormality.
She was initially treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl for suspected respiratory infection.
She was given one dose of solumedrol 60mg, then started on prednisone 60mg PO daily and standing albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments for suspected COPD exacerbation.
CT chest showed an irregular consolidation in the RUL suggestive of infection vs malignancy.
Sputum gram stain was positive for gram positive cocci in pairs.
# ?Pulmonary Mass: CT and CXR show a ?RUL lung mass concerning for neoplasm.
# Borderline hypotension.
Concern initially for sepsis/severe pneumonia, but was likely due to her hypovolemia given history of poor PO intake.
# Acute Renal Failure: BUN/Cr in ED 69/4.2 (recent past was 1.2 in [**Month (only) **]).
Likely prerenal d/t poor forward flow and hypovolemia.
Urine lytes were suggestive of a pre-renal etiology.
# ECG changes.
Minimal STEs vs. PR depressions on admission.
Troponin was elevated at 0.04 but stable x 3 sets.
Serum CK was mildly elevated at 368 with a CK-MB of 12 on admission and subsequently trended down to CK of 250s and CK-MB of 6.
TTE demonstrated EF 75%, with mild LVH and mild diastolic dysfunction, with no regional wall motion abnormalities.
# Anemia and thrombocytopenia.
Unclear reason for low plts but these normalized to 195 by time of discharge from ICU.
Iron demonstrated low iron, low TIBC, consistent with anemia of chronic disease, and HCT remained stable at 27.
# Osteoporosis On her Chest CT scan, she was noted to have a compression fraction at T8 of unknown duration.
# Deconditioning Given her poor baseline status and intubation, she was evaluated by physical therapy as an inpatient.
Her walking was limited by her breathing and it was felt that she would benefit from inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation after discharge.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.

Hypercarbic respiratory failure 2.
Pneumonia 3.
Possible lung mass 4.
Acute renal failure 5.
Obstructive sleep apnea   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: You were diagnosed with respiratory failure.
This is predominantly due to your chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema) and also in part due to obstructive sleep apnea.
You were ill enough to require intubation and monitoring in the intensive care unit, but have made good improvement since you have been here.
