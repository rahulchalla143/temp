One hour prior to that visit developed acute chest/back pain, which she notified him about.
She was hemodynamically stable, but given extent of symptoms was transferred to the [**Location (un) **] ED for CTA to evaluate for aortic dissection and/or PE.
Per report, CTA notable for large R PE and descending Aortic dissection.
Father had MI in his 70s.
No history of clotting disorders, PE, early MI, SCD, or arrhythmias.

**FINAL REPORT [**2177-5-29**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2177-5-29**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Acute aortic dissection with findings similar to the very recent prior examination aside from the fact that the false lumen is now clearly opacified with contrast.
Although unchanged, there is a small quantity of acute hemorrhage within mediastinal fat suggesting recent bleeding outside of the aortic wall although there is no evidence for change or active extravasation on this examination.
Large pulmonary embolism in the right main pulmonary artery, of indefinite chronicity, but potentially subacute; correlation with clinical course is suggested; the main pulmonary artery is enlarged but right ventricle does not appear enlarged.
Large right-sided thyroid nodule for which further assessment with ultrasound is recommended when clinically appropriate.
Large hiatal hernia.
Radiology Report BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2177-5-26**] 8:53 PM IMPRESSION:  No bilateral lower extremity DVT.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2177-5-27**] at 11:09:04 AM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate aortic stenosis.
Moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Worsening bilateral pleural effusions, particularly on the left, now with complete left lower lobe collapse and atelectasis in the left upper and right lower lobes.
Large hiatal hernia.
Both drips were titrated carefully for therapeutic control.
LENIs were negative for DVTs.
Transthoracic Echo showed moderate aortic stenosis, moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
Repeat CTA/CTV showed stable dissection and PE, with no signs of pelvic mass.
She was initiated on coumadin, and remained on a heparin drip until a therpeutic INR was reached.
She worked with PT and was found to be a rehab candidate.
She tolerated a regular diet, and voided without difficulty.
Of note, a thyroid nodule was seen on both CT scans, and follow up with PCP is [**Name Initial (PRE) 9304**].
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a Type B Aortic Dissection and a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the right main pulmonary artery).
While reviewing your CT scan, there was a thyroid nodule noted.
