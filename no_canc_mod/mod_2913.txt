Marked splenomegaly  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 9935**] is a 56 year-old gentleman w/ HCV cirrhosis complicated by recurrent varices s/p banding and thrombocytopenia who presented with bright red blood per rectum in the setting of 2 episodes of epistaxis.
Due to his history of esophageal varices, he was initially admitted to the ICU given concern for variceal bleed.
He had upper endoscopy while in the ICU which showed no evidence of variceal bleed, but showed portal hypertensive gastropathy and erosions in the stomach body and antrum.
There was no definitive source of upper GI bleeding found.
Since his hematocrit was stable and there were no further episodes of bleeding, he was discharged with close GI follow-up.
