You had no further episodes of bleeding, and never needed to be transfused.
You had an endoscopy done which showed inflammation of your esophagus and stomach, with stomach and esophagus ulcers.
It also showed a tear in your esophagus, which may be the reason for your bleeding.
You should talk with your cardiologist about whether you need to restart this after you have your second endoscopy with the GI specialists to ensure there is no more bleeding.
