A`coronary angiogram had non obstructive coronary artery disease.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
An ACE-I was started for hypertension management.
He continued with issues with hypertension so he was transitioned to HCTZ and lasix was stopped, additionally he was taken off lopressor and placed on carvedilol for chronic sytolic heart failure and hypertension with good response.
