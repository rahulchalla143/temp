Large right temporal intraparenchymal hematoma along with foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe and in the right frontal cortex with some surrounding edema and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and effacement of the cerebral sulci.
No obvious aneurysm noted in the major intracranial arteries imaged.
While the hematoma can related to etiology like amyloid angiopathy with predominantly lobar hemorrhage, any vascular or mass lesion obscured by the hematoma itself cannot be adequately assessed on the present study.
Close followup evaluation, is necessary, to assess for interval change.
Head CT: IMPRESSION: No significant change in size of a large right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema and mass effect.
Smaller foci of right-sided subarachnoid hemorrhage are also unchanged.
Video Swallow: Patient is noted with decreased alertness compared to his evaluation on [**4-1**].
Patient was noted with decreased alertness during today's evaluation.
Patient was noted with throat clearing and wet vocal quality after all PO trials and a weak, delayed cough after thin liquid.
This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of Level 1, NPO  [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname **] [**Age over 90 82698**] M  86  [**2032-1-28**]  Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2118-3-31**] 10:26 PM   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] J.

Unchanged small right sided foci of subarrachnoid hemorrhage.
Final Report INDICATION: 86-year-old male with large right intraparenchymal temporal hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: Evaluation is somewhat limited secondary to motion even after multiple attempts at acquisition, specifically at the skull base.
A large right temporal lobe intraparenchymal hematoma is not significantly changed in the short interval, currently measuring 7.2 x 3.3 cm compared to 6.9 x 3.3 cm earlier today.
Surrounding mass effect and vasogenic edema persist with early uncal herniation and partial effacement of the right perimesencephalic cistern again observed.
3-mm of leftward septum pellucidum shift is unchanged.
Foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage in several right temporal lobe sulci as well as the right central sulcus is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No significant change in size of a large right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema and mass effect.
Smaller foci of right-sided subarachnoid hemorrhage are also unchanged.

Interval decrease in size of large right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with edema and mass effect.
Scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage bilaterally.
Interval increase in caliber of the lateral and third ventricles, suggestive of early hydrocephalus.

FINDINGS: There is a large right temporal lobe intraparenchymal hematoma, which is smaller in size, measuring 65 mm x 30 mm (previously 72 mm x 33 mm), with associated surrounding edema.
There are scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage, with hemorrhage filling the cortical sulci bilaterally.
There is minimal persistent right uncal herniation.
No new foci of hemorrhage is identified.
No intraventricular hemorrhage is identified.
There is, however, interval dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles, suggestive of early hydrocephalus.

There is a high-density material seen in the expected region of the stomach as well, which may represent contrast material instilled via the Dobbhoff tube.

Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 106 0 92 356/436 0 12 42   ([**-8/2714**])   Brief Hospital Course: This patient was admitted to the ICU for observation with concern that he would deteriorate and possibly need either surgical evacuation or a ventirculostomy.
A neurology Consult was obtained for prognosis and assesment.
Neurology felt that this bleed was likely due to Amyloid angiopathy and recommended weaning of the Keppra and restarting Asprin as soon as possible.
Patient's exam continues to wax and wane, and his swallowing ability has worsened.
Repeat evlauation by Speech Therapy revealed that the patient is at high risk for aspiration.
We asked Neurology to speak to the family about prognosis and risks for subsequent strokes with the diagnosis of Amyloid angiopathy.
On [**4-9**] he became tachycardic and was transferred to sicu for diltiazem drip.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
