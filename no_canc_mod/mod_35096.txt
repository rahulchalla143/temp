and was not found for several days.
She was evaluated at an OSH and, after being stabilized, was thought to have some new LE weakness, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] neurology for evaluation.
The initial assessment of her neurolocigal status by the floor team was clouded by her lethargy, suspected to be likely secondary to the zyprexa she had received overnight.
Nonetheless, in light of her trauma, she received an MRI/MRA of her brain, which was read as showing extensive chronic small vessel ischemic disease, a chronic lacunar infarction in the right thalamus without acute infarction, and apparent occlusion versus slow flow of the left posterior cerebral artery.
She received an EEG which was read as an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow background  with occasional generalized slow activity.
This finding suggests a widespread mild encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing and no clear epileptiform features.
Ultimately, her mental status improved as the day passed, and consequently it was presumed that her lethargy was indeed secondary to the zyprexa.
The remainder of her neurological exam was significant for a LE paraparesis, but thought to be secondary to predominantly to pain and perhaps old spondylosis.
At the OSH, imaging had suggested a T11 vertebral fx with some sort of poorly visualized anterior mass, thought to be a hematoma.
She received an MRI of her C- and T-spine here which showed acute fracture of the anterior portion of the T11 vertebral body which was presumably an unstable fracture with recommended spinal surgical evaluation, and no evidence for cord compression or cord encroachment.
Subsequent CT of the C- and T-spince confirmed unstable distraction fracture of the T11 vertebral body along with disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament, diffuse osteopenia with scoliosis, and diffuse multilevel degenerative joint disease.
On the morning of [**8-25**] she was found to be in a grumpy mood with many complaints about her environs, which, according to family members is consistent with her baseline.
She also had some mild weakness in her deltoids bilaterally R>L.
