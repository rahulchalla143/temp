Asymmetric pulmonary opacities, right greater than left, likely asymmetric pulmonary edema.
A superimposed aspiration/ infection is not excluded in the right base.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: VERY Suboptimal image quality.
Cannot assess diastolic function or pulmonary artery pressures.
Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by mild interstitial edema and a small right pleural effusion tracking into the minor fissure.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 49 yo F with a presumed history of asthma, morbid obesity who presents with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
Cultures were sent and there was no growth.
TTE was a poor quality study.
MICU course was complicated by agitation, requiring propofol.
She was started on Seroquel for agitation in addition to home Zoloft.
MICU course was also complicated by acute renal failure of pre-renal etiology likely [**1-19**] to aggressive diuresis.
# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear etiology.
Differential includes severe asthma exacerbation given history of asthma.
Likely also CAP on top of exacerbation.
Respiratory viral screen sent, and showed no viral infection, MI unlikely, and CE's negative.
Thought that diastolic heart failure could be contributing, and she was placed on lasix gtt for diuresis.
She was started on a lasix gtt with metolazone; however, she developed acute renal failure and her creatinine increased to 1.9.
Diuresis was stopped and patient received IV fluids to treat renal failure, which improved (see below).
Following treatment of pneumonia and diuresis, patient could not be weaned off ETT.
# Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased on [**4-16**].
Thromboembolic Disease:  Concern that patietn may have PE causing hypoxia.
She is too large to have CTA or VQ scan.
# Acute renal failure: Patient received lasix gtt and lasix boluses in addition to metolazone.
Felt to be pre-renal etiology as patient had FE urea calculated at 5.
# VRE UTI:  Patient with VRE UTI during hospitalization.
Repeat urine culture showed no growth.
# DM 2: Placed on home regimen of Lantus and ISS with qid fingersticks.
During admisssion patient had very elevated fingersticks into 400s despite aggressive home lantus dose and sliding scale.
She continued to have agitation and required propofol for sedation as she was agitated with Fentanyl/Versed.
TG's were checked and were elevated so propofol was stopped.
Psychiatry ultimately consulted and recommended stopping psychiatric medications while taking linezolid because of increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
Please use haldol PRN for agitation.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 671**] [**Hospital 4094**] Hospital - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Hypoxic Respiratory failure, community acquired pneumonia, asthma, acute renal failure, acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation SECONDARY: Obesity, hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory failure and you required a breathing tube to breathe.
We could not remove the breathing tube and we had a tracheostomy palced as it will take time for your breathing to become strong without the breathing machine.
We also treated you for a urinary tract infection.
