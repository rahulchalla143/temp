The patient was found to be in acute renal failure with an a BUN of 274 and a creatinine of 11.5.
The renal team decided against hemodialysis to lower his BUN in fear of cerebral edema caused by rapid removal of the BUN osmole.
Bilateral Ureter Obstructions ??????
After performing a pelvic ultrasound, the patient was found to have bilateral calculi at both ureterovesicular junctions.
However, due to the severe tortuosity of the left ureter, the calculus was removed but the stent could not be placed.
Bilateral renal pelvis urinary cultures were taken.
Prostate Hypertrophy ??????
