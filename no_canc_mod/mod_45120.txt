HOSPITAL COURSE [**2184-9-25**] through [**2184-9-28**]:  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2184-9-25**] and stayed overnight with a low grade fever to 100.8??????
and tachycardia, but no change in white blood cell count.
Chest x-ray was done at that time which showed increased left lower lobe consolidation which was consistent with pneumonia and worsened from prior chest x-ray.
Therefore, the patient's antibiotic course was changed to cover for pneumonia (hospital acquired versus aspiration) instead of previous treatment for tracheobronchitis.
It was pathogen directed against Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus and Pseudomonas, all of which showed moderate growth on sputum culture from [**2184-9-21**].
On further testing, it was identified as not being Enterococcus and therefore assumed to be skin flora and susceptible to current antibiotic regimen.
No source of active bleeding was identified and his hematocrit was stable for the five days prior to discharge.
Due to worsening edema in his right arm just prior to transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, a Doppler study was performed on the right upper extremity which was negative for deep venous thrombosis.
