Admission Date:  [**2117-10-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2117-10-14**]   Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 81-year-old male nursing home resident with past medical history significant for dementia, CVA, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, who is admitted with lethargy and cough.
With this admission, his sputum cultures grew out MRSA and multiple gram-negative rods and he was treated with Vancomycin for seven days, last dose on [**2117-9-27**].
He also was treated for Clostridium difficile colitis and was started on a 17 day course of Flagyl with last dose on [**10-6**].
intake, and a nonproductive cough for the day prior to admission.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG.
History of left parietal CVA.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post TURP.
History of MRSA colonization.
History of aspiration pneumonia.
Recent Clostridium difficile colitis.
History of cerebellar pontine meningioma.
Atherosclerotic disease.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Cervical spondylitis.
General: Elderly, demented man lying in bed in no acute distress with contractures.
Neurologic:  Nonresponsive, does not follow commands or answer questions.
EKG:  Sinus tachycardia with a rate of 118, wandering baseline ST depression in leads V2 and V3, 0.5-1 mm.
Chest x-ray:  Left lower lobe infiltrates.
Sepsis:  Patient admitted with fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis and lactic acidosis suggestive of sepsis.
Given his laboratory and radiological findings, he is thought to have a likely aspiration pneumonia and along with a concurrent UTI.
Patient was treated for sepsis per protocol.
The etiology of his sepsis was thought to be due to aspiration pneumonia with concurrent UTI.
His stool also grew out Clostridium difficile colitis, which also contributed to his septic picture.
Patient's sputum did not grow out a contributing organism.
He did have sparse MRSA in his sputum, which was thought to be a contamination as patient is colonized with MRSA.
Aspiration pneumonia:  Patient with recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
They were cautioned that he is at risk for recurrent aspiration pneumoniae, however, they still declined any sort of invasive feeding measures.
He did occasionally have mucus plugs with very brief desaturation down to approximately 90% which cleared with coughing.
The nursing home will be instructed that should he desaturate, this typically clears with coughing and this is not worrisome as long as his saturations normalize with a cough and clearing of the mucus.
Clostridium difficile colitis:  Patient's stool from [**10-8**] grew out Clostridium difficile.
His symptoms of diarrhea quickly resolved with treatment.
Coronary artery disease:  Patient with history of coronary artery disease status post CABG.
Upon admission, he was tachycardic with slight ST depression in leads V2 and V3.
This was thought to be a strain pattern due to his tachycardia and septic picture.
Patient was also ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
He was thought to be at risk of aspiration as per above, however, his family did not desire any invasive measures, so p.o.
was continued despite his risk for recurrent aspiration.
Prophylaxis:  Patient was placed on aspiration and fall precautions.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Clostridium difficile colitis.
Urinary tract infection.
Coronary artery disease/rule out myocardial infarction.
