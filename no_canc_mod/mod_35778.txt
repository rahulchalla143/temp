1)Hypotension: Initial impression was that pt had urosepsis and was intravascularly deplete (though total body overloaded).
Attempts were then made to diurese the patient which resulted in hypotension that necessitated a brief stay in the MICU.
Adrenal insufficiency was considered, but the patient's am cortisol was 18, inconsistent with this diagnosis.
Thereafter, the patient had stable blood pressures, however he has required fluid bolusing to maintain urine output due to periods of decreased PO intake and overdiuresis.
2)Hypoxia:Pt cxr on admission consistent with pulmonary edema, as well as L sided pleural effusion.
In the setting of urosepsis, the edema was likely due to capillary leak, rather than diminished cardiac output.
The patient continued to require oxygen through out his stay, and had at times a recurrent L pleural effusion (see below).
3)Atrial Fibrillation:Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] had episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation while hospitalized.
4)CHF: The pateint presented with signs of volume overload.
As discussed above, this was most likely due to capillary leak in the setting of sepsis than frank CHF.
After fluid rescusitation, however the patient had persistent vascular congestion and a recurrent L pleural effusion.
Brisk diuresis was avoided due to fear of volume contraction resulting in metabolic alkalosis, as earlier in the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course he became somnolent with an elevated pCO2 in response to brisk diuresis.
At present, pt lasix is on hold due to his low PO intake and the feeling that he is intravascularly depleted.
5)L pleural effusion:this was noted on admission CXR.
Consideration was given to thoracentesis as this effusion was not noted on previous CXR, however the attending felt that this was most likely due to CHF.
OVer the next two days, however, the patient's CXR appeared to have a L sided effusion, thus a chest CT was obtained on [**5-5**] which confirmed the presence of a large L sided loculated pleural effusion.
One pocket of this effusion was tapped on [**2135-5-7**], 500cc of transudative fluid was removed.
The pulmonary service saw this patient and felt that the etiology of the effusion was most likely post-operative, and that given his lack of temp or of elevated WBC count, he did not require definative drainage of the loculations via VATS.
6)Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] has many years of untreated sleep apnea which (combined with his scoliosis)has led to chronic CO2 retention.
In the setting of aggressive diuresis, Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] developed volume contraction and a metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonate around 40) which caused him to be acutely somnolent with a pCO2 near 80.
This resolved with hydration and resolution of volume contraction.
Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] continues to display daytime fatigue and frequently falls asleep--this is likely due to his untreated sleep apnea.
Treatment of his Sleep apnea would no doubt greatly improve his heart failure as well.
The urology service was consulted and noted that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] had performed urodyamics in the office and that the only options for the patient at present were intermittent clean cathing or indwelling foley.
Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] [**Last Name (Titles) 104978**] his foley while walking and had resulting hematuria with clots.
He did have an episode of somnolence due to hypercarbia, probably precipitated by overdiuresis.
In the setting of his C.diff diarrhea, he again began to have problems with lethargy and fatigue, diamox was stopped due this issue.
10)C.Diff:Mr. [**Known lastname 12166**] developed diarrhea on levofloxacin which was positive for C.Diff.
