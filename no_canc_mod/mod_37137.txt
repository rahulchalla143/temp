CXR revealed left pleural effusion but no CHF or PNA.
Due to pulsatile HA there was concern for ICH so a head CT was performed which revealed no ICH.
Due to CP and pulsatile HA with hx of AAA there was concern for aortic and carotid dissection so there was decision for MRA of the chest and head.
She was unable lay flat secondary to pain and orthopnea so she was electively intubated for MRI.
MRA/ MRI revealed no acute infarct or dissection of intracranial or thoracic vessels.
While in the ICU she was treated with levofloxacin for suspected PNA and ruled out for MI with CE x3.
TTE was performed due to concern that effusion was due to CHF which revealed only minimal AS with preserved EF.

A nasogastric tube courses through the stomach with tip below the inferior margin of the radiograph.
Otherwise, there has been no short interval change in appearance of the chest.
Given differences inpatient positioning, a small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Mild cardiomegaly persists.
No acute infarct.
Atherosclerotic disease involving the cavernous ICA bilaterally.
Bilateral parotid masses, incompletely evaluated on the present study.
No evidence of aortic dissection.
Mild atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta with an unfolded aorta.
Right lower lobe dependent atelectasis versus consolidation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2125-1-18**] 1:39 PM IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with small vessel ischemic disease.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct.
Small left pleural effusion with no evidence of acute parenchymal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.
Small hiatal hernia.
ECHO Study Date of [**2125-1-19**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve  leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly  thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2125-1-20**] 9:31 AM IMPRESSION: Worsening left-sided pleural effusion.
Small right-sided pleural effusion.
Bibasilar atelectasis.

# Respiratory Distress: differential includes pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, acute on chronic bronchitis, heart failure exacerbated by renal failure, or some combination of these factors.
Given markedly increased BNP it is likely that the patient has some element of failure.
The patient was treated with Levofloxacin for empiric pneumonia for a total of 7 days.
The patient was also given nebulizers as needed for symptomatic relief.
# Acute on Chronic RF:  Initial FeNA > 1, although patient on Lasix.
Further urine studies suggested that the patient was not pre-renal and her disease is likely a result of progressive atherosclerotic disease.
She had a Renal US which was negative for obstruction.
Anemia appears to be iron deficiency anemia.
Patient was started on iron supplementation, plus some component of anemia of chronic disease, possibly from renal failure.
