Findings of cirrhosis including ascites and splenomegaly.
CT HEAD ([**2127-7-29**]) No acute intracranial hemorrhage or obvious abnormality identified.
However, early cerebral edema may be difficult to identify and needs clinical correlation for exclusion.
If there is a continued clinical concern, imaging followup is recommended to assess for any interval changes.
Cirrhotic-appearing liver with no focal liver lesion identified, and no biliary dilatation.
Dampened hepatic vein waveforms, consistent with cirrhosis.

ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: His neurological exam on admission showed the patient was somnolent, but would awaken to name, unwilling to answer questions but said he was in the hospital, +asterixis.
His altered mental status was thought to be due to hepatic encephalopathy vs. toxic-metabolic in the setting of possibly not tolerating lactulose (given his n/v prior to admission).
CT scan was negative for acute intracranial process.
He was then transferred to the MICU for acute change in mental status with decreased responsiveness to sternal rub.
Non contrast Head CT and CXR were negative for acute process.
EEG showed no seizure.
The acute change in mental status was likely secondary to either changes in portal vein flow or decreased clearance of reglan [**2-3**] renal failure.
ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Patient's Cr was 2.6 on admission from a recent baseline of 1.0-1.5.
Urine lytes were consistent with prerenal vs. hepatorenal etiology.
ABDOMINAL PAIN: Pain was consistent with "bloating" sensation and [**2-3**] discomfort associated with nausea.
This improved his pain and emesis.
Paracentesis was negative for SBP and ultrasound showed slowed portal vein flow, consistent with past ultrasounds.
Abdominal pain subsided with alterations in tube feeds.
4.ETOH cirrhosis-Patient has history of withdrawal seizures, though he states that his last drink was in [**2126-3-2**].
When at goal tube feeds of 45cc/hr, patient complained of bloating and nausea.
