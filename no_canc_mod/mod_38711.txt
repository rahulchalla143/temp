CT abd/pelvis ([**2107-10-16**]): Circumferential mural edema in the distal esophagus suggesting esophagitis, and further evaluation is recommended with endoscopy.
No evidence of pancreatitis.
Hepatic steatosis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
EGD [**10-19**]: Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the duodenal bulb, stomach antrum and lower third of the esophagus.
Impression: Severe esophagitis, Moderate gastritis, Mild Duodenitis.
H Pylori: negative  Brief Hospital Course: 43M w/ EtOH abuse, HTN, remote IVDU, depression, anxiety, and chronic LBP who p/w severe epigastric pain and AG metabolic acidosis found to have ETOH Induced Esphopagitis/Gastritis.
## ETOH Induced Esphopagitis/Gastritis: He was initially suspected of having pancreatitis given the location of his pain and his history of recent binge drinking, but Lipase was 16 and there was no radiographic evidence of pancreatitis on his admission CT abdomen.
Thus, he was thought to perhaps have a functional pancreatitis.
There were no signs of colitis or bowel ischemia on CT.
However, he was noted to have esophageal wall thickening, that refleceted active esophagitis.
GI was consulted to evaluate this, and EGD is planned for [**2107-10-19**], which confirmed severe gastritis, esophagitis and mild duodenitis.
He was discharged with his pain controlled on his home regimen and on [**Hospital1 **] PPi and QID Sucratafate.
- Gastrin level pending at time of discharge - EGD Biopsies pending at time of discharge  ## AG acidosis: The acidosis rapidly improved with IV fluids, although the underlying etiology of hypoperfusion is unclear given that there was no sign of colitis, kidney injury, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism.
The transaminitis suggests liver injury.
Pt was potentially type B lactic acidosis.
## Alcohol withdrawal: Given his binge drinking, he was thought to be at high risk of EtOH withdrawal and was started on a CIWA protocol upon admission to the MICU.
Upon transfer to the floor, he appeared comfortable, and his tachycardia had resolved.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with abdominal pain after drinking significant ammounts of alcohol.
You were found to have severe inflammation in your stomach and esophagus.
