J point elevation with early repolarization in anterior precordial leads is probably a normal variant  CTA: no occlusion noted  CTP: some prolongation of MTT in the watershed distribution  MRI:  watershed strokes between the ACA/MCA and MCA/ACA/PCA on the left hemisphere.
There was also a tiny stroke in the right hemisphere watershed region.
ECHO: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal regional and global systolic function.
No intracardiac source of embolism identified.
No ASD or PFO.
Brief Hospital Course:   Mr. [**Known lastname 48422**] presented to OSH with right hemiplegia and aphasia.
There was no occlusion on CTA, so no further intervention was undertaken.
There was also a tiny stroke in the right hemisphere watershed region.
All vessels were open and there was no hemorrhagic transformation noted.
As he received IV tpa, he was initially admitted to the ICU for monitoring and was transferred out after 24 hours.
He had a TTE, which had no evidence of ASD or PFO; there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal regional and global systolic function.
There was no intracardiac source of embolism identified.
Despite the appearance of the left sided strokes being weaterhsed, it was decided that because he had b/l strokes, the strokes are likely embolic in nature, so Coumadin was started.
For depression during hospitaliztion, he was started on Fluoxetine.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You had sudden onset of right sided weakness and speech difficulties.
The initial brain MRI showed watershed strokes (strokes between major artery territories) on the left hemisphere and a small stroke in the right hemisphere.
However, given that you had strokes on both sides of your brain, a cardiac origin is suspected.
For symptoms of depression, you were started on a medication called Fluoxetine.
