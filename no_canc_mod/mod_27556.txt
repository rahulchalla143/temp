RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2120-12-4**] 9:00 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: reevalaute known head injury  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: s/p fall from stairs REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: reevalaute known head injury CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
Therefore, it is impossible to assess for any interval changes of the following abnormalities:  There is a moderate-sized left parafalcine acute subdural hemorrhage causing minor impression upon the left parasagittal cortex.
There is a smaller acute left frontal temporal subdural hemorrhage, again causing slight impression upon the adjacent cortex.
There is also presumed small quantity of acute subdural hemorrhage seen extending along the leaves of the tentorium on both sides.
There is no definite sign for intraaxial hemorrhage.
There is a question of a tiny amount of hemorrhage sedimenting within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], as seen only on image 18.
There is no hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or visible minor or major vascular territorial infarction.
There are small air-fluid levels seen within both maxillary sinuses with extensive opacification of both ethmoid sinuses by soft tissue material.
There is moderately extensive opacification of the sphenoid sinus.
There is minimal mucosal thickening within the left frontal air cell.
The sinus abnormalities are likely inflammatory in origin.
No other overt osseous pathology is seen.
CONCLUSION: Multicompartmental acute subdural hemorrhages.

There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen.
The intra- abdominal small bowel appears normal.

No free fluid in the pelvis.
No abnormal lymphadenopathy.
No evidence of arterial extravasation in the deep pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: No evidence of spinal or rib fracture.
Specific attention to the ribs adjacent to the spleen demonstrate no evidence of fracture.
Mild degenerative changes and bilateral spondylolysis at the L5 level.
Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the above findings.
IMPRESSION: 1) Moderately sized splenic contusions/lacerations; no subcapsular hematoma and no evidence of vascular injury/arterial extravasation.
2) No evidence of other solid organ injury, fracture, or other traumatic injury throughout the abdomen and pelvis.
3) Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4) Bilateral, exophytic, likely simple renal cysts.
Portable AP chest with underlying trauma board straightens endotracheal tube in good position, with its tip 5 cm above the carina.
There is no pneumothorax.
Subtle opacity in the left lower lobe likely represents atelectasis rather than contusion.
No evidence of rib or clavicular fractures.
Single AP view of the pelvis demonstrates no evidence of fracture or dislocation.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of traumatic injury within the chest and pelvis; underlying trauma board limits sensitivity.

INDICATION: Fell from stairs with severe head trauma one day ago, prior CT demonstrating splenic laceration/contusions.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Again demonstrated are small bilateral pleural effusion/atelectasis, unchanged from the prior study.
There is no evidence of subcapsular hematoma or arterial extravasation to suggest arterial injury.
There is no free air in the abdomen.
Following the lateral cortex of the mid portion of the left kidney, there are two segmental areas of hypoattenuation, which likely represent segmental infarcts.
There is no evidence to suggest small bowel injury or mesenteric hematoma.
No free fluid in the deep pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen.
Again, bone windows demonstrate no evidence of fracture.
No subcapsular hematoma or arterial extravasation.
2) Interval development of two segmental areas of underperfusion in the left kidney, compatible with segmental infarction, not present on the prior CT.
Multiple areas of cortical scarring bilaterally suggestive of chronic infarction.
3) Small bilateral pleural effusion/atelectasis, unchanged from prior study.

HISTORY: Evaluate for interval change of known subdural hematoma.
FINDINGS: Again seen is a moderate-sized left parafalcine subdural hematoma with minimal impression upon the left parasagittal cortex, not significantly changed from the study of one day prior.
The small left frontotemporal subdural hematoma is unchanged in size as well.
There is a large area of low density in the right temporal and parietal lobes with foci of increased density, with these findings suggesting an evolving hemorrhagic contusion.
There is a smaller similar area in the left frontal lobe, again likely a hemorrhagic contusion.
Alternatively, but much less likely, the large area of low density in the right temporal and parietal lobe also raises the possibility of evolving venous infarction.
A small amount of hemorrhage is seen layering in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], seen on series 2, image 14.
There is a small focus of low attenuation seen left of the fourth ventricle on series 2, image 8, not well appreciated on the prior study, but seen on the patient's scanned in study from an outside hospital of [**2120-12-4**].
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
Stable appearance of left parafalcine and left frontotemporal subdural hemorrhages.
