Admission Date:  [**2135-2-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2135-2-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2079-1-30**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26350**] is a 57-year-old male with diabetes mellitus complicated by end-stage renal disease status post transplant, coronary artery disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastroparesis, hypertension, who had actually been recently admitted on [**2135-2-14**] for coffee ground emesis.
He had had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing mild gastritis and esophagitis and then he was discharged on [**2135-2-15**].
On the 26th he took half his normal NPH Insulin and had worsening nausea and vomiting.
He also complained of epigastric pain.
He denied fever, cough, shortness of breath or any localizing symptoms of infection.
He also had an EKG with sinus tachycardia at 102, normal axis, ST depression in the lateral leads which resolved with treating his tachycardia.
He had no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no congestive heart failure.
's and was chest pain free.
He was transferred to the medicine team for further management of his non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by retinopathy and neuropathy.
End-stage renal disease secondary to the diabetes mellitus status post renal transplant in [**2127**] on chronic immunosuppression.
Gastroparesis in the past, but the patient said that it has not been a problem since [**2127**] since he had his renal transplant.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Coronary artery disease.
Recent gastritis/esophagitis likely secondary to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for cancer in his father and arthritis in his mother.
Extraocular movements intact, anicteric, no lesions in the oropharynx, no jugular venous distension.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation except for minor crackles at the bases.
Extremities:  He had [**1-23**] dorsalis pedis pulses, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
The patient had an ECG on the [**2-16**] showing sinus tachycardia at 102, normal axis, ST depressions in 1, 2, V5 to V5.
He had one on the 28th which showed sinus at 70, normal axis, no ST changes, Q's or T wave inversions.
We also repeated the EKG when the patient was experiencing nausea and vomiting to make sure this wasn't an anginal equivalent and the patient similarly had a normal sinus rhythm with normal axis and no EKG changes, peaked Q's or T wave inversions.
Urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase, negative for nitrite, negative for white blood cells and no bacteria.
Heart size was slightly enlarged, no evidence of congestive heart failure, flattening of diaphragms consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, minimal bibasilar atelectasis, no pulmonary consolidation or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:  The patient was a 56-year-old male who presented to the Emergency Department status post nausea and vomiting with diabetic ketoacidosis.
He was treated for the diabetic ketoacidosis in the medical intensive care unit and soon after ruled in with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with peak troponin of 7.
He was chest pain free throughout his whole stay and hemodynamically stable.
It was unclear exactly if the myocardial infarction precipitated the nausea and vomiting and diabetic ketoacidosis or vice-versa.
It seems due to the timing of the troponin leak that it was most likely secondary to the diabetic ketoacidosis.
Coronary artery disease; non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
for increased blood pressure control.
The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] early the following week after the stress test or earlier if there is an abnormal result.
Congestive heart failure:  No evidence on examination throughout his whole stay despite vigorous hydration for diabetic ketoacidosis.
Valve:  No issues.
Rhythm:  The patient was placed in telemetry with no ectopy.
GI:  The patient was without any episodes of coffee ground emesis.
The patient had Reglan added to his regimen for possible gastroparesis that may be resulting in his nausea and vomiting.
The patient had stable GI function since his transplant but EGD was notable for some retention of food and pill material.
Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by neuropathy.
Renal failure status post renal transplant.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to have a stress test on Thursday, [**2-24**]; an ETT MIBI, and this has been scheduled.
