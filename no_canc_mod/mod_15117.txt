Admission Date:  [**2180-12-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-12-13**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This was an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] with about 30 min of mid chest crushing pain radiating to both arms and was found to have ST elevations in the anterior and lateral leads.
The patient was given Nitroglycerin drip, Heparin IV, Aspirin 325, and then transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for emergent cardiac catheterization.
On catheterization, the patient had a mid left anterior descending 99% lesion, and stent was placed, 70% lesion at the origin of OM1 and mid circumflex, diffuse disease proximal and distal to lesion.
There was trace mitral regurgitation, anterolateral hypokinesis, dyskinesis, and bulging of apex.
After successful stent placement, the patient developed nausea, hypertension, and was given a Dopamine drip.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
No increased weights.
No dysuria or frequency.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.
General:  The patient was an elderly female in no apparent distress.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.
No carotid bruits.
No murmurs appreciated.
Extremities:  There was [**2-9**] edema at right mid shin.
Electrocardiogram precatheterization was normal sinus rhythm at 88 beats per minute, LAD normal intervals, Q-waves in II, III, AVF, V1-V5, ST elevations in V2-V5, 2-3 mm.
Postcatheterization electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, LAD normal intervals, Q-waves in II, III, AVF, V1-V5, ST elevations in V2-V5, 0.5-1.0 mm.
INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  This was an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who presented at an outside hospital with acute anterolateral myocardial infarction.
After successful stent placement in the left anterior descending, the patient developed hypotension and nausea.
The patient returned back to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab for IABP placement.
An echocardiogram was done which showed a large pericardial effusion which was tapped, and 350 ml of frank blood was drained from the effusion at which point cardiac index improved.
Repeat echocardiogram showed no recurrence of hemopericardium.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was removed approximately six hours after pericardial drain was removed with no complications.
She had frequent runs of ventricular bigeminy and trigeminy, some runs of NSVT, occasional premature ventricular contractions, but no other remarkable events of ectopy.
Heme:  The patient developed low platelets after intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.
This was a known complication of intra-aortic balloon pump; however, she was also started on Heparin as anticoagulation for IABP placement.
Infectious disease:  The patient did develop a fever spike of 101.2??????
This was thought to be due to thrombophlebitis in the arm where she had an IV.
She was transferred to the floor and had no further complications and was felt to be ready for discharge to home with home health services.
The patient is to have INR checked every 3-5 days and have her Coumadin adjusted accordingly until INR is in therapeutic range of 2.0-3.0.
