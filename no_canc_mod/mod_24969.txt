[**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]   FINDINGS: BACKGROUND: There was technical difficulty with continuous FP1 electrode artifact.
There were frequent fairly widespread, frontally predominant, often synchronous but on occasions more on the right, medium-voltage, brief runs of 1.5-2 Hz sharp and slow wave discharges.
There were also infrequent bifrontal bursts of low amplitude 1 Hz delta which were superimposed with beta activity.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no pushbutton activations.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study due to frequent fairly widespread, frontally predominant runs of sharp and slow wave discharges that are often synchronous but on occasions more on the right.
This finding is indicative of an increased tendency for seizures.
The background in between these epileptiform waves demonstrates mixed alpha and theta activity, indicative of a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction with a nonspecific etiology.
There were no electrographic seizures.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
Severely depressed LVEF.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Eccentric MR jet.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focalities in the inferolateral wall, basal inferior wall.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a global moderate dysfunction with focalities in the lateral and basal inferior walls.
There is solid mild MR across the new ring.

Otherwise, compared with [**9-5**] lung aeration, pulmonary vascular congestion, bilateral pleural effusions and attendant atelectasis have improved.
No focal consolidations are suggestive of pneumonia.
Moderate cardiomegaly stable.
There are no focal consolidations suggestive of pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of bilateral pleural effusion and pulmonary vascular congestion.
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 42222**] DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2618**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2619**] Approved: WED [**2150-9-9**] 8:44 AM     Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with chronic systolic congestive heart failure.
She underwent cardiac catherization which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease, moderate mitral regurgitation with mean wedge pressure of 24 mmHg, moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction with an EF of 40%, and a tightly occluded proximal left subclavian artery.
On [**8-27**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed mitral valve repair and coronary artery bypass grafting.
On postoperative day zero, she was noted to have an episode of left sided myotonic seizure.
Neurology was consulted and head CT scan was obtained, showing no acute intracranial process.
EEG findings were consistent with seizure, revealing frequent epileptiform discharges.
MRI was obtained on postoperative day two which showed no evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage.
Given neurologic status, she had a prolonged period of mechanical ventilation.
Despite antiseizure therapy, she continued to experience extremely frequent seizures/status epilepticus.
Amiodarone was initiated on postoperative day six for episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.
Empiric antibiotics were started on postoperative day seven for concern of RLL consolidation versus pleural effusion.
She remained afebrile with no significant leukocytosis and negative sputum cultures.
Diuretics were adjusted accordingly with improvement of pleural effusions.
Following extubation, she underwent speech and swallow evaluation which showed a functional swallowing mechanism without overt sign/symptoms of aspiration.
Continuous EEG monitoring was eventually discontinued and no further seizure activity was noted.
She remained in a normal sinus rhythm with no further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
At discharge, her pain was well controlled and surgical incisions were healing well.
