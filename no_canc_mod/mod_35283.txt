Admission Date:  [**2121-2-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-2-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-8-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Known firstname 922**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: emergent CABG X 4/IABP on [**2121-2-10**]   History of Present Illness: 67 yo M with 2 week history of chest pain, positive stress test.
On arrival from OSH patient reported ongoing chest pain unreleived with nitroglycerin and morphine during transport.
Myocardial infarction.
Right ventricular function.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %) with basal inferior and basal septal hypokinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
effusion TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest PA and lateral.
Status post sternotomy is noted and the presence of multiple surgical clips in the anterior left side of mediastinum is compatible with preceding bypass surgery.
Thoracic aorta unremarkable and only the most lower portion of the descending aorta is mildly obliterated by a small area of left lower lobe atelectasis.
No acute parenchymal infiltrates are identified, nor is there evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
Very mild blunting of the right-sided lateral pleural sinuses observed and the lateral view confirms this mild blunting to exist on the right side and to a slightly more prominent degree on the left side adjacent to the posterior segment atelectasis.
Bony structures of the thorax grossly within normal limits and there is no evidence of pneumothorax on the frontal view in the apical area.
The pulmonary vasculature has not changed, but comparison confirms that there remain minor pleural densities and a moderately-sized posterior segment atelectasis on the left side.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he continued to have chest pain and stated it had been continuous since catheterization despite the addition of nitroglycerine SL and Morphine IV.
He remained unstable following surgery and was kept sedated, the night of surgery he had a VT arrest and returned to NSR after defibrillation.
TEE the following day showed global LV hypokinesis and RV systolic dysfunction.
Additionally he was seen by vascular for decreased pulses in right foot while the IABP was in place, his exam improved once the IABP was removed.
He had atrial fibrillation for which he was rebolused with amiodarone, and started on lopressor.
He was started on Keflex for a scant amount of serosanguinous sternal drainage.
