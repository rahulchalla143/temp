Admission Date:  [**2127-8-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2127-12-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2127-8-6**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Neonatology  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 38492**] [**Known lastname 51820**] is a 510 gm product of a 28 week gestation born to a 36 year old gravida 5, para 1 woman whose pregnancy was complicated by chronic hypertension and severe intrauterine growth restriction.
Ultrasound showed no structural defects.
Absent end diastolic flow along with a nonreassuring pattern prompted delivery by cesarean section on [**8-6**].
The infant emerged with good tone and poor respiratory effort.
She was intubated in the Delivery Room for continued poor respiratory effort and air movement.
Lungs, coarse crackles bilaterally.
(Although chest x-ray showed endotracheal tube to be slightly high, but then repositioned.)
She had a pulmonary hemorrhage on day of life #2 coinciding with patent ductus arteriosus.
She required reintubation on day of life 12 for increased work of breathing.
She became increasingly labile on the ventilator requiring increased ventilator settings and a brief trial of high-Fi oscillatory ventilation.
Sputum cultures at this time were positive for proteus mirabilis and Stenotrophomonas.
Chest x-ray showed diffuse patchy infiltrates.
She has not had any recent apneic episodes.
Apnea of prematurity was mild in nature.
She did not require fluid boluses or pressors.
An echocardiogram on [**8-9**] showed a patent ductus arteriosus and she received a course of Indomethacin on day of life #3.
Because of her severe chronic lung disease, an echocardiogram was performed on [**11-28**], results showed right ventricular pressures less than half of systemic pressure, trace tricuspid regurgitation, and good biventricular function.
She advanced on enteral feeds to 80 cc/kg but was made NPO on day of life #13 for increased lability on a ventilator, bilious aspirate and abdominal distention.
Reglan and Zantac were started for gastroesophageal reflux on day of life #88.
There has been no history of significant feeding intolerance.
She did have loose stools intermittently thought to be related to hyperosmolar feeds.
Infectious disease - A complete blood count with differential and a blood culture were drawn upon admission to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit.
She was treated for seven days with Ampicillin and Gentamicin for presumed sepsis (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and severity of illness).
[**Known lastname 38492**] was started on Vancomycin and Gentamicin on day of life #13 for increased lability.
Blood culture at that time was negative but trach aspirate was positive for Proteus mirabilis and Stenotrophomonas.
She has intermittently received Nystatin cream for a monilial diaper rash.
A [**Hospital6 256**] social worker has been involved with the family.
CARE/RECOMMENDATIONS: Feeds at discharge - Ad lib demand feeds of 30 cal breast milk or NeoSure.
State newborn screening - The last newborn screen was sent on [**10-16**], no abnormal results have been reported.
Born between 32 and 35 weeks with two of the three of the following; Daycare during respiratory syncytial virus season, with a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school-age siblings; or 3.
With chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Chronic lung disease 4.
Hyperbilirubinemia 5.
Sepsis/pneumonia 6.
Apnea of prematurity 7.
Patent ductus arteriosus, status post Endocet                                [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 35940**], M.D.
