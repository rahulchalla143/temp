History of Present Illness: 49 M c/ PMH HCV and alcoholic cirrhosis, presented on [**3-10**] for biopsy and fiducial placement into liver by interventional radiology for 2 liver nodules that are being followed.
The patient has had shortness of [**Last Name (un) 6250**] and some evolving chest pain in the setting of dizziness.
The patient was given 2 units of blood and imaging at an outside hospital revealed a large hemothorax in the R lung.
He now complains of dull lower R lateral chest pain.
No sharp pain, no radiation.
No alleviating or exacerbating symptoms other than cough and pressure feom the outside.
Notably patient had a fall several weeks ago where he reports he was found at an outside hospital to have a lung contusion and possible history of broken ribs.
Pt has a long history of alcoholism and had his last drink 3 days ago prior to presenting to the hospital for his biopsy.
He spiked temperatures as high as 103.3- these were attributed to administration of blood products and cultures and antibiotics were not sent.
Seizures were felt to be secondary to delirium tremens.
Patient continued to spike, suffered from decreased urine output.
On evaluation, patient was intubated, sedated, unresponsive and actively seizing.
Review of systems: Unable to obtain ROS given patient's mental status.

MODERATE GROWTH.
MODERATE GROWTH.
[**2139-3-15**] 3:33 pm PERITONEAL FLUID                              **FINAL REPORT [**2139-3-21**]**     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2139-3-15**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2139-3-18**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2139-3-21**]):    NO GROWTH.
Trichrome stain evaluated and also shows focal sinusoidal fibrosis.
Moderate predominantly macrovesicular steatosis.
Rare cells with balloon degeneration are seen.
Mild chronic inflammation of portal areas/fibrous tracts with bile ductular proliferation.
No carcinoma seen.
Note:  The findings are consistent with cirrhosis with focal features consistent with a component of metabolic injury.
The patient also has a clinical history of hepatitis C. .
CYTOLOGY [**2139-3-15**] Peritoneal Fluid:  	NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
IMAGING [**2139-3-11**] CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: CT CHEST: There is a large right hemothorax with collapse of the right lowerand middle lobes.
Layering hyperdense blood products is noted posteriorly within this hemothorax.
While there is no evidence of active extravasation on this study, the cause of this bleeding is likely due to bleeding from an intercostal vessel or from the diaphragm as there is a fiducial seed noted immediately adjacent to or through the diaphragm at the dome of the liver.
No definite diaphragmatic defect.
There is no pneumothorax.
The left lung is clear with minimal dependent atelectasis.
CT ABDOMEN: The liver is nodular in contour consistent with known cirrhosis.
Extensive varices including paraesophageal and recannulated umbilical vein and vein of Sappey are present.
Small amount of ascites is again noted surrounding the liver.
There is no evidence of hemoperitoneum.
There is no free air.
CT PELVIS: The appendix is somewhat prominent but is unchanged in appearance over multiple prior studies.
A small amount of fluid is noted within the pelvis, unchanged.There is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: Multiple old rib fractures are noted in the right hemithorax.
No concerning osseous lesions are identified.
Interval development of large right hemothorax with right lower and middle lobe collapse.
While there is no evidence of active extravasation on this study, the source of this bleeding could be from an intercostal vessel or from injury to the diaphragm from the recent procedure.
Cirrhotic liver with multiple varices, as seen and characterized on multiple prior studies.
Small amount of abdominal ascites, unchanged in volume with no evidence of hemoperitoneum.
[**2139-3-11**] 	CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Interval insertion of right-sided chest tube with re-expansion of the right mid and lower lobe and evacuation of large right hemothorax.
Minimal right lower lung atelectasis persists.
One showed shaking activity that appeared to be shivering or a behavioral change and not epileptic, and the EEG at the time showed just the movement artifact with the same frequency as the movements.
There was plentiful movement and muscle artifact throughout the rest of the recording, but the background showed a low voltage record, often with some generalized slowing.
This suggested a widespread encephalopathy, and the faster activity raised the possibility that some of this was due to medications.
There were no clear seizures.
There is a right lower lobe infiltrate that is increased in the interval.
There is also increased opacity in the left lower lung which is predominantly due to volume loss but underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
There is pulmonary vascular redistribution.
There is a small right effusion.
[**2139-3-16**] Abdomen (Supine Only) here is a nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of overt obstruction or pneumatosis.
IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of obstruction.
[**2139-3-18**] RUQ U/S: The liver is nodular in contour and heterogeneous in echotexture, in keeping with known history of cirrhosis.
A cyst with peripheral calcification measuring 1.5 cm is seen anteriorly in the left lobe, unchanged from prior study.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
The gallbladder is thick-walled and edematous, though given the lack of gallbladder distention, this likely reflects third spacing and underlyingliver disease.
Moderate ascites and right pleural fluid is noted.
No evidence of acalculous cholecystitis.
In the setting of a non-distended gallbladder, gallbladder wall thickening likely reflects third spacing and underlying liver disease 2.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 49 yo M with Hep C and EtOH Cirrhosis who presented after liver biopsy with hemothorax now who was transferred to the hepatorenal service following a prolonged MICU course complicated by delirium tremens and pneumonia.
His antibiotics were stopped in sequence as he remained breathing well on room air, afebrile, and with a decreasing white count.
Delirium Tremens / Hepatic Encepholopathy / ICU Delirium: The patient was disoriented upon transfer to the hepatorenal service, but showed no evidence of agitation.
He was treated with lactulose and rifaximin and quickly returned to his baseline mental status.
At the time of discharge he was not confused or encephalopathic.
Acute Renal Failure - The patient's creatinine increased to 1.3 from baseline of 0.6, likely due to pre-renal causes.
Diuretics were held in the setting of acute renal failure (see above).
Liver Lesions: The IR guided biopsy showed no evidence of malignancy.
Hyperglycemia: The patient developed hyperglycemia while on TPN.
He was started on an insulin sliding scale which was discontinued once he was off TPN and tolerating po's without evidence of hyperglycemia.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Hemothorax Ventilator associated pneumonia Delirium secondarily to hepatic encephalopathy and ICU stay Delirium tremens and alcohol withdrawal with possible seizures   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 78893**]  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for a blood in your thorax, alcohol withdrawl, penumonia and and changes in your ability to think.
