The pregnancy was complicated by severe preeclampsia, oligohydramnios, and fetal growth restriction.
Mother was admitted on [**10-17**] for monitoring, and was given betamethasone [**Date range (1) 26989**].
At delivery, infant required PPV and subsequently intubation for poor respiratory effort.
Infant was active and responsive.
Cardiac was regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.
He had moderate apnea of prematurity and was treated with caffeine for 21 days.
Apnea of prematurity and feeding coordination gradually improved, and last spell at rest was on [**12-20**] and last spell with feeding was on [**12-21**].
Cardiovascular: Infant remained hemodynamically stable throughout admission without evidence of cardiovascular compromise.
A murmur was noted to develop, eventually prompting echocardiogram on [**11-19**] which revealed several small muscular VSDs.
Caloric density was subsequently increased to maximum intake of BM 30 kcals/oz.
Earlier in hospitalization, mild hyponatremia was noted as enteral feedings were advanced, treated with NaCL supplements.
Hyponatremia resolved, and the NaCl supplements were discontinued on [**12-7**], with Na level remaining stable at 135-136 since then; last level was 136 on [**12-20**].
Infant has a moderate-sized right inguinal hernia which has remained soft and reducible, as well as a small umbilical hernia.
Hematology:  Infant developed hyperbilirubinemia requiring treatement with phototherapy for four days, with maximum bilirubin level of 3.8.
Infant did develop anemia of prematurity, and received one PRBC transfusion on day of life 19.
Blood cx was negative, but initial CBC showed significant leukopenia, which resolved on repeat CBC day [**2-2**].
Of note, antibiotics were changed from day 5 to 7 to oxacillin and gentamicin for mild umbilical erythyema, which subsequently resolved.
On [**12-20**], shortly after receiving 2 month immunizations, infant developed temp instability as well as increased spells.
Eyes were examined periodically per protocol, with no retinopathy detected.
Chronic lung disease.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the     child's life, immunization against influenza is     recommended for household contacts and out of home     caregivers.
