Admission Date:  [**2145-12-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-12-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-11-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**] Chief Complaint: Fevers  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy lumbar Puncture  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 3060**] is a 55 year old male with hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD s/p orthotopic liver transplant in [**6-/2137**], and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture and subsequent tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in [**8-/2145**] who was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital from [**Hospital1 15454**] Rehabilitation Facility on [**2145-11-21**] for evaluation of fevers.
Per notes, he spiked a fever to 104.5 degrees on the day of presentation and was initially tachycardic and hypotensive and was initially started on doripenem.
Upon arrival to the emergency room at OSH, he was no longer hypotensive but was persistently tachycardic.
While in the ICU it appears that he had a broad infectious workup.
Sinus cultures from [**2145-11-21**] and endotracheal washings from [**11-24**] grew acinetobacter sensitive to tobramycin, amkacin and bactrim and he was started on amikacin from [**2145-11-21**] and received this until [**2145-11-30**].
G-tube cultures [**2145-11-25**] with enterobacter, enterococcus and mixed gram negative rods.
He had a non-contrast head CT which showed sinus disease but was otherwise negative.
CT of the abdomen without contrast did not show evidence of abscess.
CT chest showed a possible hazy right sided infiltrate.
Gallium scan showed uptake in areas of known fractures and in the tracheostomy and PEG tube sites.
All antibiotics it appears were discontinued on [**11-30**] after no fever source was identified but he continued to spike fevers and was started on vancomycin and cefepime on [**12-1**].
History of DTs in the past Type II Diabetes Pancytopenia following liver transplant thought to be secondary to immunosuppressive medications Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Motor Vehicle Accident with multiple injuries [**8-13**] (C6-C7 facet fractures s/p corpectomy, C7-T1 anterior cervical fusion and C5-T2 posterior cervical depression fusion, left mandibular fracture, left wrist fracture s/p ORIF, multiple rib fractures, right clavicular fracture, mediastinal hematoma, small pericardial effusion, asysolic arrest for 5 minutes)   Social History: Currently living at [**Hospital1 **] LTAC.
Physical Exam: Vitals: Tm 100.4 97  120/90-->90/60s  120  100% on 35%FM Pain: unknown-nonverbal, no grimacing Access: RUE PICC [**12-3**] Gen: chronically ill, diaphoretic HEENT: trach site clean CV: tachy, regular, no m Resp: scattered rhonchi, mostly clear, poor effort Abd; soft, no grimacing, PEG tube, +BS, foley yellow urine Ext; no edema Neuro: baseline nonverbal, blinks to command, contractures UE/LE Skin: b/l lateral feet with deep erythematous area  with darkened center(blood blister vs deep tissue injury), no skin breakdown  Pertinent Results: Other labs/interpretation: no leukocytosis Hgb stable [**8-14**] Chem panel remarkable for rising BUN 38 today, creat 1.0 Tobra 14.6 [**12-15**] .
Imaging/results: EEG [**12-16**] prelim: diffuse encephelopathy, no seizures .
Some prominence of ill-defined pulmonary vessels persists,suggesting continued pulmonary vascular congestion.
Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm could reflect atelectasis and small pleural effusion.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
Right upper lobe collapse due to obstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus with secretions; nonobstructive left lower lobe collapse.
Bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions, more marked on the right with dependent right lung base atelectasis.
Small pericardial effusion.
Multiple old fractures and fixation hardware in the ervicothoracic spine from previous trauma.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2145-12-1**] 7:19 PM IMPRESSION: Perihilar opacities, raising question of early CHF.
Multiple rib fractures and right clavicle fracture.
No pneumothorax detected.
Patchy opacity at the left base, question atelectasis versus early infiltrate.
FOOT 2 VIEWS RIGHT PORT Study Date of [**2145-12-1**] 11:28 PM IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited exam, but no findings to confirm the presence of osteomyelitis .
No acute pathology is identified in the abdomen and pelvis to explain the patient's symptoms.
Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
Unchanged calcified hepatic lesion in the interlobar fissure.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2145-12-3**] at 11:27:07 AM      FINAL Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetations found.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2137-5-21**], there is no significant change   Brief Hospital Course: 55 year old male with DM, ETOH abuse/cirrhosis s/p OLT [**6-/2137**] c/b chronic rejection, ETOH related MVA [**8-13**], complicated course, now anoxic brain injury s/p trach/PEG admitted from extended care facility->OSH [**11-21**]-->[**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**11-30**] for persistant fevers, presumed pulm source, stable on Abx, now on Gen Med [**12-14**] awaiting placement.
Imaging so far has been unrevealing and has included abdominal CT without contrast, head CT (sinus disease) and chest CT. TTE negative for gross endocarditis.
Afebrile for >48hours, only low grade temps likely [**2-6**] atelectasis from thick mucous.
Per neuro, severe baseline anoxic injury with toxic/metabolic encephalopathy.
multiple RF for seizures (tacrolimus, carbepenem abx, baseline anoxic injury) but none clinically obvious and EEG on [**12-16**] c/w encephlopathy (prelim), no seizures.
-encephalopathy is likely from diffuse axonal damage (anoxic injury) but worse with acute infection, multiple meds, etc.
some degree volume depletion (insensible losses with sweats) since BP also low when tachy worse.
Also worse when low grade fevers.
Cant give continuous IVF [**2-6**] pulm edema on CXR.
Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: Patient required vent support for few days in setting of likely pneumonia/tracheobronchitis and possible volume overload.
- wean O2 as tolerated, agressive pulm toilet, frequent suctioning, cont mucomyst nebs - treat infection as above -CXR suggesing pulm edema but intravascularly depleted (hypotension/tachy/elevated BUN) so cannot do now .
Acute Renal Failure - Resolved, likely secondary to sepsis on initial presentation - monitor, BUN has been going up, gets IVFs boluses prn, 1L today.
Monitor closely for volume depletion.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Fevers tracheobronchitis vs HCAP/VAP Acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: STABLE   Discharge Instructions: Admitted with fevers, likely tracheobronchitis vs PNA, on antibiotics (tobramycin/ertapenum) until [**12-22**]   Followup Instructions: please f/u PCP Dr, [**Name9 (PRE) **] in 2weeks.
