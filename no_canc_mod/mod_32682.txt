Focal hypodensities are noted in the pons and in the white matter of the frontal lobe, reflecting old lacunar infarcts.
There is a region of focal narrowing in the left internal carotid artery just before it enters the carotid canal.
There is no evidence of aneurysm formation.
Acute left thalamic hemorrhage exerting moderate mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
Old lacunar infarcts in the pons and frontal lobe white matter suggest hypertension as an etiology.
Focal narrowing of left internal carotid artery just before it enters the carotid canal with no evidence of acute dissection, but features suggesting a prior dissection.
No aneurysm, acute thrombus or acute dissection.
MRI head [**2160-1-7**]: FINDINGS:  Again seen is acute hemorrhage in the left thalamus with surrounding vasogenic edema, resulting in minimal mass effect on the left lateral ventricle with bowing of the septum pellucidum.
No enhancing lesions are visualized, but a repeat study could be considered following resolution of the hematoma.
Extensive white matter disease is largely periventricular.
Also seen are several hyperintense lesions within the pons.
These findings are consistent with microangiopathic changes.
There is small DVA of the right frontal lobe as seen on the CTA.
Mucosal changes are seen in the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.
Acute hemorrhage in the left thalamus resulting in minimal mass effect of the left lateral ventricle.
No enhancing lesions are visualized, but consider repeat study following resolution of hematoma.
Extensive periventricular white matter disease consistent with microangiopathic changes.
CXR [**2160-1-6**]: FINDINGS:  No previous images.
Hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.
Given this, the cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size and there is mild tortuosity of the aorta.
Relative prominence of the central pulmonary vessels with rapid tapering suggests some underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
No evidence of acute pneumonia.
NCHCT [**2160-1-9**]: FINDINGS:  There has been no interval change in the left thalamic intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
No new hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction is seen.
No new hemorrhage.
No change in left thalamic hemorrhage.
Interval development of bilateral maxillary sinus air-fluid level, suggesting the development of sinusitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 77002**] is a 79-year-old man who was admitted with an intraparenchymal left thalamic hemorrhage.
Given the left thalamic hemorrhage, the patient was admitted to the neurologic ICU for further monitoring and management.
He was not initially intubated, but required an IV nipride drip for BP managment.
He had multiple episodes of mucus plugging.
Most of these episodes of hypoxia responded to deep suctioning, but he did have one desaturation on the floor that did not respond initially.
He had two positive C diff tests and was started on Flagyl.
FEN: The patient initially failed a speech and swallow evaluation, and a Dobhoff tube was placed.
GU: He had a urinary tract infection associated with an indwelling Foley catheter and was started on ciprofloxacin.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) INH Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Left thalamic intraparenchymal hemorrhage  Secondary: 1.
COPD 2.
Crohn's disease  Discharge Condition: Good condition, satting in low 90s on room air, tolerating pureed diet, mild residual right-sided weakness ([**4-12**]).
Discharge Instructions: You were evaluated for right-sided weakness and were found to have a bleed in your head.
If you have any further symptoms such as weakness, numbness, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, dizziness, or any other symptom that is concerning to you, please call your PCP or your neurologist or go to the nearest hospital emergency department.
