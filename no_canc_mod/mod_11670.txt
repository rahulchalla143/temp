Admission Date:  [**2139-12-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-12-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2074-12-13**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 36432**] is a 64-year-old morbidly obese male who presented to the [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**11-30**] with acute onset dizziness, diaphoresis while playing cards that night.
He reportedly had increased shortness of breath over the last several weeks, on home O2 with sleep apnea (severe although he reports not using CPAP).
He also complained of nausea and vomiting.
He denied chest pain or chest pressure.
He had one episode similar to this one of dizziness and diaphoresis months ago, but denies any chest pain or pressure.
His mobility at baseline is severely limited by his weight and shortness of breath.
He was felt to be in congestive heart failure by exam and chest x-ray and was given diuretics.
Echocardiogram by report at outside hospital also demonstrated mild aortic stenosis with anteroseptal and inferoseptal hypokinesis that was severe and ejection fraction of 30% to 35%.
Morbid obesity 2.
Questionable history of sleep apnea 3.
Congenitally with one kidney, subsequent chronic renal insufficiency 4.
Depression 5.
Questionable history of diabetes mellitus  ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1.
Mucomyst in anticipation of possible cardiac catheterization  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur at left sternal border.
LUNGS:  Fine crackles at bases bilaterally, no wheezes.
IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 80, PR interval 170, left axis deviation with poor R-wave progression, Qs in V2, V3, no ST-T changes.
Left ventricular hypertrophy was present.
Focal wall motion abnormalities.
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with CKs.
He was diuresed with Lasix and was put on a nitroglycerin drip for preload reduction.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to assess his pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and to guide management of his congestive heart failure.
The patient has not been formally diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and has not had PFTs.
The patient was intubated on [**12-2**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Pulmonary consult was obtained and it was thought the patient's respiratory problems were secondary to pulmonary hypertension due to sleep apnea and/or chronic Ps.
On the afternoon of [**2139-12-6**], the patient had an episode of apnea on pressure support, was subsequently changed to CMV and had an additional episode of hypertension with systolic blood pressures to 60.
Further neurologic exam reveals 5 mm fixed dilated bilaterally and non reactive, no response to sternal rub or noxious stimuli.
A stat head CT was obtained which showed a large cerebellar bleed involving mid brain obscuring the pontine angle.
Upon discussion with the neurology and neurosurgery, it was decided that since there was no sign of brain stem function there would be no benefits to urgent craniotomy and craniectomy, evacuation of hematoma and decompression.
Since there was no sign of brain stem or cerebellar function, this was thought to be consistent with clinical brain death.
Life support was withdrawn on [**2139-12-7**] after neurology's official certification of brain death.
