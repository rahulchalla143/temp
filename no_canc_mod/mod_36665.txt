She recieved blood transfusions and her bleeding stopped, she remained stable and was able to be discharged to home with physical therapy.
ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # [**Name2 (NI) 1793**] Dissection and Incidental Hematomas:  Patient brought to cath lab on [**6-15**] for elective PTA to left [**Month/Year (2) 1793**] for peripheral vascular disease.
Initially tolerated procedure well, but developed left thigh pain prior to transfer from suite and left thigh hematoma was noted.
Patient then became hypotensive and was noted to have evolving hematoma from prior access site in RFA.
CHRONIC PROBLEMS # Peripheral vascular disease (PVD): Severe PVD as noted in HPI.
Prasurgrel was initially held in setting of acute infection with continuation of ASA 325.
She was noted to have dopplerable distal pulses bilaterally.
# Hypertension (HTN): Home regimen includes lisinopril 20 [**Hospital1 **] and HCTZ 25 daily.
These were initially held on admission due to acute hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock.
Lisinopril was then restarted without incident.
# Diabetes mellitus (DM): Continued sliding scale insulin with 34 units lantus while in house.
Peripheral artery disease 2.
After the procedure, you developed some serious bleeding from these arteries requiring you to go back to the catheterization lab and receive several blood transfusions.
