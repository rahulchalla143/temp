Admission Date:  [**2194-3-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2194-4-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Confusion/agitation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 89 M with CAD and pafib presented from home with MS change.
At that time, notes already suggests that he had some confusion.
The family took the patient home five days ago and then brought him to the ED for ongoing and worsening confusion and agitation.
He was obtunded after the study and was tranferred to the MICU because there was difficulty extubating him.
In the MICU, there was a concern for acute stroke since his pupils were noted to be unequal.
The stroke team was called and MRI/MRA was done that did not show acute stroke.
The cause of his mental status change was unclear.
There was a question of seizure in the MICU but EEG was unrevealing.
Currently he is still agitated and the daughter notes a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST [**2194-3-28**] 5:13 AM BRAIN MRI: There is no acute infarct identified.
There is no midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
There are mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease in the periventricular white matter.
No evidence of chronic blood products identified in the brain.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct.
Moderate brain and medial temporal atrophy.
The medial temporal atrophy has progressed since the previous MRI.
The right vertebral artery origin is not well seen due to technical reasons.
On fat-suppressed images, no evidence of fat suppression is seen.
No evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis is seen.
The left posterior cerebral artery is fetal in origin, a normal variation.
Slight narrowing in the distal left vertebral artery on post-contrast images could not be confirmed on 3D images of the head and could be artifactual.
This demonstrated mild to moderately reduced bolus formation and control with premature spillage consistently noted.
Once swallow was initiated, laryngeal elevation, valve closure, and epiglottic deflection were within functional limits.
No episodes of penetration or aspiration were noted.
There is again opacification at the left base consistent with pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis.
The possibility of aspiration pneumonia cannot be excluded without a lateral view.
The right lung is essentially clear with mild atelectatic changes at the bases.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 M, [**Location 7972**] Creole only speaking, admitted for confusion and found to have MRSA UTI and pneumonia.
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU after being intubated and sedated for agitation as in HPI.
Briefly, he was delirious and required intubation for airway protection and to undergo imaging studies and LP safely.
Hospital course outlined by problem below:  # Delirium/agitation: The patient was admitted in a severely confused and agitated state.
EEG was abnormal due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy (likely infection, metabolic, but workup was initially negative).
Repeat UA was positive for MRSA UTI, and CXR showed left sided atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
He was placed on Vanco/Levo for UTI and aspiration pneumonia coverage.
After antibiotics were started, his delirium dramatically improved, but he was still moderately agitated.
He required soft restraints for agitation and protection of the patient himself and for the staff (he was hitting and scratching staff and pulling out foley and IVs).
Making the delirium worse is the fact that he can speak clearly for a few sentences and then will speak nonsensical language and shout in the air.
However, his baseline end stage dementia remained.
A family meeting decided that the patient would become comfort measures only (CMO) (HCP is his son [**Doctor Last Name **], with no gastric tube for feeding, pain control prn, and completion of antibiotic treatment for his infections.
# Nutrition: Patient has minimal oral intake and needs help with eating and drinking.
He occasionally expectorates out his food and drink, and he cannot take PO pills reliably (he expectorates out pills or crushed pills, but will take pills once every day or few days).
Family understands aspiration risk but wants to focus on comfort care at this point.
# Diffuse body pain: No etiology could be found for the patient's diffuse body pain.
He was given morphine 2 IV prn, Tylenol 1 g prn with no change in patient's report of diffuse body pain.
# Inferior myocardial ischemia: The patient had new T wave inversions in leads II, III, aVF on [**2194-3-31**] with 2 sec pauses on telemetry.
He had moderately severe bradycardia and hypotension during this event.
# systolic CHF chronic: has EF 45% on Echo from [**2194**].
Not on ACEI given BP and issue with low oral intake.
# Bilateral eye pain/blindness: The patient was assessed by ophthalmology consult who recommended glaucoma and prophylactic erythromycin eyedrops for the patient.
# Seizure disorder: Continued PO Phenytoin at baseline.
No seizures while in house.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage II, continue care per protocol.
# INR: INR elevated to 1.7, likely secondary to Vit.
K deficiency from antibiotic use.
Ethics consult recommended that the decision for CMO not be changed for the patient and for the patient to be maintained in comfort inhouse, with encouragement of PO intake but no artificial means of nutrition.
