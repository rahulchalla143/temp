Ms. [**Known lastname 26172**] is a 63 yo female with no significant past medical history who presents following acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath at 1 a.m. following a fight with her sister.
She states that she initially developed chest pressure that did not radiate, followed by shortness of breath.
She became lightheaded and states that she felt as though she was going to pass out.
Per EMS report, she was hypoxic and tachycardic.
She was placed on NIPPV 10/5/100% and immediately had one episode of vomiting, requiring suctioning, but reportedly no aspiration.
With finding of pulmonary edema on CXR and positive troponin (1.10), she received Plavix 600 mg PO and was started on integrillin and heparin drips given concern for cardiac ischemia.
She subsequently became transiently bradycardic with HR 40, BP 50/p and a dopamine drip was started.
In the cath lab, patient was found to have clean coronaries and high biventricular filling pressures; no intervention was performed.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Patient denies any recent tick bites or rashes.
She has had some mild shortness of breath with exertion for the past two weeks.

CXR (my read): diffuse infiltrates bilaterally, consistent with pulmonary edema  Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, TO BE REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS: Ms. [**Known lastname 26172**] is a 63 yo female with no significant past medical history who presents with pulmonary edema in the setting of new-onset cardiomyopathy .
# Pump:  Patient presents with pulmonary edema, found to have a cardiomyopathy with EF 20%, with no evidence of active ischemia.
Development of cardiomyopathy follows acute stressful event in this middle-aged female, supporting possible diagnosis of Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy.
This diagnosis is also supported by characteristic left ventricular apical ballooning.
Other possible etiologies of cardiomyopathy include thyroid dysfunction in this patient with h/o goiter vs. lyme myocarditis given recent travel to [**Hospital3 **].
# CAD/Ischemia:  Patient with no evidence of CAD on cardiac catheterization.
- Replete K>4, Mg>2 - Low sodium diabetic diet .
