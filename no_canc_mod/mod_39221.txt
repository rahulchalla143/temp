Admission Date:  [**2105-11-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-12-7**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Quinine / Sulfonamides  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 317**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension, chest pain, SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac cath  History of Present Illness: 84 yo F with PMHx of ischemic cardiomyopathy, MI and CABG in '[**81**], PTCA [**October 2096**] with stent to SVG/LAD, rpeat stent to SVG/LAD in '[**98**], stent to LMCA-LCX in '[**99**], brachytherapy for LMCA-LCx RCA and PDA in [**December 2100**], LMCA intervention in [**May 2101**].
2nd LCx w/ serial 70% lesions at themid segment.
Pt presented to [**Hospital3 1196**] after having anginal sx, DOE prior to admission, went to scheduled HD and was sent to ED for worsening dyspnea and CP.
Pt also complained of cough over the last few days with sputum.
In OSH ED, she got neb, CXR w/ bilateral patchy infiltrates/?
Pt given morphine for CP/SOB and BP dropped to 74/42->66/39.
Pt in CHF with elevated JVP, BNP of 2168.
Heparin not started for guiac positive.
[**11-30**], Started dialysis at 11am but was dropping blood pressure/ no fluid removed.
Pt then developed chest pressure.
At 1:30pm, pt having CP, tachycardic in 120-130's, and was more tachypneic, BP 55/39.
In [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab:  Pt found to have LAD occluded proximally, LCX with 90% leision in the mid-distal segment, RCA without lesions, SVG-LAD patent with previous proximal stent [**90**]% lesion.
CAD - s/p CABG '[**81**], multiple stents 2.
HTN 5.
HTN 7.
hip fracture [**10-28**], now with artificial hip   Social History: Pt is a nonsmoker, does not use alcohol, retired and lives with her husband.
Family History: significant CAD in family  Physical Exam: VS: T 97.6 BP 120/50 HR 76-52 Wt.
+R IJ COR: RRR, S1, S2, III/VI high pitched vibratory systolic murmur heard along left sternal border.
Also holosystolic murmur at apex.
+cracklesat bilateral bases.
No posturing, no facial asymmetry.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent, flow-limiting disease.
The LCx had serial 90% lesions in the mid to distal segment.
The RCA was without flow-limiting disease.
The SVG-LAD had a proximal 90% in-stent restenosis and diffuse noncritical distal disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated filling pressures with mean PCWP 20 mmHg.
Left ventriculography was not performed due to emergent nature of the procedure and to minimize contrast administration in patient with known renal failure.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with some preservation of basal lateral and basal inferior wall motion.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2105-9-30**], left ventricular systolic function has deteriorated, and the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
DDx: 1)HD related hypotension which caused chest pain secondary to decreased coronary perfusion 2)Cardiogenic shock after NSTEMI but CI 2.5 so unlikely.
3)Sepsis from pneumonia causing hypotension then angina from decreased coronary persusion.
Pt reports SOB/Cough that came before chest pain which may suggest pneumonia/sepsis -> hypotension ->angina.
2)CAD: Pt presented with NSTEMI with positive enzymes.
Worsened EF most likely secondary to ischemia from the LCx and SVG-LAD territory prior to intervention.
4)Rhythm: Pt has LBBB with underlying sinus.
5)Renal: Pt has chronic renal failure and HD dependent.
Pt also had pneumonia on CXR and productive cough on admission.
Her symptoms improved after treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
7)ID: Pt was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible PNA seen on CXR at OSH and WBC of 19.
Pt showed clinical improvement with lowering WBC and afebrile with these antibiotic regimen.
No evidence of acute Hct drop during this admission.
Exam noted for 6-7 cm scalp hematoma on the vertex.
Pt denied headache, visual changes, or changes in mental status.
However, if she were to develop worsening headache, changes in mental status, or focal neuro findings, pt should get a STAT head CT to rule out subdural/epidural hematoma.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] TCU  Discharge Diagnosis: CAD Pneumonia Hypotension Chronic renal failure   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, patient breathing on room air.
Pt needs to seek medical attention if she were to develop chest pain, SOB, dizziness, palpitation, diaphoresis, or any other concerning symptoms.
