HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 66-year-old male, with past medical history as below, who was transferred from an outside hospital status post left hemispheric stroke with dense right hemiplegia and aphasia for possible craniectomy for cerebral edema.
On [**2133-6-10**], the patient had been admitted to an outside hospital with right arm weakness and numbness, and was found to have a left parietal stroke.
Within that work-up, he was found to have a left internal carotid artery stenosis of 65 percent, and thus was taken for left carotid endarterectomy on [**2133-6-18**].
Following procedure, the patient went to the PACU and was noted to have a right hemiparesis and was unable to speak.
Due to edema developing around the infarct, the patient was started on Decadron and mannitol, as well as heparin infusion, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.
Chronic back pain.
PERTINENT PHYSICAL FINDINGS:  Revealed a regular heart rhythm with a II/VI systolic murmur.
His neurologic exam was significant for speech which consisted only of mumbling, occasionally saying the word "yes," but at inappropriate times.
He had a left-sided gaze preference, but was attentive to activity on his right side.
Motor revealed flaccid right upper and lower extremities.
CT HEAD:  Showed extensive brain edema in the left frontal, temporal and parietal regions.
There was no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, or shift of the midline.
This suggested an acute left MCA territory infarction with heretofore no signs of herniation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  NEURO:  The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit where mannitol was continued in hopes of lowering intracranial pressure.
MRI of the brain was done to further evaluate his acute infarction.
This again showed a left middle cerebral artery territorial infarct involving the cortical and subcortical regions with petechial hemorrhages in the left parietal region.
There was then mild mass effect in the left lateral ventricle without midline shift.
There were moderate changes of brain atrophy, as well as small vessel disease.
He had stated very clearly that if he had a reversible condition in which he was unable to return to normal, that he would not want to be kept alive by artificial means, or by "heroic measures."
He showed minimal, if any improvement, from a neurologic standpoint, again uttering only the words "yes" and occasionally "no," sometimes seemingly at appropriate times, but others not.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Left hemispheric cerebrovascular accident with residual right-sided hemiparesis and aphasia.
Tylenol suppositories prn pain or fever.
