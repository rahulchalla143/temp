There are small bilateral posteriorly layering pleural effusions.
There is a moderately large amount of high-attenuation fluid surrounding the upper abdomen, most dense around the liver and right kidney consistent with the patient's known renal laceration.
There is a defect in the postural right lateral abdominal wall, which contains the fat and is likely due to prior surgery.
There is no evidence of collecting system injury to the right kidney.
There is a duplex right collecting system with fusion of the two ureters at approximately mid ureter level.
Patchy areas of high attenuation are seen in the right kidney on non-contrast imaging consistent with residual contrast or embolization material.
On enhanced images, there are two rounded foci of decreased enhancement, which could be due to prior laceration or embolization.
The left kidney enhances homogeneously.
There is a small amount of fluid in the abdomen.
A small amount of fluid is also seen within the paracolic gutter.
The omental fat is slightly higher in attenuation, which raises suspicion for ischemia.
There is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
No enlarged inguinal or pelvic nodes are seen.
TLS - negative  CT C-SPINE - no fractures  U/S Scrotum - 1.
Left testicle is not visualized due to a large amount of echogenic material within the left hemiscrotum most consistent with a fat-containing inguinal hernia   Brief Hospital Course: Upon arrival, the patient was emergently taken to the angiography suite, where he underwent coil embolization of the middle pole branch of the R renal artery.
Due to concern that his agitation might be due to EtOH detoxification, he was placed on CIWA protocol, and seen by the addiction counselor.
The patient voiced his understanding of this, and agreed to remain in the hospital if he was allowed to have a cigarette.
R Renal laceration, s/p angiographic embolization 3.
