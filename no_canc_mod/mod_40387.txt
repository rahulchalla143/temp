Admission Date:  [**2156-2-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2156-2-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-12-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: right sided weakness and aphasia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 50 year-old right-handed man who presented by ambulance to an outside hospital after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia.
[**Name (NI) **] went to sleep normally and then on the morning of [**2156-2-19**] he awoke and had coffee with his wife.
She had noticed that he was soft-spoken, but did not notice any language deficits at that time.
It was around 8:00 am that time she noticed he had developed a right-sided facial droop.
NIHSS at OSH was reported as 20 (right-sided weakness and aphasia) and he was given IV tPA (7.7 mg bolus and then 67.3 mg over 1 hour).
CT scan at the OSH was notable for a hyperdense left MCA.
Past Medical History: none  Social History: works as a marine biologist, lives with his wife, who is a speech therapist, and daughter non-[**Name2 (NI) 1818**] minimal EtOH   Family History: Father - had CAD Mother - hypertension no siblings 1 7 yo daughter - healthy   Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM:  T 98 P 60 BP 135/91 R 17 O2 Sat 100% RA GEN: average weight man in NAD, non verbal HEENT: non-icteric sclera, no evidence of trauma CV: no carotid bruits, RRR, nS1S2, no murmurs Pulm: CTABL Abd: soft, NT, ND Ext: no edema  Neuro MS: alert, but unable to answer questions of orientation.
Unable to follow complex commands and only very simple commands were follwed.
CN: pupils 4mm b/l and reactive to light, Visual field deficit to right visual field, EOMI w/ no nystgamus, reacts to stimuli on both sides of face, R facial droop, hearing intact b/l, palate symmetric, tongue midline Motor: initial - some movement but inability to maintain antigravity in the right arm and leg ([**3-13**]) Left side full strength in upper and lower extremities; flaccid tone on the right, normal tone on left Reflexes: brisk reflexes b/l in upper and lower extremities; toes up on the right and down on left Sensory: reacted to painful stimuli on both sides but less on the right in the arm and leg Coordination: Left side FNF no dysmetria; right side unable to test Gait: unable to test  DISCHARGE EXAM: Global aphasia with improved comprehension, no meaningful verbal output, able to mimick exclaimations.
UMN pattern of weakness 4/5.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Diffuse ST-T wave changes.
Cannot rule out acute pericarditis versus early repolarization changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
No pulmonary hypertension or pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
This finding is most consistent with a small ASD or "stretched" patent foramen ovale.
Long segment non-opacification of the left internal carotid artery, completely occluded from 1 cm beyond the carotid bulb and only reconstituting in the most distal supraclinoid portion from ophthalmic artery.
There is complete occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, and minimal residual luminal enhancement of the A1 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery.
Large left MCA territory ischemia with increased mean transit time and decreased blood flow given large area of also decreased volume, there is high risk for this proceeding to infarction.
There are scattered foci of acute infarction within the left MCA distribution involving the basal ganglia, white matter of the left hemisphere and scattered foci of cortical infarction.
No significant edema, or mass effect is demonstrated.
No evidence of hemorrhage is present.
No discernible change in the occlusion of the left internal carotid artery spanning from approximately 1 cm beyond the carotid bulb to the internal carotid and MCA branches.
There is minimal collateral flow through the hypoplastic left A1 and a small left posterior communicating artery.
No interval hemorrhagic transformation.
Interval increased hypodensity along the left MCA territory, compatible with the expected evolution of acute/subacute infarct.
Persistent mild effacement of adjacent sulci and left lateral ventricle, without gross midline shift.
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT ([**2156-2-23**]) Progressive evolution of left MCA territory infarction with local mass effect on sulci in the left lateral ventricle without midline shift.
No hemorrhagic transformation is noted nor elsewhere is there intracranial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 year-old RH man with no significant PMHX presents from OSH after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia.
On presentation to the ED, exam c/w global aphasia and right hemiplegia.
CT/CTA showed L carotid dissection with resulting occlusive of L ICA and MCA, and infarction within the L MCA territory.
Given his story and presentation, he may have dissected his carotid during shoveling the prior night and then developed extensive thrombosis of the left ICA and left MCA.
Initially he was plegic on the right side with reported gaze deviation and visual field deficits, but this had mostly resolved by the time he reached the neuro interventional angio suite, and he could move his right arm and leg with good resistance at this point.
He was admitted to the neuro ICU for post-tPA monitoring, and had no complications.
He had trace muscle contraction but was not antigravity in either lower or upper extremity, though he did withdraw to pain.
Head CT showed local mass effect from edema in the L MCA territory, which likely caused his clinical decline.
There remained some local mass effect, with no midline shift or herniation, and no hemorrhagic transformation.
Although stroke etiology was clearly L carotid dissection, complete stroke workup was done.
TTE showed small stretched PFO or ASD, most likely not related to his current stroke.
Fasting lipids were relatively well controlled, and he was started on low dose simvastatin for pleomorphic effects in secondary stroke prevention.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: L carotid dissection L MCA stroke   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were found to have a dissection of your carotid artery on the left, causing a left MCA stroke.
