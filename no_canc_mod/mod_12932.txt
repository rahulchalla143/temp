HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old male with history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, who is here electively for therapeutic peritoneal tap.
Patient has been experiencing some abdominal discomfort since his last tap approximately one week ago.
He denies any shortness of breath at the current time.
He has increased discomfort when lying down.
He denies any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
He denies any bleeding from the rectum or in his stool.
He denies any lightheadedness, fever or chills.
He is coming here electively for a tap in the setting of elevated INR and decreased platelets.
Acute renal failure.
Diabetes mellitus.
Hyponatremia secondary to cirrhosis.
Grade II esophageal varices.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with diabetes, but no liver disease.
Generally, this is a tired appearing, pleasant, jaundiced male in no acute distress.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention noted.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Pulmonary is clear to auscultation except for the bases which have decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema noted.
The MRI of the abdomen that was done for liver workup showed large abdominal ascites, so a second paracentesis at bedside was attempted.
However, only 100 cc of straw-colored fluids with some blood tinged fluid was taken out.
A MRI of the abdomen was obtained showing a cirrhotic liver with a volume of 1479 cc.
Also noted was a question of right accessory hepatic vein.
Also seen was esophageal varices, pseudocysts, left upper pole renal cyst, and large abdominal ascites.
A subsequent abdominal ultrasound revealed that there was no right accessory hepatic vein.
Also done was a transesophageal echocardiogram for transplant workup showing left atrial dilation, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There were no valvular problems or pericardial effusion.
Hepatic encephalopathy secondary to cirrhosis.
Patient was initially continued on his ursodiol, Trental, and lactulose for his hepatic encephalopathy.
However, his Trental was discontinued once he became bacteremic since the Trental was not giving him any beneficial effect, and the roll of Trental during sepsis is unknown, so the medication was discontinued.
Despite lactulose administration, the patient continued to be less oriented, so a CT scan of the head was obtained showing no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Gaseous distention secondary to lactulose use.
Patient's abdomen continued to be distended, but became quite tense during the hospitalization.
A KUB and upright chest x-ray was done showing no free air.
Acute renal failure from acute tubular necrosis likely to prerenal azotemia:  The patient's creatinine was 1.5 upon admission, and did improve to 1.2 with administration of albumin and normal saline.
Hematology/anemia of chronic disease and anemia secondary to blood loss:  Patient's hematocrit did fall down to 26 with guaiac positive stool.
His stool did become guaiac negative, but then became guaiac positive on [**2200-6-9**].
After the MRI showed large abdominal ascites, a second paracentesis was performed with re-entry of the needle to 4-5x.
After the second paracentesis, patient started having right sided abdominal pain.
A CT scan of the abdomen was obtained showing a sense of straining at the right flank and right lower quadrant consistent with a cellulitis.
He was then treated empirically with Vancomycin while his blood cultures on [**2200-5-31**] grew 4/4 bottles with gram-positive cocci.
These organisms were then identified to be group B beta hemolytic Streptococcus and MRSA.
A repeat CT scan of the abdomen was obtained showing fat stranding at the right flank with no worsening cellulitis.
When his white count climbed up to 16, beside being on the appropriate Vancomycin for his MRSA bacteremia, a chest x-ray was obtained on [**6-8**] showing low lung volumes, left upper lobe/lingula loss of translucency consistent with aspiration, and an increased retrocardiac opacity that may be consistent with atelectasis versus consolidation.
Nutrition:  Nutrition was consulted after day of admission, and recommend a placement of a postpyloric feeding tube.
A Speech and Swallow consult was obtained, and a subsequent video swallow study showed that he aspirated a small amount of thin liquids, and a huge amount of regurgitant feeding tube feeds.
His mental status then worsened to a point that Speech and Swallow recommended that he be kept NPO.
