He was hypotensive and received IVF in the ED, and was found to have a dirty UA, elevated WBC, and elevated Tn.
On arrival he was hypotensive and was given additional IVF, then started on levophed.
Neurosurgery felt that the VP shunt was not the cause of infection.

TEE:Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium and moderate echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is a very small (0.3cmx0.3cm) echo dense structure with independent motion on the aortic valve (see image 85) that likely represents a vegetation (cannot exclude other cause such as small papillary fibroelastoma).
There is significant aortic valve stenosis (gradient not assessed in this study).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed with moderate mitral inflow gardient.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Mild to moderate ([**1-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Head CT:Prominently enlarged supratentorial ventricles and coexistent mild peripheral cerebral atrophy.
Dense atherosclerotic disease of the heart and aorta with focal infrarenal 2.7-cm dilation  Discharge labs:  wbc 12.4 hgb 10.8 hct 31.8 plt 223  137 105 11 ------------< 104 3.6 26 1.0   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT/PLAN - 76 y/o male with CHF, AS, a fib, NPH s/p VP shunt, p/w hypotension, fever, and elevated troponin, likely urosepsis transferred to MICU then to wards.
Dif positive stools - The patient was admitted to the MICU with septic shock, with urine being the most likely souce although urine cultures only had < 10,000 organisms.
Blood cultures grew enterococcus faecilis in 2 bottles on [**8-30**].
One bottle from [**9-1**] grew out enterococcus faecilis.
The patient continued to have elevated white counts and with heart murmurs, TEE was done to r/o endocarditis.
The TEE showed small vegetation on aortic valve and patient was so pt has endocarditis.
The patient then developed cough and CXR was done and compared to one on admission, this showed perihilar consolidation and sputum grew out gram neg rods.
The patient was therefore switched back to vanco to treat possible mrsa pna and zosyn to treat g neg rods as well as possible anerobes from aspiration.
Swallow eval done showed that pt was not aspiration risk thereafter.
The patient was afebrile while on the wards except for one day [**9-5**].
He has also had problems with hypotension thought to be due to hypovolemia as patient was diuresed one day and then auto-diuresed after that.
He was volume repleted and BP has been stable at 80-100s/60s.
NSTEMI/troponin leak - Patient with elevated troponin in setting of hypoperfusion from septic shock.
No ekg changes.
Rate under control and held BB for hypotension.
Initially after aggressive diuresis in ICU, pt had pulmonary edema, but this resolved after diuresis.
HTN - all medications held for hypotension.
Dementia - continued aricept; mental status at baseline on discharge.
NPH s/p stent- no active issues.
Patient stil incontinent with dementia and unable to walk without assistance.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Urosepsis, endocarditis, c. dif, pneumonia  Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and afebrile.
Please return to the ED if you experience fever, chills, chest pain, trouble breathing, change in mental status or any other concerning symptoms.
Pleae check gentamycin trough 1 hour after third dose which should be given at 1 pm on [**9-8**].
