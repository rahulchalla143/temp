In endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography suite, he was noted to be tachypneic with saturations of 94 percent on four liters nasal cannula, having emesis of coffee grounds.
He presented to an outside hospital on [**2194-2-12**], with severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting for four days.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrated sludge in his gallbladder, and a thickened gallbladder wall with the common bile duct measuring 8.0 millimeters.
A CT of his abdomen demonstrated moderate pancreatitis with a small amount of ascites.
Currently, in the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography suite, he complains only of thirst and mild nausea as well as some shortness of breath.
He denies chest pain, abdominal pain.
Question of bipolar disease.
Examination is notable for decreased breath sounds at the left base of his lungs.
Chest x-ray with hazy infiltrate in the left lower lobe and a portable KUB with gas still pattern and multiple surgical clips in his left upper quadrant.
No thumb printing.
The plan was to hydrate aggressively, treat his pain with Morphine, start Ceftriaxone and Flagyl, maintain two large bore intravenous at all times, and check blood cultures.
I was called to see the patient for an increased respiratory rate to 40 and 50 with agitation and fatigue.
Over the next hour, he continued to be tachypneic with worsening mental status.
As the patient became increasingly lethargic and unresponsive, I called the patient's sister, [**Name (NI) 8797**] [**Name (NI) 46368**], to obtain consent from anesthesiologist.
However, the patient had copious amounts of emesis of coffee ground material and became bradycardic to the 20s with blood pressure dropping to below the 70s to 80s systolic.
Electroencephalogram on [**2194-2-15**], demonstrated severe encephalopathy and repeat electroencephalogram on [**2194-2-17**], demonstrated nearly no brain activity.
He remained unresponsive entirely during this time.
