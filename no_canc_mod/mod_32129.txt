Wife seemed unable to speak to what the pt would consider as quality of life, rather stated her commitment to caring for her husband and her knowledge of people who have been given poor prognosis and "are out walking in the street now".

Interval ventricular shunt placement with mild decompression of the ventricles.
--------- HEAD CT [**12-20**]: There is no change in the left basal ganglia bleed, which extends into the centrum semiovale superiorly and has surrounding vasogenic edema.
There is persistent compression of the ventricles and midline shift and residual uncal herniation.
There is opacification of the sinuses consistent with intubation.
--------- HEAD AND NECK CTA [**12-20**]: The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent with no evidence of stenosis.
There is no evidence of aneurysm formation or other vascular abnormality.
Impression: Peristent left basal ganglia hemorrhage and mass effect.
No aneurysm or other vascular abnormality.
Final addendum to follow when volume- rendered images are available for evaluation.
Ventriculostomy catheter terminates in the third ventricle with unchanged appearance of the known intraparenchymal hemorrhage and 9 mm of rightward midline shift.
Right scalp soft tissue swelling and fluid collection measuring 12 mm thick, likely secondary to recent ventriculostomy catheter revision.
--------- CT head [**2182-1-9**]: IMPRESSION: Since [**2182-1-2**], minimal decrease in size of the hyperdense component of the left basal ganglia/centrum semiovale hemorrhage but with minimal worsening of the surrounding edema which is causing minimal worsening of the left to right shift of the normally midline structures, now measuring approximately 7 mm.
Tiny amount of blood layering within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
There is diffuse effacement of the left cerebral sulci.
No hydrocephalus or evidence of shunt malfunction is identified.
Hypoattenuation without evidence of acute hemorrhage in the region of old intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left basal ganglia/centrum semiovale ----- CT head ([**2182-2-27**]): IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhages.
No change in ventricular size.
----- CT head ([**2182-3-5**]): IMPRESSION: No short interval change.
No intracranial hemorrhages and stable ventricular size.
----- CT head ([**2182-3-13**]): CONCLUSION: No interval change in the appearances of the ventricular system post-stent placement.
No new abnormality.
====== Video Oropharyngeal Swallow ([**2182-2-8**]): IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate impairment of oral phase; however, there is no penetration or aspiration.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
=============== ECHO [**2181-12-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
======================== EEG [**2181-12-24**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the disorganized, low voltage, and slow background consistent with a marked/severe  encephalopathy which suggests dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, infection, and anoxia are among the common causes of encephalopathy but there are others.
The increased voltage amplitude seen about the C4-P4 and P4-O2 electrode channels likely represent a breach rhythm from a skull defect.
There were no epileptiform features.
No electrographic seizure activity was noted.
---- EEG ([**2182-3-9**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to an intermittent asymmetry between the two hemispheres, with loss of faster frequencies and more prominent delta slowing noted broadly over the left side.
Findings are consistent with an underlying region of cortical and subcortical dysfunction on the left.
In addition, the background was disorganized, poorly modulated and slow with frequent bursts of generalized slowing.
This constellation of findings is consistent with a moderate global encephalopathy, due to dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the common causes of infection.
There were no epileptiform features and no electrographic seizure activity was noted.
----- EEG ([**2182-3-14**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the low voltage fast and disorganized background with intermittent bursts of moderate  amplitude generalized mixed frequency slowing consistent with a mild encephalopathy suggesting dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the common causes of encephalopathy but there are others.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathic patterns can sometimes obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features.
His hospital course by problem is as follows:  1) Neuro / L basal ganglia bleed: - He was very hypertensive and his mechanism for bleeding was felt to be likely secondary to this.
A CTA showed no vascular abnormalities.
- sustained clonus was noted on multiple occasions on the right side and occasionally misinterpreted as seizure activity, but this was then followed by some reports of facial twitching and an EEG was obtained.
The EEG was not suggestive of epileptiform activity, but due to increasing somnolence (thought to be in part related to depression from being in the hospital for so long)that could have been related to seizure activity (that might be too deep to have been picked up by EEG), the decision was made to start him on Keppra.
- Provigil was trialed with regard to his increasing somnolence, but there was no benefit from this.
Lexapro provided little benefit, and psychiatry believed that a lack of response to ritalin made one lean away from the diagnosis of depression and more toward a diffuse encephalopathic state entered after his large hemorrhage.
2) The patient had an extraventricular drain (EVD) placed by the neurosurgical service for hydrocephalus.
4) The patient's decreased arrousal and decreased mobility was felt to put him at risk for an aspiration event.
5) Hypertension was also a major area of concern during this admission.
Etiology of this was not well known, and further workup included a renal ultrasound in order to rule out renal artery stenosis (found to be negative).
He was markedly abulic and barely interactive, with terse answers and limited interaction, and a stable, dense R hemiplegia.
There were no further in-hospital complications.
7) He was evaluated by psychiatry on [**2182-3-11**] for a question depression, and it was felt that depressive symptoms more often seen in left hemisphere strokes.
Aphasia by itself can lead to depression especially if too many motor deficits elements given the frustration of not being able to communicate one's thoughts and feelings in words.
Regarding activating medication like Provigil, it was of no effect and discontinued - as outlined above.
Abulia 4.
There is a right facial droop.
The right side of the body is densely paretic with increased tone.
Please report to the nearest ER or call 911 or your PCP immediately when you experience recurrence of weakness, numbness, tingling, problems with vision, speech, language, walking, thinking, headache, or difficulties arousing, or any other signs or symptoms of concern.
