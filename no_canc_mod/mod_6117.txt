Admission Date:  [**2146-7-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2146-7-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2084-5-9**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Transplant Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62-year-old male with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis since [**2145-5-5**]), and has been on the kidney transplant list for the past three months.
The patient reports doing well without any complaints.
A thallium study showed a small area of ischemia in the high lateral wall.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus since the age of 40.
Left arteriovenous graft; working well.
In general, in no acute distress.
No jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Back revealed there was no costovertebral angle tenderness or spinal tenderness.
Extremity examination revealed there was no edema.
There were venous stasis changes.
The left arm had an arteriovenous graft thrill.
Decreased reflexes bilaterally symmetrically in the lower extremities.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed some fullness around the mediastinum.
There were no infiltrates.
There were small Q waves in leads I and aVL.
Echocardiogram in [**2145-12-5**] revealed an ejection fraction of 55% with trace mitral regurgitation.
A stress thallium in [**2145-12-5**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 34313**] indicated a small area of ischemia in the high lateral wall.
A chest computed tomography indicated mediastinal fullness secondary to adipose tissue.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62-year-old male with end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes and hypertension who presented on [**2146-7-23**] for a cadaveric renal transplant.
Postoperatively, in the Recovery Room, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures running in the 70s to 90s.
An electrocardiogram revealed no ischemic changes.
The patient was placed on a dopamine drip running between 2 mcg/kg and 5 mcg/kg per minute with minimal resolution of hypotension and anuria/oliguria.
Repeat arterial blood gases showed marked improvement.
Cardiology did not believe that the patient had a myocardial infarction, but they continued to monitor him closely.
Given the patient's delayed graft function, slight increase in troponin level were not unexpected by the Renal team.
A chest x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions, a moderate-sized pleural effusion on the right side.
The patient had a short course of levofloxacin.
Given his x-ray with a significant pleural effusion, we could not rule out an infiltrate.
This antibiotic was discontinued by the time of discharge, and his chest x-ray showed marked improvement.
End-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes and hypertension.
Hypotension most likely secondary to anesthesia.
Postoperative hypoxemia.
Postoperative hyperkalemia; resolved after dialysis.
Ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
