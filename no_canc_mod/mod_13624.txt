Admission Date:  [**2134-5-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-5-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-11-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from OSH for CHF symptoms and Type B aortic dissection seen on CTA  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: CC:[**CC Contact Info 56848**].
Post operatively a [**Company 1543**] Sigma SDR303 B pacemaker was placed due to complete heart block.
The patient subsequently had a generator change due to the recent [**Company 1543**] advisory in [**Month (only) 956**] of this year.
She was admitted 2 days ago to [**Hospital1 **] with SOB and worsening exertional chest pressure.
Of note, Mrs. [**Known lastname 6818**] states that she has had generally stable exertional SOB and chest pressure lasting for 30 minutes at a time ever since her [**2131**] surgery.
At baseline, she uses a wheelchair due to extremely poor exercise tolerance.
She states that over the last several months, she has had worsening symptoms, with significant DOE with minimal exertion.
At the OSH, she was found to be hemodynamically stable with decreased breath sounds.
A CTA was ordered to rule out PE and demonstrated a large descending aortic aneurysm.
CXR demonstrated mild cardiac enlargement and mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
Films from the OSH were reviewed with radiology this evening and revealed a persistent, large aortic aneurysm from the distal end of her 30mm graft extending to below the margins of the film (below the renal arteries).
The aneurysm had a very small lumen.
In house, her CXR confirmed mild pulmonary edema, and BNP was 2300.
HTN Breast reduction surgery Cholecystectomy Foot surgery TAH/BSO Arthritis PM for complete heart block (s/p arrest post operatively [**9-15**])   Social History: Lives with husband and daughter.

2/6 SEM, no rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**] LUNGS: soft bibasilar crackles, No W/R ABD: Soft, NT, ND.
No HSM EXT: No edema.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
A mobile density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Supravalvular aortography was performed after gaining arterial access via the RFA.
Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system demonstrated no significant CAD.
The RCA was non-dominant with a small rPDA and no rPL.
Left ventriculography was deferred due to high filling pressures.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP=51 mmHg and mean PCWP=42 mmHg.
She demonstrated a 25 mmHg pulsus paradoxus with concomitant fall in RV pressure, indicating a very low liklihood of constrictive physiology.
As well, there was marked respiratory variation in the RA and PASP of >55 mmHg, also arguing against constrictive physiology.
Full shunt run demonstrated no evidence of significant intracardiac shunting.
Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
No evidence of constrictive physiology.
No evidence of intracardiac shunt.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
CTA Chest/Abd/Pelvis: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is an aortic dissection, which extends from the region of the junction of the ascending aorta and aortic arch and extends inferiorly down to the iliac bifurcation.
There is no evidence of a mediastinal hematoma or aortic rupture.
There is a left-sided pacer in place with surrounding subcutaneous air and a hematoma.
There is delayed enhancement of the false lumen within the descending aorta, with near equal mixture of contrast more inferiorly, suggesting possible prior dissection fenestration procedure.
There are no pleural effusions.
There is a calcified granuloma within the left lower lobe.
There is a 4-mm noncalcified pulmonary nodule within the right lower lobe (series 5, image 45).
There are prominent bilateral axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes.
There are scattered paraaortic retroperitoneal and mesenteric nodes.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Stranding is identified within the right groin consistent with recent catheterization.
There are scattered, non- pathologically enlarged inguinal nodes bilaterally.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
IMPRESSION: Aortic dissection extending from the junction of the ascending aorta and aortic arch down to the level of the iliac bifurcation.
No evidence of aortic rupture or aneurysm.
CT Head: FINDINGS: No evidence of hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation appears preserved and there is no evidence of acute cortical territorial infarct.
Visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage.
CT C-spine: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intraspinal or soft tissue hemorrhage within the neck.
No acute fracture or spondylolisthesis is seen.
There is no evidence of abnormal prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
Mild degenerative changes are noted within the cervical spine with endplate changes and osteophyte formation seen at the C4-5 and C5-6 levels.
There is no evidence of canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
Visualized portions of the lung apices appear unremarkable.
There is evidence of mucosal thickening, and likely mucus retention cyst within the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intraspinal or soft tissue hemorrhage within the neck.
Mild degenerative change is noted within the cervical spine.
Neuro Consult for Headaches: Impression: Patient is a 43 year old woman with complicated past cardiac history with history of ascending aortic dissection status post AVR and graft, complete heart block, congestive heart failure, with admission for dyspnea.
Now with occipital tension type headaches with marked cervical and trapezii spasm.
Exam consistent with cervical spondylosis with spasm, bilateral C5 root signs, and mild myelopathic signs in lower extremities.
Given preserved consciousness, onset and character of headaches, and lack of other signs on exam, doubt subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Recs: -Soft cervical collar and hard pillow qHS -NSAIDs or other antiinflammatory for pain relief in place of narcotics -Continue Valium (try 2 mg tid standing as not as sedating) or can substitue Skelaxin 800 mg po tid or Flexeril 5-10 mg po tid for neck spasm -CT C spine to rule out acute disc herniation -Heat and/or massage to the neck might be helpful -If there remains concern for aneurysm and subarachnoid bleed, CTA of the head is reportedly 95% sensitive for this but would not be able to rule it out completely   Brief Hospital Course: # Ischemia: Had cardiac catheterization to r/o ischemic etiology of CHF, which demonstrated clean coronaries.
# Pump: CHF thought most likely to be due to cardioplegia stemming from prior dissection and valve surgery.
Decision made to pursue BiV pacer and ICD placement due to low EF and possible dysynchrony seen on TTE.
This was done on [**5-14**], and was complicated by moderate sized pacer pocket hematoma for which anticoagulation was transiently held.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6818**] also had markedly elevated right-sided pressures on cardiac cath, with PCWP 42, and was aggressively diuresed for several days.
Complicated by moderate hematoma in pacer pocket, heparin transiently held.
No evidence of functional occlusion of [**Female First Name (un) 899**], SMA, or renal arteries, as pt was making good urine and had no signs of bowel ischemia.
Managed medically, with no immediate surgical indications.
[**Female First Name (un) **] for f/u CTA and appointment with [**Female First Name (un) 1106**] surgery as outpatient.
# Headaches: Mrs. [**Known lastname 6818**] experienced occipital HA for the last 3-4 days prior to d/c.
A head and neck CT demonstrated no evidence of bleeding, and had no neurological findings suggestive of SAH.
She did have notable trapezius spasm, and was treated symptomatically with tylenol and cyclobenzaprine.
Diazepam 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for headache, muscle spasm for 7 days: DO not take if your are taking Flexeril.
