Admission Date:  [**2122-6-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-6-18**]   Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Demerol / Codeine / Zyprexa  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Mechanical fall from wheel chair with subdural hematoma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2122-6-12**] Right craniotomy for evacuation of hemorrhage   History of Present Illness: This is an 88 year old woman who had a mechanical fall out of a wheelchair today.
She developed nasuea, emesis and confusion and was intubated there.
She was on plavix but [**Hospital **] Hospital claimed to have no platelets for transfusion.
Past Medical History: Atrial Fibrillation HTN Heart surgery at age 23 DM Mental disorder NEC   Social History: Lives in nursing facility.
+cough +gag, weak corneal relfexes   Pertinent Results: Laboratory: [**2122-6-11**] 04:00PM   WBC-15.9* RBC-4.35 HGB-13.7 HCT-40.8 MCV-94 MCH-31.5 MCHC-33.6 RDW-12.9  Imaging: [**2122-6-11**] OSH CT Head without Contrast: Large right SDH and interhemispheric SDH with some midline shift.
No facial bone fracture.
Large right frontal scalp subgaleal hematoma.
Mild mucosal thickening within the paranasal sinuses.
Severe multilevel degenerative changes with moderate spinal canaln narrowing at C4-5 and C5-6.
Status post right frontal craniotomy and evacuation of right subdural hematoma with reduction in mass effect and decreased shift of normally midline structures compared to the prior examination, now with a 3 mm leftward shift, previously 10 mm.
Hyperdense material within the right subdural hematoma and layering along the falx appears consistent with residual hematoma.
Expected postoperative changes at the site of evacuation with blood products and pneumocephalus noted.
Upper zone redistribution and interstitial edema.
Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation slightly progressed  [**6-14**] CXR: The endotracheal tube tip is 5 cm above the carina, appropriately sited.
There is a nasogastric tube whose tip and side port are below the GE junction.
There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity and left-sided pleural effusion.
There is mild prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
There are no pneumothoraces.
Multiple calcified opacities projecting over the left upper quadrant might represent calcified splenic artery aneurysms.
As compared to prior radiograph, there is interval dilatation of the upper mediastinum, reason is unclear.
Please correlate with recent attempt of central venous placing and if there is any possibility of trauma, evaluation of the patient with CT of the chest is required.
Bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was transferred, intubated, to [**Hospital1 18**] ED from OSH [**2122-6-11**] after imaging revealed large subdural hematoma.
Repeat Head CT in the ED, revealed expansion of SDH with worsening mass effect.
Her systolic blood pressure was maintained below 140 and loaded on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
On [**2122-6-12**], the patient was taken to the OR, intubated for right craniotomy with evacuation of subdural hematoma.
CXR showed possible pulmonary edema and lasix 10mg IV was given.
The incision was clean and dry dissolvable sutures were intact.
