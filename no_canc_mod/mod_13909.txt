Head  CT showed an area of hypodensity in R MCA territory with perfusion deficits.
CTA showed occlusion in M1.
Repeat head CT showed extensive R MCA territory infarct, with edema, resulting in compression of the R lateral [**Doctor Last Name 534**], but no evidence of hemorrhagic conversion or herniation.
Her infarct was likely secondary to an embolic event in the context of being subtherapeutic on Coumadin prior to her recent cataract surgery.
