The pain resolved after 30 minutes and improved with TUMS.
He has had 2 subsequent episodes of chest pain not clearly associated with eating, but denies any shortness of breath, or association with exercise.no nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis.
Shortly after arrival to the ED his pain resolved and he has been angina free since.
On ROS he complains of dyspnea [**1-6**] deconditioning following fall between truck and dock 2 years ago with fracturing of L leg.
He is able to walk [**12-8**] mile or two flights of stairs before experiencing shortness of breath.

S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

EXTREMITIES: Diffuse thick swelling of right lower leg.
No femoral bruits.

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the entire ventricle with the exception of the basal inferior, inferolateral and anterolateral walls..
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
Small loculated pericardial effusion adjacent to the inferolateral wall with no evidence of tamponade.
Severely depressed left ventricular function.
The pericardial effusion is slightly larger.
Brief Hospital Course: Following admission he had recurrent angina and Heparin was started.
Catheterization was performed, which revealed triple vessel disease, and elevated LVEDP.
No ventriculogram was performed given his renal dysfunction.He was referred for cardiac surgical evaluation.
Echocardiography demonstrated an EF of 20-25%, with mild pulmonary hypertension.
He had elevated PA pressures, with hyperexpanded lungs.
He developed rapid atrial fibrillation associated with unstable hemodynamics the night after surgery and Amiodarone was begun with restoration of sinus rhythm.
He had a significant amount of peripheral edema and wheezing with fluid overload which was treated with bronchodilators and diuresis.
recurrent atrial fibrillation developed and Amiodarone was reloaded and oral begun.
He was placed on Keflex for serosanguinous sternal incision drainage which was minimal at the times of discharge.
He had no sternal click and no sternal erythema on his discharge exam.
