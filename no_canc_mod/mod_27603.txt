This pregnancy was notable for spontaneous monochorionic- diamniotic twins.
On the day of delivery, she developed unstoppable preterm labor with advancing cervical dilatation and was taken to primary cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Soft systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, normal S1, S2, femoral pulses +2.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nondistended, nontender, no masses.
Large bilateral hydroceles.
On day     of life #1, he had a pulmonary hemorrhage and was     transitioned to the high frequency oscillator ventilator.
He was treated for apnea     of prematurity with caffeine which was discontinued on     [**2183-5-11**].
His last episode of spontaneous     bradycardia occurred on [**2183-7-15**].
An echocardiogram on [**2183-3-11**] showed     a moderate PDA and a dilated left ventricle.
On [**2183-3-19**], he underwent     a patent ductus arteriosus ligation at [**Hospital1 62374**].
He has recently in     the last few weeks prior to discharge noted to have     episodes of hypertension with systolic blood pressures     greater than 110 mm Hg.
A renal ultrasound was performed     showing normal kidneys with some nephrocalcinosis.
The repeat swallow study on     [**2183-7-17**] shows no aspiration, and [**Known lastname **] was allowed     to p.o.
Serum electrolytes were checked at     numerous junctures during his intensive care course and     except for some mild hyponatremia were within normal     limits.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Due to his prematurity and preterm     labor, [**Known lastname **] was evaluated for sepsis at the time of     admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.
On day of life #29, due to some hypothermic     issues, he was again reevaluated for sepsis with a blood     culture.
On day of life #51, [**2183-4-28**],     he had a fever spike to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.
The blood culture     was no growth.
A herpes simplex virus preliminary chain     reaction specimen was negative, and the acyclovir was     discontinued.
Also, at the time     of his pulmonary hemorrhage he was treated with fresh     frozen plasma.
GASTROINTESTINAL: [**Known lastname **] required treatment for     unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
As noted, [**Known lastname **]     had significant feeding problems.
[**Name (NI) **] was also treated for     gastroesophageal reflux and is being discharged home on     omeprazole and metoclopramide.
NEUROLOGY: [**Known lastname **] had a head ultrasound on day of life #2     that showed bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage with a     parenchymal hemorrhage.
A follow-up scan on [**2183-3-12**] showed bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage and a     cerebellar hemorrhage.
A head ultrasound on [**2183-5-27**]     showed the resolving IVH with periventricular cysts and     increased extra-axial fluid.
A subsequent scan on [**2183-6-11**] showed an 8 mm right matter cyst and persistence of     the extra-axial fluid.
Repeat scan on [**2183-6-25**] was     without change.
OPHTHALMOLOGY: [**Known lastname **] had several exams screening for retinopathy of prematurity.
[**Known lastname **] was     observed in his car seat for 90 minutes without any     episodes of oxygen desaturation or bradycardia.
Immunizations recommended: A) Synagis RSV prophylaxis     should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for     infants who meet any of the following 4 criteria: 1) born     at less than 32 weeks; 2) born between 32 and 35 weeks     with 2 of the following: Daycare during RSV season, a     smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway     abnormalities, or school-aged siblings; 3) chronic lung     disease; or 4) hemodynamically significant congenital     heart disease.
Before this age and for the first 24     months of the child's life, immunization against     influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-     of-home caregivers.
