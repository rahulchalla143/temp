After her tracheal stents were put in by interventional pulmonology, patient continued to have greatly increased secretions which she was unable to clear.
It became clear over the ensuing days that patient stents were causing more problems due to increased secretions and increased difficulty clearing the secretions, than they were able to relieve her shortness of breath secondary to tracheomalacia.
Stent removal was postponed due to GI problems as summarized below.
The patient developed nausea and constipation on [**1-5**].
A KUB was obtained which showed significant fecal distension to approximately 14 cm with overall colonic distension.
There was no evidence of physical obstruction.
Based on this x-ray, patient was felt to have colonic obstruction or a functional ileus secondary to bed rest and general medical comorbidity.
Serial KUBs demonstrated no significant change in colonic distension over the forthcoming days and colonoscopy/colonic decompression was performed.
This had a mild effect, showing some minor decompression of the colon.
Of note, patient never complained of any abdominal pain and although bowel sounds were greatly decreased and abdomen was distended, there was never felt to be any evidence of an acute abdomen.
Over the next days patient developed normal bowel movements after a short course of diarrhea and was able to tolerate a full liquid diet.
It is felt that patient has a significant degree of chronic colonic distension.
The patient has had chronic anemia over the past weeks with slow drop in hematocrit.
She has no evidence of hemolysis and stools became guaiac positive only when colonic distension ensued and her ileus.
Other than that she has also had bleeding sources from hemoptysis and a vaginal bleed.
At the time of this dictation, patient's hematocrit has been stable for the past few days and she has had no obvious bleeding source.
It is felt that patient had anemia of chronic disease with depressed marrow due to her comorbidities and that her blood loss is due to phlebotomy and small volume blood loss from hemoptysis, lower GI bleeding and past vaginal bleeding.
The patient developed vaginal bleed around approximately [**1-8**].
On further inspection it was found that the bleeding was from the urethra and urology was consulted.
They felt this was most likely urethritis related to Foley and trauma and the bleeding was exacerbated by Lovenox.
