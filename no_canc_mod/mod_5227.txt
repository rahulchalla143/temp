The patient initially presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] early on the morning of [**2-1**] with complaint of chest pain radiating to the left upper extremity associated with throat tightness, nausea, diaphoresis, and dizziness.
He denied shortness of breath.
He stated that the pain was exacerbated by deep inspiration.
At [**Hospital6 3105**], electrocardiograms there showed 2-mm ST elevations and peaked T waves in the inferior leads, T wave inversions, and ST depressions, and small Q waves in I and aVL, peaked T waves in V5 and V6, RSR prime in V1 to V3 suggestive of posterior involvement.
T wave inversions in V1 and V2, and ST depressions in V3 through V5.
A right-sided electrocardiogram showed no changes in V4.
There is no documentation of which of these interventions rendered him pain free.
Per the patient, the total duration of pain lasted one hour.
He was also noted to be bradycardic to the 30s and had one episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
He had no evidence of failure.
He was transferred to the floor but continued to have recurrent episodes of chest pain, controlled with titration of his nitroglycerin drip and morphine.
On history, the patient denies having chest pain prior to this episode.
He denies having had exertional symptoms in the past.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, he does complain of throat tightness and dysphagia for three years.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Father with cerebrovascular accident in his 60s and diabetes.
No family history of early coronary artery disease.
In general, the patient appeared in mild distress.
Neck revealed no jugular venous distention, lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly or masses.
A fourth heart sound gallop.
A nondisplaced point of maximal impulse.
Gastrointestinal revealed soft, nontender, and nondistended, and no hepatosplenomegaly or masses, normal active bowel sounds.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Assessment revealed a 47-year-old male with no prior cardiac history, positive smoking history, presenting from an outside hospital with inferoposterior myocardial infarction.
ISCHEMIA:  The patient was admitted with 2/10 chest pain on arrival which was controlled with titration of nitroglycerin drip and morphine, which resolved his pain in 20 minutes.
He was maintained on aspirin, nitroglycerin drip, heparin drip, Integrilin, Zestril, and Lipitor and was stable overnight with no recurrence of chest pain.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization the next day which revealed a middle left circumflex 90% lesion which was stented, and third obtuse marginal stenosis which received angioplasty.
A left ventriculography showed an ejection fraction of 60% and mild inferior hypokinesis.
A beta blocker was held secondary to persistent bradycardia in the 50s.
PUMP:  The patient with no evidence of failure on examination on admission.
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY:  The patient with asymptomatic sinus bradycardia throughout his hospitalization preventing initiation of beta blocker.
He had no ectopic events during his hospitalization.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient with a normal hematocrit but low mean cell volume.
Iron panel was suggestive of anemia of chronic disease picture.
Given the patient's longstanding complaints of throat tightness and dysphagia, there was some concern for malignancy which will need to be investigated as an outpatient.
Inferoposterior myocardial infarction.
