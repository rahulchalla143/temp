Admission Date:  [**2185-8-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-9-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2119-3-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: transfer from surgical ICU for cavitary pneumonia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy G-tube placement Intubation   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 69575**] is a 66 year old man with a history of oxygen and steroid dependent COPD, HTN, type II diabetes,  Pt has had multiple admissions for COPD exacerbations, most recently presenting to an OSH mid-[**2185-6-18**] for this.
He was found to have bilateral upper lobe infiltrates and lymphadenopathy on a chest CT.  Sputum grew out Pseudomonas and he was treated with cefepime and a steroid taper.
On [**2185-8-14**] he re-presented to [**Hospital1 1562**] with 3 days of DOE, fevers, and sweats, with a cough productive of brown sputum.
He quickly developed further respiratory distress and required ICU transfer and intubation.
BAL was negative for AFB, culture grew out pseudomonas and another GNR.
Past Medical History: Type II Diabetes O2-dependent COPD H/O pancreatic pseudocyst s/p CCY Psoriasis Alcohol abuse   Social History: Pt was born in [**State 531**] City.
Pul: Poor air movem't, scant wheezes, no crackles.
Pertinent Results: Path: "Vegetable material consistent with corn or pea."
No ST/T changes.
There are bilateral upper lobe consolidations with probable cavitation in the left upper lobe.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
[**8-17**] CXR: Bilateral upper lobe consolidation, likely infectious etiology.
[**2185-8-19**]: Allowing for difference in technique, bilateral apical opacities and upper lobe cavitation appear unchanged.
No new consolidations are evident.
No pulmonary vascular congestion or right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax is evident.
No pneumothorax is present.
[**2185-8-21**] CXR: The right subclavian line has been withdrawn and now lies in the mid SVC.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Distribution of bowel gas is unremarkable with gas present throughout the colon and in the rectum and no free intraperitoneal gas.
No soft tissue masses or radiopaque calculi.
IMPRESSION: No diagnostic abnormality.
[**2185-8-25**] CXR: Biapical cavitary lesions are essentially unchanged, however worsening right lower lobe consolidation.
[**2185-8-26**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Rightward axis - is nonspecific and may be within normal limits.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2185-8-27**] CXR: Interval increase in bilateral upper lobe opacities as well as in the right lower lungs.
Findings likely represent worsening of infection.
There is also hazy increased opacity in the right lower lobe that could represent focal infiltrate in that region.
[**2185-8-29**] CXR: Mild increase in left upper lobe opacity.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**2185-8-30**] CXR: Large areas of cavitary destruction or pneumatocele formation in the right upper lung, which have progressed since [**8-17**] are now marginated by increasingly-severe consolidation in the right upper lobe extending to the minor fissure and worsening pneumonia in the right lower lobe.
Cavitary consolidation in the left upper lobe now contains more fluid.
Small right pleural effusion has increased.
ECG [**2185-8-30**]: Sinus tachycardia and frequent atrial ectopy.
Low precordial lead voltage.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2185-8-26**] frequent atrial ectopy has appeared.
Otherwise, chest findings are unchanged and no pneumothorax has developed.
CXR [**2185-9-2**]: Relatively stable radiograph with large right upper lobe cavitary lesion persisting and subtle improved aeration of surrounding consolidation.
CT Head [**2185-9-3**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Please note that MRI is more sensitive for detection of acute stroke.
Multifocal areas of consolidation in the right lung as well as in the left upper lobe show slight interval improvement, particularly in the right mid and lower lung regions.
Underlying cystic spaces are present in both upper lobes and may be due to pre-existing bullous emphysema, although a component of cavitary pneumonia is not fully excluded.
Bilateral pneumonia within the entire right upper lung lobe, superior segment of the right lower lung lobe, and throughout the left upper lung lobe, with adjacent involved large bullous destructive lung changes.
These findings are highly concerning for a necrotizing pneumonia.
No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
[**9-7**] ECG: Normal sinus rhythm with occasional atrial premature beat.
Non-specific ST-T wave flattening.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2185-8-30**] no diagnostic interval change.
[**2185-9-9**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia and frequent atrial ectopy.
Delayed R wave progression.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2185-9-7**] no diagnostic interim change.
[**2185-9-10**]: Sinus rhythm with PACs.
Anteroseptal T wave changes are nonspecific.
There is extensive bilateral consolidation, with bullous destructive changes and air bronchograms, consistent with cavitary pneumonia, unchanged in comparison to the prior study.
Changes within the pancreas are consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
CXR [**2185-9-19**]: Slight worsening of multilobar pneumonia with associated underlying bullous disease and apparent cavitation.
Patient demonstrated mild oropharyngeal dysphagia with mild penetration, however, no definite evidence of aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 69575**] is a 66 year old man with history of COPD on home O2, steroids, presenting with cavitary pneumonia and respiratory failure.
# Pneumonia: On admission the patient's records from the OSH from which he was transferred were reviewed.
Per old imaging ([**5-/2185**]) pt had a small apical bullae, but no cavitary lesions until his CT [**2185-8-14**].
Given the patient's alcohol history and the evidence of food in his RUL, the most likely etiology of the patient's pneumonia was felt to be aspiration along with possible recurrence of pseudomonas.
Serial sputum cultures initially demonstrated pseudomonas sensitive to zosyn.
However, sputum cultures on [**2185-8-25**] demonstrated pseudomonas resistant to zosyn.
On this regimens, the patient continued to have low grade fevers, though his respiratory status improved as below.
On [**9-19**], patient developed hemoptysis with increased respiratory effort.
Pulmonology was consulted; bronchoscopy performed [**9-20**], which showed frank blood from the right upper lobe.
No intervention was performed.
On [**9-21**], the bleeding had decreased in quantity, and by [**9-23**], bleeding only occurred with suctioning.
# Diarrhea.
The patient developed diarrhea during his admission.
# Hyperglycemia: On admission the patient was apparently on home lantus though his diabetes history could be obtained.
# Anemia: hematocrit low but stable.
Iron studies showed increased ferritin, decreased TIBC, low iron, c/w anemia of chronic disease.
# HTN: On admisison the patient had no known history of hypertension, though his SBP's were in the 160's here.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Pseudomonal Pneumonia Diabetes severe COPD h/o alcohol abuse Aspiration Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: stable on 50% trach mask, eating solid foods, working with PT   Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications and make all appointments as listed hospital if you have worsening fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening bleeding from tracheostomy site.
