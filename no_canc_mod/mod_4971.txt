EKG revealed increased ST elevations in V1-V3 similar to EKG changes when he presented for his [**6-27**] admission.
During cardiac catheterization, he had hypertensive urgency with a peak SBP in the 200s.
He had flash pulmonary edema and tachycardia necessitating intubation.
In the cath lab, he was found to have stable 3 vessel disease with patent LAD stents.
Past Medical History: CAD--h/o 3 vessel disease (LAD and LCx), s/p multiple DES in [**6-21**] and [**3-22**], D1: 80% stenosis, Lcx: 80% proximal stenosis, RCA: 60% ostial stenosis ESRD on HD--secondary to diabetic nephropathy, also has h/o dye-induced nephropathy.
Started HD [**3-/2185**] and currently being evaluated for transplant.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: Obese, soft, + mild distention, nontender, no rebound/rigidity/guarding.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Right groin has access sheath in place, no bleeding or hematoma, no bruit.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Absent heart sounds, peripheral pulses, and no spontaneous respirations.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 64yo male with known 3vD who was admitted for SOB and angina.
His EKG showed anteroseptal ischemia and his troponin was positive.
On cardiac catheterization he had stable 3VD with a patent LAD stent.
The patient was awaiting CABG pending resolution of recent fevers and elevated INR.
# CAD/Ischemia: The patient had 3 vessel disease with recurrent episodes of ischemia.
He had multiple stents in the LAD and stenoses in D1, LCx, RCA.
His EKG showed anteroseptal ischemia.
He was brought for cardiac catheterization, during it he had hypertensive urgency with peak SBP in 200s.
He had flash pulmonary edema and tachycardia necessitating intubation.
On cath, he was found to have stable 3 vessel disease with patent LAD stents.
The patient was seen by surgery who suggested CABG pending resolution of fever and a normal INR.
In the late morning the patient developed pulseless Vtach and compressions were started within seconds.
# Pump: The patient had an echo during his last admission that revealed EF <20% and apical left ventricular aneurysm.
Though he does not appear significantly fluid overloaded, he had episode of hypertensive urgency likely secondary to poor systolic function and stiff ventricles.
A repeat echo during this admission showed slightly improved LV systolic funciton with an EF of 20-25%.
# Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated in the setting of hypertensive urgency and flash pulmonary edema.
He later received HD to help with fluid removal.
# HTN: The patient had SBP in the 200s during cath which resolved with intubation and with a nitro gtt.
#Infection: The patient was having shaking chills early in his admission and received a CT of the head without contrast which showed no intracranial process.
He was febrile and had increased WBCs.
His HD site was being followed as there was question as to whether he had some puss at the site.
For his fever, shaking chills, and abdominal distension her received a RUQ u/s which was unremarkable and without evidence of cholecystitis.
# ESRD: The patient had ESRD and was on HD.
He was being evaluated for renal transplant.
