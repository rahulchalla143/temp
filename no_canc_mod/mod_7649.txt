Allowing for this, no central pulmonary embolism is seen.
Atherosclerotic calcifications involve the aortic arch and its branches, though they are of normal caliber.
Cardiomegaly persists without evidence for pericardial or pleural effusion.
Atherosclerotic coronary calcification is again observed.
Scattered prominent mediastinal nodes are noted, the largest paratracheal node measuring up to 10 mm in short axis, smaller compared to [**2136-9-17**] when it measured up to 13 mm.
Lung windows reveal mild hypoventilatory changes at the lung bases bilaterally.
An approximately 6-mm ground-glass nodule in the left upper lobe (3:32) is not seen on the prior study.
A 4 mm nodule is in the right lower lobe (3:52).
Endplate erosion and sclerotic change at T9/10 again may represent sequelae of prior infection, unchanged.
Limited evaluation without evidence for central pulmonary embolism.
Small nodules in the lower lobes bilaterally.
If there is history of malignancy or risk factors for malignancy, follow-up in 6 months is recommended.
CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process or signs of CHF.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Poor R wave progression.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-10-5**] sinus tachycardia is new.
TACHYCARDIA: Occured while on dialysis in the setting of fluid removal.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been initiated by volume removal, however likely has an abberant atrial focus for her tachydardia.
She has baseline low blood pressures but remained stable.
H/O THORMBOSES, ANTICOAGULATION: Multiple venous thrombosis.
HD was continued in house with no futher episodes of tachycardia.
