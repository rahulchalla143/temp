Patient was admitted to OSH on [**7-4**] with tachycardia admitted to CCU with HR 160, narrow complex, CP [**6-22**], a/w SOB, O2 sats 88%-->97-98% on 2L NC.
Patient then had a second episode of SVT on [**7-8**], recieved Adenosine 6 mg then 12 mg and converted again.
He reports [**2-14**] lifetime episodes, each time a/w chest pressure and shortness of breath, which started a few months ago while at a rehab facility.
Patient denies CP or pressure otherwise.
He has shortness of breath a/w COPD and abdominal distension and noticed increased LE edema over the past few months requiring increasing doses of lasix and prompting recent admission on [**6-10**] to same OSH.
Denies any CP, cough, sob, sputum production, N/V, abdominal pain or other complaints at this time.
Past Medical History: - etoh cirrhosis (per OSH) with h/o hepatic encephalopathy - portal hypertension +/- esophageal varices - HCV - CRF - AOCD - +TOB - LE edema - COPD - T3 hypothyroidism - h/o thrombocytopenia - DJD - h/o PNA, bronchitis .
Unclear how he contracted Hep C. Smokes few cigarettes per day, ppd x 45 yrs, no IVDA.
Family History: Etoh abuse, hyperlipidemia, thyroid disease, anemia  Physical Exam: VS: 99.7 98/46 89 18 99% RA Ht 6'0" Wt 180 lbs Gen: ill appearing male, NAD HEENT: OP clear and moist, edentulous, slightly icteric, EOMI Neck: supple, no LAD, no JVD Chest: diffusely poor air entry, no BS at bases ~1/3 up CVS: nl S1 S2, RRR, no m/r/g Abd: distended, soft, NT x 4, diffuse echymoses and prominent veins, +ventral hernia ~5x5 cm, ?fluid wave, NABS, unable to appreciate any hepatosplenomegaly Ext: warm bilaterally, symmetric calves, 2+ pulses, decreased sensations b/l in feet, 1+ edema b/l to mid calf.
MICRO: HEPATITIS C VIRUS RNA BY PCR, QUALITATIVE   Test                          Result HCV RNA, QUAL, PCR            NOT DETECTED .
IMAGING: [**2105-7-10**] ABDOMINAL U/S: IMPRESSION: Cirrhotic liver with moderate ascites and patent forward portal venous flow.
No hepatic masses on this limited exam.
Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2105-7-10**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
Possible left anterior fascicular block.
No previous tracing available for comparison .
[**2105-7-13**] CXR PA&LAT: Dialysis catheter remains in place with the distal lower tip within the right atrium, unchanged.
There is slight worsening of opacity in the right lower lobe, particularly in the right retrocardiac region, which has an adjacent linear component.
This may be due to either atelectasis or pneumonia.
Small right pleural effusion is also noted on the lateral view.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 59 yo M with cirrhosis of unclear etiology (?HepC), CRF on HD, anemia, HepC, hypothyroidism, and SVT controlled with rate control admitted for continued management of renal failure and liver transplant evaluation.
Patient had two episodes of SVT at OSH which both converted with adenosine.
His ECHO also showed a normal EF, without any wall motion abnormalities.
# CIRRHOSIS: Unclear etiology of patient's liver cirrhosis.
Patient transferred here for further evaluation of cirrhosis and management.
Pt had several episodes of hypotension requiring several boluses of 250cc NS.
# FEVER: Patient had a Tmax of 102.3 at the OSH and had one episode of a mild fever with chills and SOB.
CXR demonstrated question of right lower lobe infiltrate and patient was started on cefepime and vancomycin to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia.
Repeat PA and Lat done which also noted RLL infiltrate.
# CRF on HD.
Patient's renal failure was though to be secondary to hepatorenal syndrome, although urine Na was 20 on admission.
Patient was noted to be anemic at OSH with Hct of 26.6.
Patient's anemia likely multifactorial in etiology - anemia of chronic disease and question of slow GI bleed given likely portal gastropathy.
# Hypothyroidism.
