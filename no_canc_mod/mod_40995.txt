Admission Date:  [**2147-3-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-3-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-6-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8388**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ultrasound-guided paracentesis [**2147-3-9**], [**2147-3-17**] and [**2147-3-23**] IR-guided Nasogastric Tube Advancement [**2147-3-10**]   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 79180**] is a 54F with PMH of HCV and EtoH cirrhosis (MELD = 16) decompensated with esophageal varices and ascites requiring weekly paracentesis, multiple prior SBOs, mesenteric ischemia s/p Ex-Lap/LOA [**10/2146**] p/w abdominal distension and severe pain.
In early [**Month (only) 958**] she was readmitted for abdominal pain and BRBPR.
Flex sig demonstrated rectal varices without stigmata of recent bleeding, and grade 1 interal hemorrhoids were noted.
Her abdominal pain ultimately improved w/ time again and she was advanced to a solid diet prior to discharge.
She was readmitted again several days later in [**Month (only) 958**] w/ similar symptoms and again NPO.
As discharge summaries from two most recent hospital stays have not been completed, it appears her symptoms improved with w/ bowel rest and she was subsequently discharged.
Per patient report, since discharge from [**Hospital1 18**], has had a 5d hospitalization at LGH for pain control of abdominal pain.
Patient reports that after discharge from LGH, abdominal pain worsened almost immediately.
She describes pain as diffuse throughout her entire abdomen, worse around right flank and mid-abdomen.
Only relief is through pain meds; eating and bowel movements do not affect [**Last Name (un) **] pain.
The stools are soft, light brown, and no blood.
She denies fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain.
Thus, malnutrition is most likely secondary to decreased GI absorption, possibly secondary to bowel edema.
In the ED, patient triggered for hypotension with initial VS HR100 SBP 87/69, which resolved without intervention.
She received 4mg of IV morphine for pain control.
A diagnostic paracentesis was attempted by no ultrasound windows were visualized.

RRR, S1 S2 clear and of good quality without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Minimal expiratory wheezes diffusely, slightly shallow breathing.
Dullness to percussion over dependent areas but tympanic anteriorly.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: Warm and well perfused, no clubbing or cyanosis.

[**2147-3-20**] Blood cultures x2: no growth [**2147-3-21**] Sputum gram stain and culture: [**9-28**] PMNs, no growth on culture [**2147-3-21**] Blood culture: no growth to date [**2147-3-21**] Urine culture: KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE 10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML   SENSITIVITIES AS ABOVE [**2147-3-23**] Peritoneal fluid gram stain and culture: no growth .
Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no definite vascular congestion.
There are areas of increased opacification at both bases.
Although this most likely reflects atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
[**2147-3-20**] PORTABLE ABDOMEN: There has been interval improved number of small bowel loops that are distended consistent with improved partial small bowel obstruction.
There is evidence of ascites .
[**2147-3-20**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There are low lung volumes.
There are unchanged multiple bilateral right greater than left calcified granulomas.
Left lowerlobe opacity is likely atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Overall, the patient tolerated the procedure well with no early complications.
[**2147-3-21**] PORTABLE ABDOMEN: Frontal abdominal chest radiograph demonstrates the NG tube terminates in the stomach.
[**2147-3-22**] ABDOMEN (SUPINE/ERECT): Supine and erect abdominal radiographs again demonstrate mild small bowel distention, worsened [**3-21**] at 4:41 p.m. Hernial orifices are not imaged.
There is no pneumoperitoneum.
Pulmonary and mediastinal calcifications are partially imaged.
IMPRESSION: Worsening small bowel distention.
Brief Hospital Course: 54yo F PMHx HCV and EtoH cirrhosis decompensated with esophageal varices and ascites requiring weekly paracentesis, multiple SBOs, mesenteric ischemia s/p Ex-Lap/LOA [**10/2146**] p/w abdominal distention and pain, found to have chronic partial small bowel obstruction, which was managed conservatively.
Hospital course was complicated by encephalopathy requiring intubation and MICU admission, as well as Klebsiella UTI and [**Last Name (un) **].
ACTIVE ISSUES: #CHRONIC ABDOMINAL PAIN/SBO: Patient had multiple prior admissions for chronic adbominal pain, thought to multifactorial due to chronic ascites, transient obstruction from adhesions/ileus, now presents with worsening of chronic pain.
Narcotic bowel syndrome was initially thought to be most likely diagnosis,  given patient's hx of narcotic abuse and dependence, now trying to taper off narcotics to be listed for transplant.
Chronic pain was consulted and recommended bupronorphine, which was not initially started out of concern for outpatient management of this drug.
While in the MICU, Transplant Surgery was consulted, and recommended conservative management of partial SBO with NGT, along with PO and PR lactulose.
Additionally, she had several therapeutic paracenteses for reflief of abdominal pressure from accumulating ascites.
Thereafter, she continued to have bowel movements and pass flatus.
At that time, there was no evidence of infection, as no SBP on paracentesis, no pneumonia on CXR, UA negative, and afebrile, no white count.
CT head on AM of [**3-19**] showed no acute intracranial process.
Patient was transferred to the MICU for concern of airway production as patient was becoming increasingly more confused in the context of being unable to take her lactulose and rifaxamin due to abdominal pain.
Cultures eventually returned with Klebsiella resistant to ceftriaxone.
# Klebsiella UTI: As noted above, in the context of encephalopathy, patient was noted to have Klebsiella UTI.
It is unknown whether her Klebsiella is sensitive to cefpodoxime, but the patient was willing to risk worsening of infection and possible sepsis/death by leaving the hospital.
# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine 1.7 on admission (baseline ranges from 0.8-1.1), which trended down to her baseline throughout admission.
Most likely, this was secondary to pre-renal azotemia from volume distribution with ascites, along with poor PO intake from SBO/abdominal pain.
Several albumin challenges over the course of admission resulted in improved kidney function.
CHRONIC ISSUES: #Unspecified Protein/Calorie Malnutrition: Pt w chronically poor nutrition [**1-5**] abdominal pain, albumin 3.1, many month period of poor PO intake/weight gain.
Patient was given dobhoff (could not be advanced post-pyloric at IR), and TF were initiated based on nutrition consult, but stopped when patient developed SBO.
# Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis with multiple complications.
She is on cipro at home for SBP prophylaxis.
She is not a transplant candidate at [**Hospital1 18**] due to continued narcotic-seeking behavior.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Patient is not a liver transplant candidate at [**Hospital1 18**] due to continued narcotic-seeking behavior.
# Given prescription for cefpodoxime for Klebsiella UTI, although bacteria may not be sensitive to this medication.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted with abdominal pain and found to have a partial small bowel obstruction.
While you were here, we performed two paracenteses on your ascites, and found that you did not have an infection of your peritoneal fluid either time.
We treated your obstruction with NGT to suction and keeping you with out food.
We tried to initiate tube feeding during this admission, but this was complicated by your small bowel obstruction, so we were unable to initiate tube feeding at this time.
We controlled your pain with tylenol, tramadol, gabapentin and flexeril, but you were not satisfied with this pain regimen.
You had a urinary tract infection, with a bacteria (Klebsiella) that was resistant to multiple antibiotics.
You understood that risks of stopping treatment included worsening of urinary tract infection, sepsis and death.
Please note that the following changes have been made to your medications: - START cefpodoxime 200 mg by mouth twice per day for seven days - START simethicone four times per day for abdominal pain  You left against medical advice, but understood the risks of leaving the hospital.
