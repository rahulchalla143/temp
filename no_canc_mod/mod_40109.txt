Approximately three weeks prior to presentation he noted chest pain during his treadmill exercises.
The patient characterized the pain as substernal pressure that originated in the center of his chest.
The nitroglycerin did not seem to help the patient's symptoms appreciably, but the pain would abate somewhat and he would then resume exercising.
The pain would disappear completely after about an hour and a half.
Because of these exercise related episodes of chest pressure, the patient saw his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
The echocardiogram portion of the examination was normal, however, during exercise 1 to 1.5 mm horizontal down sloping ST segment depressions were noted and isolated to leads V2 through V3.
Additionally, T wave inversions were noted at lead V2.
The rhythm was sinus with frequent atrial irritability noted throughout exercise.
No palpitations were reported and the patient remained hemodynamically stable.
The pain lasted approximately an hour and a half.
The pain occurred again on the morning of presentation while the patient was sitting, [**Location (un) 1131**] on line.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denied recent illness and injury (aside from his chronic fatigue syndromes).
The patient denied prior history of angina, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower extremity edema and claudication.
He also denies fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting, melena, hematochezia, dysuria or hematuria.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Stress echocardiogram ([**2156-3-3**]) ejection fraction 60% with no wall motion abnormalities or inducible echocardiogram ischemia, however, there were notable electrocardiogram changes as described above.
Symptom cluster deemed chronic fatigue syndrome.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General, awake, and in no acute distress.
Sclera anicteric.
No JVD or left anterior descending coronary artery.
No carotid bruits.
Normal S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No hepatosplenomegaly or pulsatile masses.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 60 beats per minute, old Q wave in lead 3.
There were no acute ST or T changes.
There were no changes versus prior study of [**2155-6-3**].
Chest x-ray no evidence of pleural effusions, infiltrates or congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service for further evaluation and treatment for his above noted conditions.
There was no significant obstructive disease in the LMCA.
There was no moderate disease in the left anterior descending coronary artery with 40% mid stenosis in the right coronary artery.
There was total occlusion of the distal left circumflex.
This event was complicated by bradycardia and hypotension as well as chest pain.
Aside from the above noted catheterization and interventions the patient was treated medically with aspirin, Plavix, beta blocker and an Ace inhibitor.
Free of chest pain and shortness of breath.
Coronary artery disease status post stent placement to obtuse marginal one and obtuse marginal two.
