CT Head: FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, minor or major vascular territorial infarct.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
The left ventricular functon is moderately depressed (LVEF ~30-35%) with global hypokinesis, inferior akinesis and inferobasal akinesis/dyskinesis.
Mild-moderate ([**2-4**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
An eccentric jet of mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) is seen directed toward the left atrial appendage.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation is seen.There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course:     Respiratory Failure: In the ER pH 7.18, CO2 98, with hypercarbic lethargy.
The suspected etiology of his respiratory failure was a chronic respiratory acidosis with superimposed acute metabolic acidosis from acute renal failure, causing decompensation and marked acidemia.
A swan-ganz catheter was placed and numbers were consistent with hypovolemia with a small element of heart failure.
Pt underwent fluid resuscitation and was placed on dopamine with good response and improvement in renal function, and Levaquin was started for possible sepsis/pulm infection.
Small bump in CK and Troponin postulated secondary to demand ischemia.
TEE done while intubated showed no change in cardiac function from previous TTE at OSH.
On hopital day 4, it was felt that he may be volume overloaded after fluid resuscitation in setting of CHF with elevated CVP, PAPD, and also was demonstrating low SVR likely due to sepsis.
Decreased UOP this day was thought to be due to low perfusion in setting of elevated preload and so he was placed back on renal dose dopamine and given lasix for diuresis until his numbers were consistent with euvolemia.
Pulmonary was consulted for episodes of hypercarbia during sleep, bipap was suggested but refused by patient.
The plan was to follow up with pulmonary as an outpatient with a formal sleep study.
Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had known atrial fibrillation but was NSR on admission, and had recently been started on sotalol.
He had an episode of atrial fibrillation with short reponse to 100J cardioversion, was started on amiodorone and then converted spontaneously.
