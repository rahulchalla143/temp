[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.2 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.4 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% to 45% (nl >=55%) Aorta - Ascending: *3.6 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm) Aorta - Descending Thoracic: *3.2 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm)  INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal anterior - hypo; mid anterior - hypo; basal anteroseptal - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo; basal anterolateral - hypo; mid anterolateral - hypo; anterior apex - hypo; lateral apex - hypo; apex - hypo; remaining LV segments contract normally.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Mildly dilated descending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Conclusions: Pre-CPB: The patient is in extremis, with IABP well-positioned, on high-dose inotropes, very low cardiac output.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There appears to be a rupture of the antero-lateral papillary muscle.
There is no pericardial effusion.
RV systolic fxn is preserved.
Mild improvement of anterior wall.
There is a well-seated and functioning mitral valve prosthesis.

Bilateral pleural effusions persist.
There is also bibasilar airspace density, likely atelectasis in the post-operative setting.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated bibasilar airspace opacity, likely atelectasis.
Continued on dopamine drip with IABP in cardiogenic shock and referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for urgent surgery after echo showed 4+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]/cabg x3 that evening and transferred to the CVICU in fair condition on titrated epinephrine, milrinone, and insulin drips.IABP removed.Extubated on POD #2 and transferred to the floor on POD #4 to begin increasing his activity level.Chest tubes and pacing wires removed without incident.
