Lung volumes are low, and there are bilateral small pleural effusions and atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral small effusions and atelectasis.
No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
[**2135-5-7**] Percutaneous nephrostomy: .
LENI ([**5-8**]): IMPRESSION: Short segment of non-occlusive thrombus within the left popliteal vein.
Echo ([**5-7**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %).
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No pneumothorax.
Bilateral low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectases and retrocardiac opacity.
[**2135-5-12**] Renal US: No evidence of hydronephrosis on ultrasound.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 80 yo man with h/o CAD, CHF, afib, h/o DVT on coumadin treated 1 week ago for UTI presents from OHS with recurrent dysuria and hematuria, found to have nephrolithiasis and UTI with sepsis.
# UTI with sepsis: Patient presented with pyelonephritis in the setting of nephrolithiasis complicated by sepsis given fever/bandemia, hypotension requiring pressors despite attempted volume resuscitation (total 4L NS).
Urology continued to follow with plans for lithotripsy of the renal stone after the 14 day antibiotic course.
Pain well controlled with acetaminophen.
Follow up with Urologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name **] on [**2135-5-25**] at 8am for pre-operative evaluation.
# Hypoxia: Patient with h/o COPD on 1L NC at home since a pneumonia a few months ago.
# Renal failure: Baseline Cr unknown.
Likely has acute renal failure in setting of pyelonephritis/nephrolithiasis as well as prerenal or ATN given hypotension on presentation.
# CHF: Patient became grossly volume overloaded during his ICU admission.
He appears only slightly volume overloaded on exam on day of discharge with significant chronic bilateral lower extremity edema.
An echo was performed showing left ventricular hypokinesis with EF of 40%.
No acute exacerbation on presentation, though he intermittently had hypoxia and dyspnea during his hospitalization.
Respiratory symptoms improved largely with diuresis and schedule nebs.
# H/o DVTs: Pt reports h/o multiple DVTs but none since coumadin initiation "a while ago."
INR was subtherapeutic on presentation in setting of being held for microscopic hematuria.
Due to decreased INR, leg edema and oxygen requirement, lower extremity ultrasounds were performed showing short segment of non-occlusive thrombus within the left popliteal vein.
# Chronic Afib: Pt with borderline RVR in setting of urosepsis.
# CAD: No evidences of ACS during admission.
# HTN: Patient was hypotensive on presentation.
# HL: Continued on atorvastatin 80mg daily .
# Disposition: Rehab .

Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after you were found to have a large obstructing kidney stone and a severe urinary tract infection.
The following changes were made to your home medications: 1) START Ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily for three days (last dose [**2135-5-20**]) to treat your urinary tract infection.
