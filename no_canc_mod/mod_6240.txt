The lungs are clear bilaterally, demonstrating no evidence of airspace consolidation, effusion, or CHF.
There is minimal subsegmental atelectasis at the left lung base, likely in the left lower lobe.
Again seen evidence of prior cardiac surgery.
There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion which may be in part due to the supine position and underinflation of the lungs but fluid overload or early failure would be a concern.
The degree of respiratory motion in the chest makes evaluation of the lower lung fields suboptimal however there is a patchy increase in lung markings at both bases.
IMPRESSION: Findings are likely a combination of the underinflation, supine position and some fluid overload.
Recommend a repeat examination when the patient condition permits to exclude developing airspace disease at both bases.
No intraluminal thrombus was identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.
<br> CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2141-10-1**] 5:50 PM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-30**] and earlier on [**10-1**] symmetrical opacification in the lower lungs has developed over the past two days, due in part to small increasing bilateral pleural effusion.
This could be either dependent edema or aspiration, more likely the former given some slight increase in mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.
No pneumothorax.
<br> Head CT [**9-29**]: EAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no comparison.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
There is generalized brain atrophy with slightly prominent ventricles, with periventricular white matter hypodensity densities, likely due to prior chronic small vessel ischemia.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinus.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Chronic small vessel ischemia.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
<br> CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2141-10-4**] 9:28 AM IMPRESSION: Resolution of pulmonary vascular congestion.
Pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis persist.
<br> <b>Discharge Labs:</b> WBC-7.7, Hct-38, Plt-277 Na-142, K-3.3, Cl-101, HCO3-34, BUN-20, Cr-1.3, Gluc-106, Ca-9.1, Mg-2.7, Phos-2.8, Alb-3.3  Brief Hospital Course: 1) RLE Cellulitis Initially treated with Vanc/Ceftaz for cellulitis.
Over the course of hospitalization, cellulitis improved and on discharge there was only minimal area of erythema.
<br> 2) Hypotension On arrival to the floor, pt was hypotensive w/ SBPs in 80s.
<br> 3) CHF, diastolic, acute on chronic/Acute Renal Failure After patient was transferred to the floor, his O2 sat was decreased (92% on RA) and he had significant secretions.
Clinical exam and CXR were consistent with volume overload and pulmonary congestion.
4) Pneumonia, question aspiration After transfer to the floor on [**10-1**], patient had fever of 103, thick secretions, and CXR that raised question of aspiration pneumonia.
He was continued on these for a few days until he remained afebrile with improved respiratory status.
He was evaluted by speech and swallow and was cleared for a regular diet due to no evidence of aspiration on bedside evaluation.
Consider Scopolamine patch if patient continues to have significant secretions.
<br> 5) MS changes Likely due to fever (source most likely RLE cellulitis).
Also had hypoglycemia (FS of 58).
During the initial part of his hospitalization his mental status fluctuated from being agitated (requiring restraints and sitter) to being lethargic and minimally responsive.
Once he was treated for infection, his mental status improved and returned back to baseline.
<br> 7) CAD No active issues.
