Admission Date:  [**2119-5-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2119-5-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2058-6-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 47645**] was a 60-year-old gentleman who presented to [**Hospital6 3872**] on [**2119-5-8**] with complaints of shortness of breath lasting approximately a few hours prior to arrival.
He had a productive cough as well with no fever.
The patient had been previously healthy with no known cardiac disease however upon interrogation at [**Hospital6 3874**] it was discovered that he had been having chest pain for a number of days intermittently prior to admission to the hospital.
The morning of admission he awoke with significant shortness of breath, chest pain and diaphoresis.
He had ST elevations in the inferior leads as well as ST depression in his anterior leads of his EKG.
Chest x-ray at that time revealed marked pulmonary edema.
His blood pressure was 80/50 in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 110 per minute.
The patient ruled in by cardiac enzymes as well as EKG for an inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular involvement.
The patient also had hemoptysis upon admission to the Emergency Department.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the cardiac catheterization laboratory the patient was found to have significant three-vessel coronary artery disease as well as 4+ severe mitral regurgitation with a left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 75%.
He was hemodynamically unstable and in cardiogenic shock with severe mitral regurgitation.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed emergently and the patient was also emergently taken to the operating room for mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting.
The patient was emergently intubated in the cardiac catheterization laboratory for oxygen saturation of about 60% with pulmonary edema which was treated with Lasix, 100% oxygen and PEEP.
Postoperatively the patient was in profound hypoxic state and pulmonary edema on epinephrine, Neo-Synephrine, vasopressin and Levophed IV drips, with an intra-aortic balloon pump in place.
He remained profoundly fluid overloaded.
Later in the day on [**2119-5-9**] the patient was begun on CVVH due to massive fluid overload with attempt to remove large volume of fluid in the hope that the patient would be able to be weaned from the ECMO circuit and be able to oxygenate adequately.
The patient remained on full support throughout the course of that night and on the morning of [**2119-5-10**], remained on full ventilator support, full ECMO support with CVVH for fluid removal.
From the catheterization laboratory the patient was transported again to the cardiac surgery recovery unit in critical condition, remained on the previously mentioned vasoactive drips and it was noted that the patient had an ischemic left leg which is the leg that his ECMO cannulas had been placed into.
He also had worsening metabolic acidosis treated with multiple amps of sodium bicarbonate throughout the course of the night.
He was noted to have a severely distended abdomen which worsened overnight as well as large volumes of guaiac positive watery stool being expelled.
In the early morning of [**2119-5-11**] a discussion took place with the patient's son and daughter-in-law who stated that they felt the patient would not want any further surgical procedures.
They also stated that the patient would not want to continue on the present amount of support that he remained on at this time due to his worsening condition.
