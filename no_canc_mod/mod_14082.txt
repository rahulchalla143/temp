She has been taking large amounts of [**First Name3 (LF) 10964**] (3.5-5gm/day) for the last two years to help alleviate her chronic abdominal pain and flank pain from pyelonephritis.
Six days prior to admission at [**Hospital1 18**], after spending two weeks at the OSH, she returned home with the diagnosis of viral enteritis.
Upon returning home, she developed severe right upper quadrant pain at rest that was rated a [**11-22**].
The pain was of similar quality to her previous pain at the OSH, constant, sharp, non-radiating, and increasing with palpation.
She experienced N/V (no blood) and a decreased appetite, but denied any shortness of breath, chest pain, bright red blood per rectum, or melena.
To alleviate her abdominal pain, she increased her pain medication to 10 tabs of [**Month/Year (2) 10964**] (5 gm/day) and Percocet 2 tabs q3hr (16tab x .325 = 5.2gm).
She was noted to be lethargic with slurred speech.
A nasogastric tube was placed, which yielded heme positive coffee grounds followed by bilious material.
A KUB showed increased stool without obstruction.
Her abdominal pain was treated with dilaudid 0.5 mg IV.
In the MICU, acetylcysteine was continued at @ 3.2 gm q4h IV, ativan was continued at 1mg IV q4hours for nausea, and dilaudid was given 0.5mg IV q3hours for abdominal pain.
After 24 hours of observation in the MICU, she was transferred to medicine.
At the time of the interview, the patient complained of RUQ and RLQ pain [**11-22**] which was dulled to an [**9-22**] with dilaudid.
In addition, she reported left flank pain that developed one day prior to admission.

Patient reported that large quantities of [**Month/Year (2) 10964**] were taken for pain control, with no intent of hurting self.
?s last ingestion, and given her chronic use of [**Month/Year (2) 10964**] and recent increase in acetominophen intake, the obtained concentration is may not represent her peak concentration.
PT/INR/PTT were measured q6h with no evidence of coagulopathy.
There were no signs of hepatic encephalopathy - no changes in MS no signs of asterixes during admission.
UTI/Pyelonephritis: Pt with h/o recurrent UTIs likely [**3-17**] neurogenic bladder.
Patient developed a severe [**11-22**] L flank on day 1 of hospitalization, which increased with palpation and did not radiate.
?s history of chronic pyelonephritis, self-catherization, and clinical findings, this is most likely pyelonephritis.
Urine culture + for E.coli and Enterococcus.
Colitis/diffuse abdominal pain.
Pt has chronic abd pain and [**Month (only) **] peristalsis, thought to be [**3-17**] autonomic dysfunction.
Given abd pain and large amount of drainage suctioned on arrival, she had KUB/CT scan r/o obstrcution.
KUB/CT from [**3-31**] without evidence of obstruction.
However, given interval increase in pain of RUQ and RLQ repeat abd CT was done on [**4-3**] with evidence of development of colonic wall thickening, involving the transverse colon, splenic flexure, and descending colon, findings that are consistent with colitis.
Stool culture + for c. diff.
Follow up CT on [**4-11**] with diffuse mesenteric and subcutaneous edema.
Unremarkable appearance of small bowel and colon on this examination with no wall thickening and apparent resolution of colitis.
Pt continued to have abd pain during admission which was managed to her satisfaction with dilaudid.
KUB significant only for small dilated loop of bowel in small int which is attributed to her chronic poor gut motility/peristalsis.
Anemia and upper GI bleed.
NG lavage at OSH showed coffee ground particles and LBM tonight consisted of a scant amt of dark red blood.
Given [**Month/Day (2) **] o/d, differential for Upper GI bleed at that time included gastritis, esophagitis, [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear (from vomiting), PUD, Dieulafoy?????
This was most likely secondary from hepatic dysfunction -> decrease in glucose production in setting of [**Month/Year (2) **] overdose.
Pt has had nausea for many years, but much increased during this admisison.
Likely multifactorial including decrease gastric mobility from MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10964**] overdose vs pyelonephritis.
Has tried multiple antiemetics but has found that most relieving regimen is phenergan with ativan prn.
Patient reports 81b weight loss over last 2 years, attributed to decreased appetite s/p pituitary resection.
Also concerning for neoplasm or eating disorders ??????
anorexia or bulemia.
She has tolerated custards and italian ice and jello and is slowly starting to tolerate soups.
Likely multifactorial including her h/o autonomic dysfunction vs [**Month (only) **] fluid volume from [**Month (only) **] PO intake/HGT suction vs SE of pain meds.
Ipratropium Bromide 18 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
