decreased responsiveness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 78yo woman with PMH significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, LVH with outflow tract obstruction, mental retardation, who presents with coughing and decreased responsiveness.
She then became "confused" and had decreased responsiveness.
She was having difficulty swallowing.
In the ED, prior to neurology arrival, the patient was intubated for airway protection as she was vomiting and unable to clear her secretions.
Her propranolol and lisinopril were changed to atenolol and verapamil due to her LVH with outflow tract obstruction.
Past Medical History: hypertension hyperlipidemia left ventricular hypertrophy with outflow tract obstruction mental retardation cerebellar degeneration tremor sensorineural hearing loss osteoporosis arthritis dry skin anxiety   Social History: registered with DMR.
Physical Exam: PE: VS: T 101.2, HR 78, BP 225/99, RR 19, SaO2 100%/vent Genl: intubated, sedated CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no m/r/g Chest: crackles bilaterally Abd: soft, NTND, BS+ Ext: warm and dry  Neurologic examination: Mental status: sedated, but not following commands by report prior to sedation; does not open eyes to noxious when off sedation.
R pupil 4, L pupil 2, nonreactive bilaterally.
Absent L corneal reflex.
Motor: moves right arm and leg purposefully, moves left arm and leg to noxious Sensory: withdraws to noxious in all extremities DTRs: hyperreflexic on the left (R/L tri [**3-12**], br [**2-9**], pat tr/2+, ach tr/2); toes upgoing bilaterally   Pertinent Results: [**2173-8-11**] 08:58AM BLOOD WBC-14.6*# RBC-4.06* Hgb-11.7* Hct-33.6* MCV-83 MCH-28.7 MCHC-34.8 RDW-15.9* Plt Ct-230 [**2173-8-11**] 08:58AM BLOOD Neuts-85.8* Bands-0 Lymphs-11.1* Monos-2.5 Eos-0.2 Baso-0.4 [**2173-8-11**] 08:58AM BLOOD PT-13.5* PTT-22.9 INR(PT)-1.2* [**2173-8-11**] 08:58AM BLOOD Glucose-164* UreaN-18 Creat-0.9 Na-140 K-3.8 Cl-105 HCO3-20* AnGap-19 [**2173-8-11**] 08:58AM BLOOD ALT-29 AST-35 LD(LDH)-424* CK(CPK)-119 AlkPhos-35* Amylase-22 TotBili-1.0 [**2173-8-11**] 08:58AM BLOOD cTropnT-<0.01 [**2173-8-11**] 05:00PM BLOOD CK-MB-5 cTropnT-<0.01 [**2173-8-11**] 08:58AM BLOOD Albumin-4.4 Calcium-8.7 Phos-3.0 Mg-2.2 [**2173-8-11**] 08:58AM BLOOD ASA-NEG Ethanol-NEG Acetmnp-NEG Bnzodzp-NEG Barbitr-NEG Tricycl-NEG  [**2173-8-11**] CT Head: FINDINGS: There is a large area of hypodensity in the right middle cerebral artery territory with extensive high-density material within this area consistent with acute hemorrhage.
In addition there is effacement of the basal cisterns due to transtentorial downward herniation.
A small area of sclerosis in the right frontal bone is nonspecific.
IMPRESSION: Large right MCA infarct with hemorrhagic transformation causing both transtentorial as well as subfalcine herniation.
FINDINGS: Again noted is a large area of hypodensity within the right MCA territory, with extensive high-density material within it, consistent with hemorrhagic transformation within an infarct.
There is again seen a leftward subfalcine herniation which appears to have slightly increased in extent since the prior study, now roughly 14 mm.
There has been an increase in the size of the left lateral ventricle, particularly the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] since the prior study.
There has been further sulcal effacement.
IMPRESSION: Increase in the subfalcine herniation, and increased dilation of the contralateral ventricle, with unchanged downward transtentorial herniation due to a large hemorrhagic right middle cerebral artery infarct.
Physical exam revealed a comatose woman, with a dilated fixed right pupil and right gaze deviation.
At 2100, the houseofficer examined the patient and found the exam remarkable for pupils fixed and dilated bilaterally, absence of corneal reflexes bilaterally, and positive dolls eyes maneuver(eyes stayed fixed with rotation of head).
There was lack of purposeful movements, and lack of movement in response to painful stimuli.
Cardiac exam was remarkable for absence of heart sounds, absence of carotid or radial pulses.
Lung exam was remarkable for absence of breath sounds, absence of respiratory effort, absence of inhalation and exhalation.
The patient was pronounced dead of intracerebral hemmorrhage by the houseofficer at 2115 on [**2173-8-11**].
