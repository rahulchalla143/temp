Admission Date:  [**2103-1-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-1-29**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**] Chief Complaint: Fall with head injury  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is a 87 year old man with history of orthostatic hypotension who is status post witnessed fall from standing with 5-7 minutes of unresponsiveness per the report of the family following the event.
The patient initially was brought to [**Hospital6 18075**] by EMS at which time he has a CT which was consistent with Subarachnoid/subdural hematoma and skull fracture.
He denies headache,weakness, numbness, tingling sensation, hearing or vision deficit.
Past Medical History: CABG postural hypotension hypercholesterolemia arteriosclerosis  Social History: He is retired from the fire department.
Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: O: T:96.2  BP: 122/69  HR:69    R:18   O2Sats:97% Gen: comfortable HEENT:small amount of red blood in oral pharynx.
NO battle sign/NO raccoon sign/No otorrhea/No rhinorrhea/No head laceration Pupils: 3-2mm bilaterally        EOMs:intact Neck: Supple.
No dysarthria.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Imaging: Head CT: FINDINGS: There are bilateral acute subdural and subarachnoid hematoma primarily along the frontoparietal lobes, which is unchanged in extent compared to the previous examination from [**Hospital3 **].
Given the pattern of hyperdense blood along the anterior cranial fossa, a component of parenchymal henmorrhagic contusion cannot be excluded.
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent, likely representative of age-related atrophy.
There is mild bihemispheric white matter hypoattenuation consistent with sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease.
The visible paranasal sinuses show high-density fluid in the left frontal sinus.
Leading into the left frontal sinus is a midline fracture of the frontal bone extending to the vertex.
Stable bilateral frontoparietal subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage with possible bifrontal contusions.
Fracture of the frontal bone in the midline may extend into the frontal sinus and places the patient at risk for a CSF leak.
Brief Hospital Course: 87yo male with past medical history significant for orthostatic hypotension s/p fall with bilateral frontal contusions SAD/SDH and skull fracture being transferred to the MICU with seizure-like activity, minimally responsive, profuse diarrhea, febrile, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.
# Altered Mental Status: Felt to be multifactorial due to worsening hypernatremia, underlying seizure disorder, head bleeds, and possible viral infection (suspected norovirus given profuse diarrhea).
Serial head CTs showed the subdural bleeds were stable.
Though there was concern for ongoing status epilepticus, he was monitored on continuous EEG without evidence of seizures, just generalized slowing.
Per neurology, patient was felt to loss of brainstem reflexes felt to be related to trauma.
# Code Staus: Transitioned from Full code to CMO given poor neurologic prognosis.
