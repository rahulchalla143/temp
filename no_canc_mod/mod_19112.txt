She reports that on wednesday morning, after a discussion over the phone, she felt a sharp pain over the mid chest.
Her pain never went away completely, it became a dull chest pain.
This morning, her pain increased in intensity and she felt that she had to go to the Emergency department.
She is able to walk a flight of stairs or walk around with no chest pain.
She was found with st elevation in v1-v5 with q waves on v1-v3.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Past Medical History: Hyperlipidemia Hypothyroidism s/p appendectomy  Social History: Smoking [**6-12**] cigg a day for the last 30 years.
Family History: No family history of premature CAD, or sudden death .
Sclera anicteric.
RRR s1-s2 normal, no murmurs appreciated Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Lungs: + crackles bilaterally Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
EKG OSH: Hr 100, normal axis, NSR, st elevation v1, v2, v3, v4., t wave inversion avl.
Selective coronary angiography showed a left dominant system with apatent LMCA.
LAD had a proximal thrombotic 90% lesion and some mild diffuse disease throughout.
RCA was small and non-dominnat and had a 50% ostial stenosis.
Hemodynamic assessment showed elevated right and left sided filling pressures and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0 X 23 mm Vision bare metal stent with no residual stenosis (see PTCA comments for detail).
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the distal half of the anterior wall and septum,, distal inferior wall and apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is a small pericardial effusion around the right atrium (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (proximal/mid LAD distribution).
Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system demonstrated no significant coronary artery disease.
The left circumflex demonstrated no angiographically flow limiting lesions.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 22 mm Hg.
There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback from the LV to the aorta.
58 y/o F with h/o hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism who presents with chest pain, STEMI now s/p LAD bare metal stent.
# STEMI - The patient was taken to the cath lab on arrival where initial angiography reveleaved a thrombotic proximal 90% lesion of the LAD.
She was continued on integrillin X36 hours post cath for persistent chest pain.
On [**2164-2-21**] the patient developed recurrent chest pain with question of ST changes and was taken back to the cath lab.
Angiography revealed a widely patent LAD stent.
TTE revealed  moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/near akinesis of the distal half of the anterior wall and septum,, distal inferior wall and apex.
She was started on anticoagulation for her depressed EF and akinetic wall.
Cardiac MR revealed a LV thrombus and the patient was discharged home on a Lovenox bridge and coumadin.
# Pericarditis - The patient developed chest pain consistent with post-MI pericarditis.
She was treated with ibuprofen and has resolution of her pain prior to discharge.
Cardiac MR was performed to evaluate the pericardium and on prelim read there was no evidence of pericarditis but concern for LV thrombus.
Disp:*14 syringes* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Anterior Myocardial infarction   Discharge Condition: Good, chest pain free, vital signs stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of a heart attack.
You were noted to have a clot in a chamber of your heart (ventricle) and you were started on blood thinning medication (coumadin).
You are taking the medications aspirin and Plavix to prevent a clot formation in your coronary artery stent.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if  you develop any worrisome symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, bleeding.
