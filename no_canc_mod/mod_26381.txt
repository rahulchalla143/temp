The findings were discussed with the referring physician in person at the completion of the study, and was also flagged to ED dashboard   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was seen in the emergency room and was brought emergently to the operating room for fixation of her open tibia/fibula fracture as well as closure of her facial lacerations.
A plain film was done that showed a distal radius fracture.
Her hospital course was otherwise without incident.
