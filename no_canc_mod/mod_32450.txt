Was found to have STE in inferior leads, troponin elevated at 13.
Cath revealed LAD with mod diffuse disease with serial 80% lesions proximally, LCx with mid-segment 70% hazy lesion, and RCA being occluded proximally with distal flow from L-R collaterals.
Patient complained of chest pain after cath and was transferred to the CCU for monitoring.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course: 66-year-old man with history of CAD (MI in [**2133**]), HTN, HL who presented to OSH with [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization.
# CORONARIES: Patient was found to have a STEMI with CK 385 on admission.
He also had 18 hours of eptifibatide.
His pain improved, and the nitro drip was weaned.
He did have ongoing left shoulder pain that was similar to his chronic pain, but cardiac enzymes trended down after the cath and there was low suspicion for recurrent ischemia.
Echo showed inferior and septal hypokinesis, but LVEF 60%, so no ACEI was indicated.
