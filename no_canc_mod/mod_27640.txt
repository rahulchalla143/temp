The mother's medical history was complicated by pneumonia requiring initiation of steroids.
She developed gestational diabetes most likely secondary to the steroid taper.
She was also a smoker and has an anxiety disorder.
She was monitored closely for the known intrauterine growth restriction and was noted to have absent diastolic flow on the day of delivery.
She was taken to cesarean section for nonreasurring fetal heart rate tracing.
There was large amount of blood noted at the time of delivery.
The infant emerged apneic and required positive pressure ventilation and blow-by O2.
Anthropometric measurements at the time of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit: Weight 1.135 kilograms, less than the 10th percentile, length 37 cm 25th percentile, head circumference 24.6 cm, less than 10th percentile.
His respiratory distress     resolved and he weaned to room air by day of life #1.
He has had rare episodes     of spontaneous apnea and bradycardia that have been     monitored and with no further treatment provided.
Fluids, electrolytes, nutrition: This infant had initial     hypoglycemia requiring treatment with 20% glucose and     water.
Infectious disease: Due to his respiratory distress and     presentation at the time of birth and the unknown group     beta strep status of his mother, this infant was     evaluated for sepsis upon admission to the neonatal     intensive care unit.
Gastrointestinal: This infant required treatment for     unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
Most recent rebound bilirubin on     [**2167-11-20**] was 1.6/0.5 mg per deciliter.
Neurology: A head ultrasound was performed on day of     life #5 and showed a left germinal matrix hemorrhage.
Repeat head ultrasound on [**2167-11-25**] showed the     previously mentioned left germinal matrix hemorrhage but     stable and no increased ventricular size.
Ophthalmology: This infant will require screening eye     exams for retinopathy of prematurity starting at     corrected age 33-34 weeks.
Psychosocial: This mother was very ill postoperatively     from her cesarean section.
There has been no notification of     abnormal results to date.
Immunizations recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis     should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for     infants who meet any of the following four criteria:     1) Born at less than 32 weeks;     2) Born between 32 and 35 weeks with two of the following:        Daycare during RSV season, a smoker in the household,        neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or school        age siblings;     3) Chronic lung disease     4)Hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease  Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall for all infants once they reach 6 months of age.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out of home caregivers.
Intrauterine growth restriction.
Transitional respiratory distress.
Suspicion for sepsis ruled out.
Apnea of prematurity.
