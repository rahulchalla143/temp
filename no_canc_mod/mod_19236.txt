Discharge Exam: Pulsus: 8mmHg VS: T 98 BP 120-130/60-70 HR 70s RR 18 O2 Sat 96% RA GEN: NAD, comforatble HEENT: EOMI, NCAT NECK: Supple, thyroid non-tender, JVP 6cm above the RA CV: RRR, normal S1/S2, no S3/S4, no murmurs, gallops or rubs PULM: CTAB, no incrased WOB ABD: NTND, NABS EXT: WWP, no c/c/e NEURO: A/Ox3, CN II-XII intact.
CXR ([**2156-10-29**]): The lungs are clear bilaterally with no areas of focal consolidation.
Small nodular densities overlying the left fifth rib are again noted most consistent with bone islands as seen on the prior chest radiographs with obliques.
There are no areas of focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly, which is new since [**2155-1-27**] study.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Moderate-sized pericardial effusion with faint enhancement of the pericardium.
No pulmonary embolism.
Moderate centrilobular emphysema.
Multiple small pulmonary nodules measuring up to 3 mm.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion posteriorly (1.9cm) and small anterior effusion (0.9cm).
No right atrial diastolic collapse is seen.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
After pericardiocentesis there is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Trivial residual pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is a very small anterior pericardial effusion.
There is a larger focal pericardial vs. pleurial effusion posteriorly.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small residual pericardial effusion.
There is an echolucent space near the left atrium that is probably a small pleural effusion.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
IMPRESSION: Very small partiall echo filled pericardial effusion with abnormal septal motion.
No hemodynamic compromise, but the abnormal septal motion raises the possibility of early constriction.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-10-31**], the findings are similar (PA hypertension is now identified).
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Pericardial Fluid Cell Block ([**2156-10-30**]): Rare atypical cells, cannot exclude reactive mesothelial cells.
Brief Hospital Course: Priamry Reason for Admission: 64 M with h/o HTN, HL, CAD, MI s/p DES presents with pericardial effusion of unknown etiology.
Active Problems: .
# Pericardial Effusion: In the ED bedside TTE was negative for tamponade physiology.
At this point the pt was bolused 500cc NS and repeat TTE showed moderate pericardial effusion with brief RA diastolic collapse.
Given the pt's deteriorating VS, elective pericardiocentesis was performed and 270 cc of serosanguinous pericardial fluid was removed.
Repeat ECHO after drain placement showed no significant reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.
The patient's drain was pulled on [**2156-10-31**] and serial echos were obtained that showed small residual echodense effusion with mild restrictive physiology.
He was started on colchicine and ibuprofen for anti inflammatory effects with symptomatic improvement.
TRANSITONAL ISSUES: The cause of his effusion is unclear at this time and ongoing outpatient workup should be conducted to r/o malignancy or other treatable cause.
# Atrial Fibrilation: On admission pt was noted to be in a-fib.
He has no known h/o a-fib, and it was felt his abnormal rhythm was [**1-28**] periacrdial effusion.
# Hypertension: While in the CCU, his antihypertensive medications were initially held except for his Carvedilol because of hypotension.
Chronic Problems: .
# Weight loss - patient reports 20lb weight loss over last few months.
Has been evaluated by GI as outpatient because of guaiac positive stool.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Pt should have ongoing outpatient workup for malignancy given weight loss and exudative pericardial effusion of unknown etiology .
# HTN - We continued his amlodipine, carvedilol and lisinporil and d/c'ed his hydralazine.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Lung nodules seen on chest CT. On TTE, there was possible areas calcfications in liver; will likely need outpatient RUQ u/s to further evaluate.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Priamry: Cardiac Tamponade Secondary: CAD s/p MI with DES ([**2152**]) HL HTN Anemia h/o CVA ([**2144**])   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because you were having shortness of breath and chest pain due to fluid around your heart.
