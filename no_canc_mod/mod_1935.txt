Admission Date:  [**2143-2-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-2-26**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lisinopril / Atenolol / Hydrochlorothiazide / Nsaids / Nifedipine Er  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Syncope .
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pacemaker placement EEG   History of Present Illness: Patient is an 89 y/o F w/ PMH of hypothyroidism, RLS who presents with 2 episodes of syncope in the last 24 hrs.
There was no witnessed seizure activity, no incontinence, no acute focal neuro sx, and no headache.
She denies any history of syncope, however she reports that over the last year she has felt intermittantly "unsteady" on her feet, however she denies recent falls, vertigo, pre-syncope, palpitations or lightheadedness.
On arrival to the floor the patient was being interviewed and stated "it's happening again" and was noted by the housestaff to become unresponsive for a brief moment.
Telemetry revealed bradycardia with HR in 20s for a few seconds.
However, has never had Holter monitor or echocardiogram.
CT head and CXR w/o acute change.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.
On last recorded visit in [**2141-6-23**], reportedly had "dizziness" thought to be secondary to orthostatic hypotension.
PSurgH: -Hernia repair [**2142-8-2**] -s/p surgical repair for spinal stenosis ~10 years ago -Laparascopic cholecystectomy ([**2139**]) -Carpal tunnel repair   Social History: Has never smoked, occasional alcohol (at most 1 glass of wine/week), denies IVDU, other drugs.
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
-cerebellar: No nystagmus, dysarthria, intention or action tremor -DTRs: 2+ biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar and 1+ ankle jerks bilaterally.
RADIOLOGY: CT Head ([**2-22**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Prior granulomatous exposure.
Extensive coronary artery calcifications.
EEG [**2143-2-25**]- IMPRESSION: This telemetry showed a normal background in wakefulness and in sleep there were no clearly epiltiform discharges.
Some sharp paroxysmal activity in the left central region appeared best correlated with the patient moving by video, thus most likely representing movement artifact with motion of left central and parietal EEG leads against the pillow.
Several different types of movement were associated with these EEG changes, they did not show definite spike and slow wave discharges.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 12409**] is an 89 F w/ PMHx of hypothyroid, prior syncopal episodes of unknown etiology presents w/ syncope and high degree AV block, now s/p temporary pacer placement.
#) Syncope:  Initially concern for cardiac arrythmia vs. neurologic.
This may suggest seizures with increased vagal outflow as an etiology, which fits clinically with the episodes of ?????
With bradycardia and AV block, initially patient had temporary pacemaker placed which was then replaced by permanent pacemaker.
There were no additional events on telemetry.
Neurology impression was that episode of syncope was all completely replated to cardiac arrythmia and apparently patient has had previous EEG which was also normal.
# CORONARIES:  No history of coronary disease.
Denies any history of chest pain.
ECG without ischemic changes and no change from prior.
No h/o CHF and no prior TTE.
On admission patient got echo which demonstrated mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No structural cardiac cause of syncope identified.
# RHYTHM:  Patient has history AV delay and now with documented high degree AV block on tele and multiple syncopal events.
Patient initially got temporary pacemaker and now is now s/p permanent pacemaker placement.
After temporary pacer placed, no addition events on telemetry.
# Hyponatremia - patient with Na of 130 this morning which improved prior to discharge to 134 with 500 cc normal saline bolus so likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
Of note, patient was noted to be hypertensive during pacemaker procedure to the 200s requiring hydral however subsequently was normotensive.
Secondary: Hypertension Dyslipidemia Hypothyroidism Spinal stenosis s/p surgical repair ~10 years ago Polymyalgia rheumatica (in remission) Osteoporosis Degenerative joint disease Left cataract extraction ERCP w/ sphincterotomy ([**2139**])  Discharge Condition: afebrile, vital signs stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with syncope and found to have complete AV block.
There were no changes made to your medications while you were in the hospital.
You should return to the Ed if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or abdominal discomfort.
Please call if you are unable to make any of these appointments.
