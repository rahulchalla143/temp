MICRO: [**2190-12-30**]  RPR: NON-REACTIVE [**2190-12-26**]  MRSA SCREEN: NEGATIVE [**2190-12-26**]  URINE CULTURE: NO GROWTH [**2190-12-26**]  BLOOD CULTURE-NO GROWTH [**2190-12-26**]  BLOOD CULTURE-NO GROWTH  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old male with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension who called EMS today as he was feeling weak for past two days likely due to hyperglycemia and volume depeletion from hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia in setting of stopping his oral diabetic medications.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia: Presented with serum glucose > 1000, arterial pH > 7.3, serum bicarb > 15 and minimal ketonuria.
Likely precipitant is stopping his oral diabetic medications due to poor outpatient follow-up, especially glipizide.
He did not have evidence of infection or ischemia.
The patient had multiple teaching sessions with nursing and [**Last Name (un) **] staff, in order to learn how to control his blood glucose appropriately.
On day of discharge [**Last Name (un) **] recommended restarting Metformin as part of his diabetic regimen.
# Acute kidney injury ([**Last Name (un) **]): Likely due to volume depeletion from above.
He was volume resuscitated as above.
# Osmolar gap: Likely due to lactic acidosis from hypovolemia in setting of above.
No history of ingestion of ethylene glycol or methanol.
No urinary ketone to suggest diabetic ketoacidosis.
# Dyspnea on exertion for past two weeks: Likely due to volume depletion in setting of above.
# Thrombocytopenia: Platelets dipped briefly to 121, but then stabilized in the 150s.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Question of psychiatric disorder per ED resident: Difficult to assess in setting of HONK, and in the acute setting of hospitalization.
Consider addressing as an outpatient with neurocognitive evaluation.
- Colonoscopy: Patient is due for screening colonoscopy.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Healthcare Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia .
Secondary diagnoses: Diabetes mellitus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
This is because you stopped taking your diabetes medications.
