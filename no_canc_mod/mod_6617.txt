CHEST, AP PORTABLE: There is a new endotracheal tube, beyond the thoracic inlet, terminating 4 cm above the carina.
There is new focal opacity in the left upper lobe, consistent with aspiration or pneumonia.
New focal opacity in the left upper lobe with rapid onset, with the differential diagnosis including aspiration or pneumonia.

The ill- defined pulmonary vasculature as well as basilar interstitial opacities are most consistent with stable vascular congestion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
Mild vascular congestion.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2167-4-22**] 11:58 AM CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Reason: infiltrates [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 59 year old man with r IJ REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: infiltrates PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, 12:08 P.M.
FINDINGS: Compared with 5/8 at 11:38 p.m., no significant change in tube and line positions.
No overt CHF.
There has been partial interval clearing of the streaky atelectasis/infiltrate in the retrocardiac region.
There has also been partial clearing of what appears to be atelectasis in the left peri/suprahilar region.
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2167-4-22**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-4-25**], no change.
RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2167-4-23**] 7:46 PM CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON- Reason: CTA CHEST ONLY; eval for PE infiltrates and pulmonary fibros Field of view: 36 Contrast: [**Hospital 13288**] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 59M s/p aborted kidney tx for hypoxia in OR REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: CTA CHEST ONLY; eval for PE infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
Assess for pulmonary embolism.
CTA OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There are no filling defects present within the main pulmonary arteries or the segmental branches to the upper lobes bilaterally.
There is biatrial enlargement.
There is no aortic dissection.
There is no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis.
There is a bilateral, dependent atelectasis.
There are mild, streaky opacities within the left lobe.
None meet criteria for pathology.
There are no pathologic hilar or axillary lymph nodes.
Bone windows demonstrate no lytic or blastic lesions.
There are mild degenerative changes of the mid to lower thoracic spine.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism within the main pulmonary arteries and segmental branches to the upper lobes of the lungs.
No pulmonary fibrosis.
Mild, streaky opacities present at the left lung base largely unchanged compared to the CT torso from [**2166-2-21**].
RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2167-4-26**] 12:04 PM US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN Reason: seroma/hematoma [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 59 year old man with aborted RLQ renal transplant now with cont drainage from wound despite stitches REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: seroma/hematoma LIMITED ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND INDICATION: 59-year-old man with aborted right lower quadrant renal transplant, presenting with drainage from the wound.
No abnormal fluid collection was identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fluid collection.
The operation was aborted intra-operatively due to unknown cause of hypoxia.
A chest xray a new focal opacity in the left upper lobe with rapid onset.
He remained afebrile and his oxygenation status remained good on 3 liters nasal cannula.
A CTA chest demonstrated no PEs.
On POD 3, he continued to remain afebrile and was tolerating a renal diet.
On POD 4, he continued to remain afebrile and toelrating a renal diet.
He remained stable on room air and continued to have bowel movements.
On POD 5, he remained afebrile and toelrating a renal die.
His wound continued to have serous drainage and 3-0 nylon stiches were placed to better approximate the skin edges.
He was tolerating a renal diet, afebrile, ambulating well, and continued to have bowel movements.
