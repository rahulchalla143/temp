He first noted symptoms on approximately the [**Hospital1 107**] Day weekend.
He described his symptoms as similar to asthmatic symptoms.
He used his friend's albuterol nebulizers with minimal improvement.
His shortness of breath at this point was severely limiting his activity, walking 20 to 30 feet with severe dyspnea.
He also describes decreased appetite.
At the beginning of [**Month (only) **] he saw his primary care physician who felt he was having an asthma exacerbation and gave him intravenous Solu-Medrol, and the patient relayed a vague story of going into sinus tachycardia with a heart rate in the 120s, a fingerstick in the 500s, been sent to the Emergency Department and admitted to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital.
A chest x-ray showed a question of a left upper lobe pneumonia.
An echocardiogram during that admission showed global hypokinesis, 4-chamber dilatation, an ejection fraction of 10% to 15%.
There were no previous echocardiograms.
The patient denies antecedent upper respiratory infection or recent diarrheal illness.
No joint pains.
Denies a history of exertional chest pain, previous orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.
In the week between discharge from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and admission to [**Hospital1 69**] he felt better with decreased dyspnea on exertion, increased exercise tolerance, and decreased lower extremity edema.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Global hypokinesis.
Elevated liver function tests.
FAMILY HISTORY:   One uncle with coronary artery disease and a sister with Grave's disease.
In general, he was a large man, in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat showed extraocular muscles were intact.
The oropharynx was clear without lesions, 10 cm of jugular venous distention in the neck.
Heart was fourth heart sound and first heart sound and second heart sound regular without murmurs.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Liver ultrasound from the outside hospital showed fatty infiltrate, no ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, normal portal flow.
Transthoracic echocardiogram at the outside hospital on [**7-6**] showed dilated left atrium of 5.6 cm, dilated left ventricle with severe global hypokinesis, ejection fraction of 10% to 15%, moderate mitral regurgitation, dilated right ventricle with moderate global dysfunction, mild tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary artery pressure in the 30s.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was noted to be in severe heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy based on the outside hospital records, the etiology of which was unclear.
He was sent to the catheterization laboratory which revealed a middle left anterior descending artery lesion of 80%, status post stent.
The left circumflex had a moderate ostial lesion which was not intervened upon.
