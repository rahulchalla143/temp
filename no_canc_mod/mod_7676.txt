Small left pleural effusion.
Low lung volumes.
There is anasarca, bilateral pleural effusions, and mild-to-moderate ascites within the abdomen.
Again appreciated is severe diffuse atherosclerosis involving the aorta and all branch vessels.
The native kidneys are severely atrophic and the right lower quadrant renal transplant appears unremarkable.
Sigmoid diverticulae.
There is mottled gas pattern in the sigmoid colon, favoured to represent air in diverticulae.
Pneumatosis is less likely.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 70-year-old man with a complicated medical history that includes ERSD with cadaveric renal transplant, coronary artery disease with multiple interventions, sCHF with ejection fraction of 20%, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, spinal stenosis, atrial fibrillation who recently underwent amputation of his second right toe, fifth right ray and debridement of right heel who is presenting with hypotension.
He had not been febrile or had a white count.
He has a recent intervention to his right foot that may be a possible site of infection, although his wounds currently do not have obvious visual evidence of infection.
His urinalysis has small leuks and few bacteria (but no pyuria).
SVO2 not suggestive of cardiogenic shock.
(The patient once had an anaphylactic reaction to penicillins.)
He then developed a wide complex bradyarrhythmia with poor perfusion and mottling of his appendages.
No additional pressor was added, and the patient expired in the early afternoon of [**2189-10-14**], likely secondary to a cardiac event caused by the strain of his likely sepsis.
