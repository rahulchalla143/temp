Over the course of the day he gradually became more short of breath and decided to come to the ED.
Pt denies any dietary indiscretion.
He also tries to watch his fluid intake but reports that he has more difficulty with this.
He was treated with a course of Biaxin with some improvement, but that he has had worsening cough and fatigue again since the end of that treatment.
He reports feeling extremely tired, especially since his Toprolol XL dose was increased to 200mg.
He does complain of abdominal discomfort in the epigastric area, but says this pain is not new for him.
He had a EGD and colonoscopy in the past which was normal according to the pt.
He also reports diarrhea but says that he has had diarrhea off and on for "a long time".
The diarrhea recently worsened, so he took Immodium with some relief.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt had CXR consistent with fluid overload.
He was also given calcium gluconate for his hyperkalemia.
He was sent for HD where he began to feel decreasing SOB.

There is bilateral hilar fullness in pulmonary vascular distribution and interstitial edema.
Consistent with Moderate/severe volume overload.
As the  patient has some subtle colonic thickening here, a tumor with microperforation is considered, although thought less likely.
ECHO [**2104-12-22**]:  EF  25-30%, new pan-wall motion abnormalities   Brief Hospital Course: # SOB: The pt's shortness of breath is most likely related to fluid overload since he developed the SOB after missing his scheduled HD.
On exam, the pt appeared to be working hard to breathe, crackles were heard in both lower lung fields and the pt had an elevated JVP and lower extremity edema.
The CXR was consistent with fluid overload.
There were a few expiratory wheezes bilaterally, indicating a component of reactive airway disease likely exacerbated by a respiratory tract indection.
The pt reported that he has had a cough productive of greenish-brown sputum since [**Holiday 1451**].
After dialysis the pt was only mildly short of breath.
# Afib with RVR: The pt has had several recent ER visits for paroxysmal Afib with RVR.
He did not complain of any CP, SOB, light headedness or dizziness.
The pt's low BP responded to IV fluids and was 100-110s/60-70s after the pt received 1.5L of fluid during the episode of RVR.
Pt had no further episodes of Afib.
The pt's EKG after converting back to sinus rhythm showed no persisting evidence of infarction.
# Abdominal pain - On [**12-17**], after dialysis pt began to complain of crampy abdominal pain.
He had 3 normal bowel movements and then developed non-bloody diarrhea.
The pt's pain became worse over the morning.
Pt was extremely tender in the right upper and lower quadrants.
His abdomen was soft, but he did have some voluntary guarding.
Pt was made NPO and had an upright AXR which showed no free air but was limited due to pt's body habitus.
Pt was evaluated by surgery who recommended a CT abdomen which showed mild stranding around the cecum and mild wall thickening????
Pt's history is concerning for ischemic bowel in the context of atrial fibrillation with possible clot vs hemoconcentration after hemodialysis with decreased flow.
The pt has a known hx of Afib, but he was not on Tele when the abdominal pain developed.Other possible causes were infectious causes, including gastroenteritis and C. difficile colitis.
Pt had no known sick contacts and had a very focal abdominal exam, and a high WBC, so gastroenteritis seemed unlikely.
Other possible causes included appendicitis, a right sided diverticulitis or another bowel abscess.
There was no evidence of any of these processes on CT. Surgical consultation was obtained.
The patient was not felt to have an acute abdomen on the evening of [**2104-12-18**] but was placed on intravenous antibiotics with a plan for serial exams.
The patient developed worsening abdominal pain a fever and was taken to the operating room [**Last Name (un) **] on [**2104-12-19**] for a right colectomy.
A focal area of necrosis was found in the ascending colon without gross fecal contamination.
He persisted with tachycardia and low-grade fever over the next 2 days.
Cardiology consultation was obtained and they did not feel that the patient was having myocardial ischemia/infarction.
# Lethargy - Pt was extremely lethargic on presentation.
Possible causes of pt's lethargy include a component of prolonged infection, the possible contribution of medications especially B Blocker and Gabapentin, and a contribution of pt's severe and untreated OSA.
No acute issues.
Pt was asymptomatic with this K. Pt received calcium gluconate in the ED.
