There is small quadrigeminal cistern this can be related to patient's young age or due to mild cerebral edema.
[**2133-12-5**] CT c-spine w/o contrast No fracture or subluxation in cervical spine.
Severe open-book deformity of the left hemipelvis with wide space symphyseal distraction and SI joint diastasis, associated with left common iliac artery disruption and distal nonperfusion of the left lower extremity.
No active extravasation.

Comminuted and displaced left distal femur fracture.
Mild pulmonary contusion, in combination with aspiration and atelectasis.
No solid organ injury.
Stable density along the tentorium and posterior cerebellum suggesting stable small subdural hematoma; this could relate to transverse dural sinus injury.
New round focus of hyperdensity in the left frontal lobe could represent evolving contusion, in a typical location, or relate to partial volume averaging.
New right frontal ICP bolt device with small pneumocephalus likely as a result of the procedure.
Diffuse effacement of the sulci suggestive of diffuse cerebral edema.
Previously visualized small density along the tentorium and posterior cerebellum suggesting small subdural hematoma.
Possible drusen- bilateral- correlate with opthalmologic examination.

GU: He was originally seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] [**2133-12-10**] with findings of left corpora cavernosum transection.
His urethra and corpus spongiosum appear viable/intact and bulbospongiosus muscle was reappoximated over urethra.
He also had scrotal edama ecchymosis and mottling without any evidence of necrosis or infection.
Integumentary: He underwent multiple surgical repairs and debridments and ultimately left hemipelvectomy.
