Past Medical History: PMHx (per outside records) obesity sleep apnea hypertension a-fib CHF hyperthyroidism/goiter   Social History: married w/ children, no smoking history, no etoh, no drugs  Family History: mother w/ early CAD   Physical Exam: PE: 97.7/ 79 in a-fib/ 151/70/ 19/ 100% vent: AC/ 100% FiO2/ 550/ 10 GEN: unresponsive, intubated, morbidly obese HEENT: pupils fixed and dilated unequal w/ L<R, no corneal reflex, goiter CV: a-fib, regular rate, no murmurs appreciated, good radial pulses, strong DP pulses bilaterally.
LAE, sclerotic AV leaflets ECG: A-fib, LVH, 1mm ST elevation II, aVF 1mm ST depression in V1/V2.
Repeat ECG: prolonged PR, bigeminy ST depression V1/V2, v4R w/ ?
Neuro- The patient was admitted to the CCU following resuscitation from a v-fib cardiac arrest, after being unresponsive for an undetermined amount of time.
At the time of admission, the patient was intubated with profound neurological deficits including an absent corneal reflex, absent pupillary reflex, absent gag reflex, no spontaneous movement in her extremities, and did not show any response to painful stimuli.
Neurology was consulted on the evening of admission, and the patient underwent a head CT which was negative for acute hemorrhage.
An EEG was performed the following day which showed bursts of theta/delta activity and suppressive bursts are all compatible with a post-anoxic encephalopathy of moderate degree.
There was no sustained seizure activity or clear epileptiform activity.
The patient underwent a repeat EEG a few days following admission, which showed no EEG rhythms seen, this tracing shows worsening compared to the prior EEG and is suggestive of a poor prognosis.
No focal,lateralizing, or epileptiform features were seen.
Anterior, septal and apical  hypokinesis to akinesis is present.
The patient was initially placed on afterload reduction, but was later discontinued on all blood pressure medications as she became hypotensive.
The patient was initially made DNR/DNI by her husband, but this was reversed and the patient was resuscitated again after an asystole cardiac arrest on the second day of admission.
The patient was monitored on telemetry and found to be persistently in atrial fibrillation, was subsequently loaded and started on IV amiodarone, resulting in effective rate control.
Pulmonary- The patient remained intubated throughout her hospitalization for respiratory failure thought to be secondary to cardiac arrest which resulted in ARDS versus aspiration pneumonia.
The patient was found to have a left-sided pneumothorax that resolved with chest tube placement.
After being intubated for over one week, the patient was evaluated by surgery for trach placement, which was thought to be likely difficult and associated with high risk.
Renal- the patient's creatinine at the time of admission was 2.1 and rose to 4.0, at which point the patient also became oliguric, likely secondary to ATN.
Endocrine- the patient had a history of hypothyroidism with a prominent goiter and insulin dependent diabetes.
The patient was placed on an insulin drip for tight blood glucose control.
In addition, she was monitored for pain with pain medications administered as needed.
A palliative care consult was placed and a family meeting was arranged which included social work and ethics in addition to the primary team and palliative care.
