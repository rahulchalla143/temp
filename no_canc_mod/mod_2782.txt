On the morning of admission, son noted that pt had increasing urinary frequency, which pt stated had been going on for [**2-13**] weeks.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p RCA and LAD stenting [**2186**].
- PVD - s/p R ICA stent ([**2186**]) with a stable moderate left internal carotid artery stenosis.
- CKD (baseline cre = 1.2-1.3) - DM2 - HTN - hyperlipidemia - GERD - h/o radiation to the larynx in the Soviet [**Hospital1 1281**] in the [**2153**] for presumed laryngeal cancer.
- h/o aspiration pneumonia.
- h/o gastrojejunostomy tube; status post aspiration pna (removed) x 1 [**1-12**] yrs to reduce need for oral feeds and prevent recurrent pneumonia.
The cause of the aspiration pneumonia was thought to be disordered swallowing s/p XRT to his larynx yrs ago in the USSR.

- h/o abnormal stress test in [**1-12**].
+CP and a positive stress test showing a moderate sized inferior wall reversible defect and was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who advised cardiac catheterization at that time.
- spinal stenosis - s/p ?
recent spinal injection.
- h/o recurrent bronchitis - with restrictive defect on PFTs [**6-16**].

PULM: coarse breath sounds at both bases and anteeriorly, no r/r/w.
ABD: soft, NT, ND, + BS, no HSM.
Multiple pulmonary nodules combined with reticular opacity.
Given the absence of this finding on the chest CT from [**Month (only) **] [**2189**], this might represent infectious process or non-infection lung inflammation.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.

# Hypoxia - The patient was brought to the ED because of hyperglycemia, without prior complaint of SOB per his son.
A left IJ was placed and he was started on levophed for hypotension (MAP 65).
He was felt to have a PNA and was switched to ceftriaxone because of concern over a prolonged QTc.
He was extubated on HD#3 without difficulty.
During his ICU course, he continued to have mild episodes of respiratory distress thought secondary to mucous plugging.
Given his history of aspiration PNA's, it was felt that the patient would benefit from a PEG, but the patient continuously declined.
He still required occasional oxygen by nasal cannula overnight due to periodic desaturations while supine.
# Hypotension - The patient was normotensive on admission to ED, but became hypotensive around the time of intubation.
SBPs improved with decreased sedation, the patient require pressors into HD#2 (initially on levaphed, which was switched to dopamine as it was felt it might be contributing to sinus bradycardia below) but he was then weaned off and maintained his pressures throughout the rest of his ICU course.
# Ischemia: In the ED, there was some initial concern for ACS given an elevated troponin to 0.07, but serial enzymes were negative.
The original enzyme leak was felt likely to demand ischemia from tachycardia and hypotension.
He was maintained on ASA/plavix but beta blocker was deferred given his history of bradycardia.
During his course in the ICU, the patient continued to complain of left sided chest pain and multiple sets of enzymes were negative and EKG's remained unchanged.
The patient reports that this pain has been ongoing for >1 month.
# Rythym: pt initially nsr, however he subsequently developed sinus bradycardia into 20-30s with accompanying drop in a-line SBPs (from 100s to 80s).
pt not on BB at baseline (apparently h/o sinus bradycardia and syncopal episode, followed by dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]).
EP consult was obtained given signficant drop in SBPs with bradycardia, who felt bradycardia due to acute illness/intubation.
The patient remained bradycardia after extubation to 50s, though SBPs stable.
His episodes of bradycardia were always asympotomatic and brief.
# ARF - baseline creatinine 1.2-1.3, up to 2.0 on admission, felt [**2-12**] dehydration from DKA, and rapidly improved with aggressive IVF hydration (total 11L given over initial 24 hrs).
# Hyperthyroid - given h/o neck radiation and bradycardia, TSH was obtained (0.087), which was felt suggestive of hyperthyroidism, though difficult to assess in the setting of acute illness.
T4, T3 uptake, and TBG were obtained, and breif curbside with endocrine suggestive that T3 uptake (more appropriate indicator in acute illness) and TSH both being low suggested TSH was likely abnormal because of acute illness.
#Guiac + Stool No gross melena or hematochezia, however found to have heme + stool.
#FEN Regarding the patient's diet, he understands that he is at chronic risk of aspiration given his laryngeal dysfunction.
The patient is at increased risk of aspiration with this diet, however without liberalizing his PO intake he is unlikely to sustain adequate PO's to prevent renal failure and otherwise decompensation.
In summary, the patient was admitted to the MICU with severe aspiration pneumonia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2670**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: aspiration pneumonia, streptococcus pneumonia Secondary: Diabetes milletus, coronary artery disease, HTN, presumed laryngeal cancer w/ chronic aspiration   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a severe lung infection caused by aspiration (inhalation of food and mouth secretions).
