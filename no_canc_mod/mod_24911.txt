Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Arterial line Placement Cardiac catheterization Tracheal Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation   History of Present Illness: the patient is an 89-year-old man with history of hypertension, aortic stenosis, CKD stage 2-3, and chronic obstructive asthma who presented to the ED via EMS from [**Hospital3 2558**] (a halfway house) with shortness of breath and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Per report, patient was in his usual state of health until 3:20am on the morning of admission, when he developed acute onset chest pain and said that he "could not breath."
In the ambulance en route to the hospital, patient became acutely dyspneic, with respiratory rate in the 40s and satting low 80s on non-rebreather.
Per report, patient was talking and moving all extremities; however, he was extremely dyspneic with respiratory rate in the 30s to 40s, fighting to breath, and satting in the low 80s on the non-rebreather.
Patient reportedly said that he wanted "everything done" and he was therefore intubated in the emergency room for hypoxemic respiratory failure and started on Fentanyl and Versed (proprofol was started initially but his blood pressures dropped).
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions, and a BNP was drawn that came back at [**Numeric Identifier **] (unfortunately there are no priors for comparison).
Past Medical History: --aortic stenosis --essential hypertension --unspecified monoarthritis --benign prostatic hyperplasia --chronic obstructive asthma --chronic renal insufficiency, stage 2-3 --hyperlipidemia **negative PPD in [**2132-7-16**]**   Social History: lives at [**Hospital3 2558**], a halfway house [**Location (un) 88162**].
systolic murmur appreciated Pulm: CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: soft, NT, +BS.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Micro Data- Urine Legionella Antigen- negative Blood cultures from [**11-11**] -pending Urine Culture [**11-11**]- No growth Sputum Culture- RARE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe ypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 35 %).
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**1-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction suggestive of CAD.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Severe diastolic dysfunction with markedly elevated left sided filling pressures with secondary pulmonary hypertension.
COPD and suspected pulmonary hypertension.
Mild cardiomegaly.
Dense left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
CHF with mild interstitial edema.
Probable small bilateral effusions.
Bilateral moderate effusions and associated atelectasis 2.
Possible right lung lower lobe pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary this is an 89-year-old man with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and aortic stenosis who presented with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath, intubated in the emergency [**Hospital1 **] for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Found to have NSTEMI and now s/p cardiac cath showing 3 vessel CAD.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Pt intubated in ED.
Pt found to have ACS with CHF on cardiac cath.
Wedge pressure of 25-30, suggesting pulmonary congestion which is consistent with elevated BNP and CXR showing pulmonary edema.
However with improving leukocytosis and no clinical evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics were discontinued.
# Hypertension: SBP to 160s-170's at times, however usually between 120-140?????
# Acute renal failure: Unclear baseline function.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent chronic failure.

Because of this you required a tube to help you breath for several days.
We discovered that you had a heart attack which contributed to your difficulty breathing.
