During prior hospitalization, patient was evaluated for hepatic decompensation with bilirubin rising from 1.1 to 10.1 over 2 months.
Of note, patient developed progressive thrombocytopenia while in the hospital with platelets falling from baseline of 148 on admission to 37 prior to discharge.
Shortly after discharge from hospital on [**9-1**] had nausea with nonbloody emesis x 5.
The next day, she continued to feel nausea with dry heaves accompanied by small amounts of bloody phlegm.
She also noted loose dark, tarry stools x 2.
She had slight dizziness with ambulation.
Denies any syncope, chest discomfort, or worsened dyspnea from baseline.
No confusion, abdominal discomfort, or other complaints.
Initial labs were remarkable for Hct at baseline of 26, platelets of 11,000 and worsening hyponatremia to 121 from baseline of 130s.

There is no evidence of pneumonia, CHF or aspiration.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Low inspiratory volumes.
Allowing for this, there is possible cardiomegaly and mild prominence of the upper zone vessels, without overt CHF.
Minimal patchy opacity at both bases likely reflects atelectasis.
No definite consolidation.
No pneumothorax detected.
CD45-bright, low side-scatter, lymphoid gated events are approximately 10% of total analyzed events.
CD19 and CD20 co-expressing B cells comprise approximately 18% of lymphoid-gated events, and do not express aberrant antigens (CD5 or CD10).
INTERPRETATION Cell marker analysis demonstrates a non-specific T-cell dominant lymphoid profile.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
EGD Report Findings: Esophagus: Mucosa: Mild esophagitis was noted.
Stomach: Mucosa: Patchy erythema and mosaic appearance of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the pylorus and whole stomach.
These findings are compatible with gastritis and portal hypertensive gastropathy.
No gastric or esophageal varices were seen.
Other findings: There was a slightly raised appearance of the pyloric tissue.
Erythema and mosaic appearance in the pylorus and whole stomach compatible with gastritis and portal hypertensive gastropathy.
No gastric or esophageal varices were seen.
There was a slightly raised appearance of the pyloric tissue.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 65 year old female with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b ascites who presented with thrombocytopenia, hematemesis, epistaxis, vaginal bleeding, melena, and BRBPR.
# Thrombocytopenia: Her thrombocytopenia may be due to liver disease, but the acute drop is more likely due to autoimmune causes, infection, or a medication effect.
# Hematemesis: The etiology of her initial hematemesis is unclear.
It may have been [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear versus vomiting from epistaxis draining down the posterior pharynx.
The patient's daughter reported that she had a recent EGD that was negative for varices, but documentation of this was not obtained during the MICU stay.
Her bleeding slowed considerably and she remained hemodynamically stable.
An EGD was performed on [**2120-9-10**] which showed only mild esophagitis and gastritis.
# Helicobacter pylori:  Her H pylori serology was found to be positive and her EGD showed patchy gastritis and gastropathy.
# Hyponatremia: She presented with Na of 121 from baseline of 130s with no signs of altered mental status.
# ESLD: Diagnostic paracentesis was negative for SBP.
She had significant ascites which is increasingly uncomfortable for her.
# Epistaxis: She continued to have epistaxis overnight after admission.
# Hypertension: Her BP remained stable in 130s-140s.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a low platelet count and bleeding from multiple parts of your body.
You were initially sent to the Intensive Care Unit, where you were given transfusions of blood, platelets, and clotting factors.
You received additional platelet transfusions and evaluation of your liver disease.
The bleeding stopped, and your blood counts also started increasing.
Several liters of fluid were removed.
The fluid was tested and showed no evidence of infection.
You also had an upper endoscopy (EGD) to check for possible sources of bleeding in your esophagus, stomach, and the first part of the small intestine.
The endoscopy showed some inflammation of the esophagus and stomach, but no major source of bleeding.
A blood test was also sent which showed possible infection with bacteria called Helicobacter pylori, which can lead to ulcers and inflammation in the stomach.
You were started on medications to treat this infection and eradicate the bacteria.
START: Furosemide 40 mg by mouth daily START: Spironolactone 100 mg by mouth daily START: Omeprazole 20 mg by mouth twice daily START: Metronidazole 500 mg by mouth twice daily for 14 days START: Clarithromycin 500 mg by mouth twice daily for 14 days START: Lorazepam  0.5 mg by mouth at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Do not drive or operate machinery while taking this medication since it can make you sleepy and slow your reaction times.
