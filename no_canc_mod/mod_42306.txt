Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization and placement of drug-eluting stent to RCA   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 54731**] is an 81yo M with history of HTN, questionable dyslipidemia and OSA, admitted to 6-CCU on [**2132-8-18**] via ED, w/ complaint of one hour episode of substernal chest pressure/tightness radiating up into the neck awaking him from sleep.
The pain was associated with diaphoresis but no shortness of breath.
His wife gave him a full aspirin and the pain went away.
She called EMS, and he was chest pain free upon available to the ER.
Initital EKG showed first degree AV block and ST elevations in the inferior leads.
In the cath lab, he had a subtotal ostium PL branch RCA lesion and DES was placed.
He developed increased respiratory distress with some coughing and questionable SVT with cough.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Hypertension, questionable dyslipidemia  2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: Evidence of prior inferior MI on EKG in [**2123**]  3.
No family history of cancer or diabetes.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB anteriorly, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
GENERAL: 81 yo M in no acute distress HEENT: PERRLA, no pharyngeal erythemia, mucous membs moist, no lymphadenopathy, JVP non elevated CHEST: CTABL no wheezes, no rales, no rhonchi CV: S1 S2 Normal in quality and intensity RRR no murmurs rubs or gallops ABD: soft, non-tender, non-distended, BS normoactive.
EXT: wwp, no edema.
No sig hematoma or ecchymosis at left groin site.
The LAD had <50% proximal stenosis, and diffuse irregularities.
The LCX had no angiographically apparent disease.
The RCA had a subtotal ostium occlusion posterolateral branch.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 16 mmHg and PCW of 33 mm Hg.
There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP 54 mm Hg.
There was normal arterial systolic and mildly elevated diastolic pressures at the aortic level with sBP 136 mmHg and DBP of 94 mmHg.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the distal RCA into the PL branch with a 3.0 x 18 mm Promus DES (see PTCA comments).
Single vessel coronary artery disease.
Moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
[**2132-8-18**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
ST segment elevations in leads II, III and aVF with ST segment depressions in leads V2-V3 and V5-V6 and leads I and aVL consistent with acute transmural ischemia in the inferoposterior distribution.
Relatively flat ST segment in lead V1 raises suspicion for acute right ventricular infarction.
[**2132-8-18**] Trans-thoracic Echocardiography The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta and arch are mildly dilated.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 54731**] is a 81yo M with history of HTN and OSA, who was admitted with an inferior [**Known lastname **].
ACUTE # Inferior [**Name (NI) **] - Pt taken to cath and shown to have a subtotal ostium occlusion in the posterolateral branch of the RCA.
There was successful PTCA and stenting of the distal RCA into the posterolateral branch with a 3.0 x 18 mm Promus drug-eluting stent.
# CHF: No history of CHF but has not had an echo since stress echo in [**2122**].
ECHO showed EF 45-50% with mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls, Mild-moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation, and dilated thoracic aorta.
# RHYTHM: Evidence of first degree AV block on EKG back in [**2123**] as well as now.
He was monitored on telemetry and found to be in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
# Obstructive Sleep Apnea: He was continued on CPAP.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Inferior myocardial infarction Hypertension Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because you had a heart attack.
Do not stop taking aspirin and plavix or miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**] unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] says it is OK. You developed a very common irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
You have tolerated this well but you now have an increased risk of stroke.
Therefore, we have started [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 55863**] blood thinner called Dabigitran or Pradaxa to prevent a stroke.
This medicine can cause easy bleeding so you may bruise easily or your gums could bleed with vigorous brushing.
However, you also could have bleeding in your bowel that will give you dark or bloody stools, lightheadedness and dizziness.
Pradaxa: to prevent a stroke from your atrial fibrillation  Please STOP taking the following medications: 1.
