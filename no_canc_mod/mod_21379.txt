He first developed a right upper lung pneumonia and was hospitalized in [**State 4565**] from [**8-8**] to [**8-12**].
He presented to [**Hospital6 **] on [**8-24**] with fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia and cough, and was diagnosed with necrotizing pneumonia due to coccidioides immitis by CT and bronchoalveolar lavage.
He continued to deteriorate and spike fever while on broad antibiotic coverage.
He had been on ceftaz/vanc/flagyl [**8-24**]->unasyn8/26-9/1->levaquine+clinda [**Date range (1) 57510**]->ceftaz+vanc [**Date range (1) 57511**] for bacterial coverage.
The voriconazle was switched to intraconazole due to cholestatic hepatitis.
Mr. [**Known lastname 57508**] was on itraconazole from [**9-11**] to [**9-16**] but it was discontinued given persistent cholestasis and new drug rashes since [**9-15**].
He was also noticed to have worsening hypoxia.
Past Medical History: -Inflammatory Myositis s/p biopsy [**6-3**] started on methotrexate and prednisone, unclear as to etiology (not inclusion body myositis)  Diagnosed at [**Hospital3 2568**]... -coccidomycosis pneumonia -right sided pneumothorax s/p CT -rectal bleeing [**1-31**] hemorrhoids -ARf -hyponatremia -thrombocytopenia -anasarca -cholestatic hepatitis  Social History: retired mechanic married no tobacco occassional etoh born in [**Location (un) 57512**] [**Country **], emigrated here in [**2119**]  Family History: not obtained  Physical Exam: 98.4, 94/50, 92, 24, 94%5L Gen illapearing jaundiced anasarcic male in nad HEENT icteric, EOMI, PERRLA, dry MM with small ulcer on R tongue Neck supple, no lad, jvp not elevated PULM: R lung with coarse rales and wet throughout, L lung with good air movement CVS rrr nl s1 and s2, no rubs, murmers, gallops Abd soft mildly distended, hypoactive BS, HSM not appreciated Ext 4+ pitting edema, 2+ pulses all extremeties Neuro CN intact, AAOx2, cerebellum intact Skin: Bilateral petechial rashes on LEs  Pertinent Results: MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The study is limited by patient motion.
Allowing for this, there are no grossly abnormal areas of enhancement of areas of large signal abnormality demonstrated.
No diffusion signal abnormalities are present to indicate acute infarct.
There are no areas of low signal on susceptibility sequences to indicate the present of blood products.
No evidence of acute infarction.
No grossly abnormal areas of enhancement.
No hydrocephalus.
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]:  TECHNIQUE: 3D time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar reconstructions.
ID: At outside hospital culture data revealed Coccidomycoses in both blood and sputum, enterobacter on [**8-30**] bronchoscopy and GPCs on [**9-16**] bronchoscopy.
A lumbar puncture was performed to determine the need for intrathecal ambisome, however no organisms were seen on microscopy or cultured.
At this hospital, his blood cultures demonstrated Vancomycin resistant enterococcus bacteremia but no coccidomycosis fungemia, sputum cultures showed coccidomycosis, pleural fluid had VRE and coccidomycosis.
Pulm: Patient had Coccidiomycosis and necrotizing PNA.
He suffered a spontaneos pneumothorax with significant subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema.
On [**9-19**] Mr. [**Known lastname 57508**] had an elective intubation for bronchocscopy, [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status and respiratory distress.
The chest tube was replaced for apical suction, the ambisome was increased to 5 mg/kg and caspofungin was added for double coverage.
He was not considered a surgical candidate for lobectomy given his poor clinical condition and widely disseminated coccidiomycosis.
Bronchoscopy revealed diffusely erythematous airways without purulent secretions and a likely RML empyema.
On [**9-22**] chest tube was placed to water seal, no reexpansion of ptx on positive pressure, and he was thought unlikely to have continued broncho-pleural fistula  3.
Hepatic: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 57513**] had a cholestatic hepatitis induced by azoles at the outside hospital.
Ultrasound at outside hospital showed no obstruction.
Viral hepatitis panel was negative.
His LFTs improved during his course, but the patient remained anasarcic and jaundiced.
Derm: Mr. [**Known lastname 57508**] developed a drug rash & a stasis dermatitis in the bilateral lower extremities.
Renal: The patient developed acute renal failure, thought to be secondary to prerenal azotemia.
Rheum: Mr. [**Known lastname 57508**] had a history or "myositis" of unknown subtype.
An EKG done here on [**9-19**], revealed poor Rwave progression.
Cardiac output was boosted with IVF boluses for BP and stress dose steriods, started [**9-19**].
