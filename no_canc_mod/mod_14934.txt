CXR [**12-29**]:  There are bilateral pulmonary opacities in the perihilar regions, left worse than right.
This may represent some failure, bilateral infiltrates cannot be excluded.
ABD US [**12-30**]:  Right liver lobe hemangioma.
Echogenic kidneys representing parenchymal disease.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Worsening asymmetrical perihilar haziness, left greater than right, most likely due to worsening perihilar edema.
No evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
Small amount of simple free fluid in the pelvis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Patchy consolidation in the left lower lobe could represent pneumonia.
Small pericardial effusion.
Probable small hemorrhage in the liver, consistent with recent biopsy.
Acute submassive hepatic necrosis, centrolobular and mid-zonal areas (zones [**1-3**]).
Moderate lobular mononuclear cell inflammation with scattered neutrophils, and minimal portal inflammation.
Mild cholestasis.
Trichrome stain: No increased fibrosis.
Iron stain:  No stainable iron.
Note:  Probable causes include drug/toxic and ischemic disease.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Note: Light Microscopy: The specimen consists of renal cortex and medulla, containing approximately 6 glomeruli, all of which show advanced injury or global sclerosis.
There is moderate to  marked interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy.
Patchy chronic inflammation accompanies the scarring.
Electron Microscopy (C4047) : Fine structural studies of  a single glomerular tuft with advanced injury reveal that most capillaries show obsolescence with loss of cellular elements.
Extensive foot process effacement with areas of total podocyte loss are seen.
Mesangial matrix is increased with occasional granular electron dense deposits.
One loop is more preserved, and shows endocapillary cells with subendothelial electron dense deposits.
No subepithelial deposits are noted.
Interval development of moderate-size perinephric hematoma as above.
Stable appearance of small, bilateral pleural effusions.
Previously evident capsular hematoma is not well seen.
Marked circumferential edema of the gallbladder wall in the setting of luminal contraction, secondary to known underlying liver disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 year old female with history of HTN and nephrolithiasis, transferred from outside hospital with fulminant liver failure and acute on chronic renal failure, admitted to the MICU.
Briefly, her liver failure had almost resolved by the time of discharge.
Her renal failure continued, and she was discharged with anticipation of dialysis in the near future.
The cause of her renal failure also remains unclear.
A number of blood tests were sent off to ascertain the etiology of her liver failure, however they were uniformly negative (these included tylenol, [**Doctor First Name **], CMV, EBV, toxoplasma, Hepatitis serologies, leptospirosis, and porphyria).
She underwent a transjugular liver biopsy on the 3rd day of the admission, which showed a non-specific pattern of injury consistent with drug/toxic or ischemic disease.
She unfortunately developed a subcapsular liver hematoma during the procedure, however this was stabilized with FFP and Vitamin K which the patient had already been receiving.
2) Acute on chronic renal failure:  On admission she was also in acute renal failure with creatinine of 5.7.
Hepatorenal syndrome was in the differential, however her urine sodium was elevated, therefore this diagnosis could not be made.
Initial urine sediment was felt to be consistent with ATN or AIN (RBCs, no acanthocytes, occasional WBC, hyaline casts, occasional renal tubular epithelial cells, granular casts, no muddy brown casts or rbc casts).
A renal US revealed echogenic kidneys consistent with parenchymal disease.
A later urine sediment showed many acanthocytic and dysmorphic rbcs, many casts, granular and bite stained, no WBCs, no RBC casts, occasional RTE cells, and 100 mg/dl protein.
The nephrology team felt that her acute insult had resolved, and the new sediment was suggestive of underlying glomerular injury, the possibilities for which included cryoglobulinemia, lupus, endocarditis, idiopathic MPGN, and post-infectious GN.
The interstitium was severely fibrosed, and there was tubular atrophy, all consistent with advanced injury that could not be specified.
A CT of the abdomen demonstrated a moderate-sized perinephric hematoma.
Her hematocrit stabilized and she had no further flank pain prior to discharge.
Her creatinine on discharge was still markedly above baseline at 6.1, and she was exhibiting mild signs of volume overload (orthopnea, peripheral edema).
3) Pneumonia:  At the outside hospital she had been found to have a LLL PNA and was therefore already on levo/flagyl on transfer.
She remained afebrile throughout her course.
Her wbc was elevated on admission, however this was felt to be related to the acute liver injury, and trended down throughout the admission.
She felt well throughout, and had no shortness of breath other than orthopnea from her fluid overload.
4) Hypertension:  She has a history of hypertension, and had been taking toprol XL 25 mg daily.
5) Anemia:  The patient had a persistently low hematocrit during the admission, however she also had an elevated LDH and persistent nucleated RBCs, therefore hematology/oncology was called.
Review of peripheral smear was consistent with stress hematopoesis due to acute liver failure and not autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
They felt that her elevated LDH and bili, as well as low haptoglobin, were all a result of her liver disease.
She likely has an underlying anemia of chronic disease from her renal failure.
