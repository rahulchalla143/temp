Admission Date: [**2107-12-19**]        Discharge Date: [**2108-1-5**]   Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 9055**] is an 86 year old gentleman with known coronary artery disease with recent increase in dyspnea and fatigue.
His primary care physician referred him due to his worsening dyspnea.
His electrocardiogram had no new ischemic changes.
Cervical spondylosis.
Status post hernia repair.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] where he underwent an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 60 to 70 percent with severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.7 cm sq, a dilated ascending aorta, mild mitral regurgitation.
He underwent VQ scan to rule out pulmonary embolism which showed low suspicion.
The patient underwent a stress MIBI which the patient stopped due to fatigue and chest pressure, a mild inferior wall reversible defect and mild septal akinesis with an ejection fraction of 67 percent.
Patient was referred to the cardiac surgery service and as part of the work up an oral and maxillofacial consult was obtained to rule out any evidence of dental disease and their diagnosis was chronic apical periodontitis of tooth number 20 and 24 with generalized periodontitis.
However, on further evaluation they felt that there were no signs of acute infection and patient was cleared for surgery and patient was taken to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2107-12-27**] where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times three with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery as well as aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**] [**Doctor Last Name **] bovine pericardial valve.
The patient remained intubated and overnight on his first postoperative night and was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation without difficulty.
It was noticed that patient had an irregular rhythm with some element of block and required some ventricular pacing.
The patient began to have some ventricular ectopy and was started on an amiodarone infusion.
It was felt that service that postoperatively the patient had a new right bundle branch block with some preoperative sinus node dysfunction and a postoperative tachyarrhythmia.
Electrophysiology service subsequently felt that the irregular heart rhythm was due to complete heart block and was evidence of AV nodal dysfunction or HIS disease.
The patient continued to be paced intermittently with atrial sensing and ventricular pacing.
He underwent a chest x-ray which showed no pneumothorax and good aeration, mild pulmonary edema and he was started on a low dose beta blocker.
Breath sounds are coarse bilaterally.
Extremities show clean, dry and intact with no erythema or drainage.
The left leg incision is clean and dry without edema.
Renal insufficiency.
History of cervical spondylosis.
Status post hernia repair.
