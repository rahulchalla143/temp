There is some marked narrowing at the distal CBD with some more proximal dilatation.
However, there is no filling defect definitively demonstrated on the submitted images.
IMPRESSION: Markedly narrowed distal CBD without any evidence of a filling defect.
For further details, see the gastroenterology report in CareWeb from the same day.
A GI consult was obtained due to his history of gallstone pancreatitis, and ongoing dull abdominal pain with elevated LFT's.
On POD # 1, he was extubated, and hemodynamically stable, but he was agitated and non-verbal.
It was unclear at the time if this was a neurologic problem vs. psychiatric.
meds were altered, and his mental status improved significantly over the next few days.
Head CT showed no acute process and carotid u/s was normal.
