No thrombus in the LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Focal calcifications in descending aorta.
No masses or vegetations on aortic valve.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Severe mitral annular calcification.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position.
Wires and chest tubes were dc'd without incident.
Endoscopy on [**6-20**] showed two non-bleeding ulcers in the GE junction, mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus, esophagitis and a small hiatal hernia.
She will need follow up endoscopy to monitor the ulcer, as well as colonoscopy for further anemia evalution in 3 months or sooner if evidence of further bleeding.
