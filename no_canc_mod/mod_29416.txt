Patient notes being previously assessed at [**Hospital 27217**] Hospital [**4-15**] weesk ago where he apparently had a 4 day hospitalisation for headaches where CT head was normal and discharged.
He was then at his baseline until 2 days ago when he noted a relatively sudden onset of right temporal headache which was sharp and at times severe.He hadno nausea, vomiting and no visual changes.
She then took him to the ED to evaluate his headaches where at just after 6pm he had a CT which showed a right temporal IPH as above.
Importantly, per his wife, apparently AFTER this at roughly 7pm he then had onset of left weakness and speech difficulties where initilly he could not move the right side at all.
He is now antigravity in both left arm and leg although the arm is weaker than the leg.
He also described some numbness and tingling in his left hand and this seemingly subsided.
He also felt light-headed and noted cough, SOB and some chest tightness with wheezing while in [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 27217**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (has COPD).

Minimal associated mass effect without evidence of herniation or shift of midline structures.
Encephalomalacia related to prior right frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
CT HEAD [**2125-4-30**] Unchanged exam with stable right temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic edema and minimally associated mass effect.
Further workup to exclude underlying vascular/neopalstic etiology; correlate clinically for coagulopathy/amyloid angiopathy.
Underlying lesion cannot be excluded.
CXR [**2125-4-30**] Status post right thoracic surgery, most likely lobectomy, recording rib defects and clips in situ.
Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
At the site of resection on the right, there is no evidence of recurrence.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes, probably normal variant.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2125-4-29**] no change.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 76 176 88 364/392 58 12 55  Cerebral angiogram [**2125-5-2**]: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 23147**] underwent cerebral angiography which revealed that there were no vascular sources for his right hemispheric hemorrhages, specifically no AVM, arteriovenous fistula or vasculitis was identified.
He does have an occlusion of his right common iliac artery just beyond the aortic bifurcation.
There is a small hemangioma at L1 vertebral body.
The conus medullaris is normal in morphology and intrinsic signal intensity and terminates at the L1-2 level.
There is a normal distribution of cauda equine nerve roots.
The paravertebral and limited included retroperitoneal soft tissues are grossly unremarkable.
At L1-L2 and L2-3 there are mild disc bulges but no spinal canal stenosis or neuroforaminal narrowing.
At L3-L4, there is a disc bulge with a left annular tear touching the left L3 nerve root in the left neural foramen.
At L4-L5, there is a disc bulge with an annular tear on the left.
There is also bilateral facet arthrosis which in combination with the disc bulge is causing compression of the right L4 nerve root and also contacting the left [**Name (NI) 5774**] nerve root.
There is ligamentum flavum thickening but no spinal canal stenosis.
At L5-S1, there is a disc bulge with an annular tear but no spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 62 yo RHM h/o prior right parietal IPH ([**2119**]) c/b seizures, lung cancer (s/p right lobectomy, chemotherapy, radiation), PAF, CKD, HTN, COPD p/w severe right periorbital/temporal headache and subsequently sudden onset aphasia and left hemiparesis.
He was transferred from an OSH with a finding of a 3.2 x 2.9 cm right temporal IPH and was admitted to the Neuro ICU for close monitoring and blood pressure control.
His deficits quickly improved but overnight on [**2125-4-29**] he did have some worsening of LLE weakness which had resolved by the morning.
Given concerns regarding the nature of his hemorrhage, he had an MRI Brain with contrast which (other than the hemorrhage) showed no underlying obvious mass or vascular malformation.
Neurosurgery was consulted to perform a diagnostic cerebral angiogram to identify a possible arteriovenous dural fistula or other cerebral vascular malformation as a possible etiology of his two hemorrhages.
This was done following the administration of steroids, H1 and H2 blockers as well as a bicarbonate preparation given his 1) chronic kidney disease with Cr 1.7-1.8, and 2) history of iodine contrast allergy.
This also unfortunately did not identify an etiology of his intraparenchymal hemorrhages.
This procedure was complicated a small groin hematoma that was not noticeable the next day.
He did complain of some local right sided hip pain which was limiting motion of his right lower extremity.
We obtained hip films and a lumbar spine MRI which showed no acute injury, fracture or radicular/plexus lesion, which was reassuring.
He also reassured us that he has had problems with hip pain in the past.
His pain was well controlled with PO analgesics and he obtained good relief from his pain following one dose of IV toradol.
