Admission Date:  [**2120-12-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-1-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2040-2-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Recurrent Intracranial hemorrhage   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: NONE   History of Present Illness: 80 year-old woman with a history of a recent right frontal hemorrhage with left hemiparesis (discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**12-6**]), hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease s/p MI with stent placement, and hypothyroidism, who returns today as a transfer from an outside hospital for worsening left-sided weakness.
According to her nurse, on Friday, the patient was able to sit in a chair, feed herself, say short phrases, and move her left arm and leg "to a limited extent."
Today, the nurse noted the patient had a notable left-sided flaccid hemiplegia.
By report, a head CT there revealed a new right frontal bleed, more posterior than her prior.
There was mild associated edema but no significant mass effect.
TSH was significantly elevated at 20.2.
Urinalysis was concerning for a urinary tract infection: turbid, large blood ([**10-23**] RBC), 30 protein, large leukocyte esterase, positive nitrites, many bacteria, and rare calcium oxalate crystals.
Of note, she was admitted to the neurologic-ICU on [**11-19**] for a large, spontaneous right lobar hemorrhage with edema.
There was and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and 4 mm shift to the left.
A small amount of hydrocephalus as well as subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage was noted.
Her hemorrhage was stable with sequential imaging.
Though there was concern for amyloid angiopathy as the underlying process, an MRI did not reveal microbleeds.
A CTA did not reveal an underlying vascular malformation.
On transfer to the floor, she developed hyponatremia to ~127 that improved after her hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued.
She also developed a urinary tract infection with both enterococcus and E. coli which was treated with a week course of vancomycin and ceftriaxone respectively.
Minimally responsive to touch or voice.

Cranial Nerves: Could not assess fundi as patient actively closed eyes on attempts to examine; there is no clear deficit of visual fields on blink to threat.
Moves eyes to left and right spontaneously, but does not follow commands for assessment of vertical gaze, no nystagmus seen.
Left facial weakness noted in lower face.
No tremor or adventitious movements seen.
Unchanged appearance of right parietooccipital parenchymal hematoma with an old evolving right parasagittal frontal hematoma; this overall appearance is suggestive of underlying amyloid angiopathy.
Persistent mass effect.
Disproportionate temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] dilatation suggests more severe medial temporal atrophy, raising the concern for Alzheimer's disease (which may be associated with amyloid angiopathy).
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
No new hemorrhage or fracture.
No significant interval changes, with the known intraparenchymal hemotomas, peri-hemorrhagic edema and mass effect as described above.
ENDO: Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism was known prior to admission yet TSH and free T4 values were obtained to show a need for additional thyroixine supplementation.
Medications on Admission: Atorvastatin 80 mg po daily -Acetaminophen 325 mg tablet, 1-2 Tablets every 6 hours as needed for fever, pain -Memantine 10 mg daily -Levothyroxine 88 mcg daily -Amlodipine 2.5 mg daily -Lisinopril 20 mg daily -Senna 8.6 mg [**Hospital1 **] as needed for constipation -Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Medications: 1.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Senna 8.8 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 5176**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right frontal hemorrhage Amyloid Angiopathy Hypothyroidism Right frontal hemorrhage, as discussed above -s/p PEG placement [**12-4**] -Coronary artery disease s/p MI with prox LAD taxus stent -Hypertension -Dyslipidemia -s/p left knee surgery   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Eyelid apraxia, Left hemiparesis (leg>arm), Left hyperreflexia, and upgoing toe.
This was most likely due to amyloid angiopathy.
Return to the ER if your symptoms recur, you have persistent nausea and vomiting or any motor deficits.
