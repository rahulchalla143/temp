Except for mild bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.
Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is present.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
There is a linear opacity below the left hemidiaphragm that could potentially represent free intraperitoneal air, but these findings were not redemonstrated on the dedicated decubitus view, thus unlikely to represent true pathology.
Compared to the prior study, there is no interval development of  consolidations worrisome for infectious process.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette including dextroscoliosis is unchanged.
There is no evidence of free air within the limitations of this study seen.
There is minimal degree of left pleural effusion.
Right upper lobe opacity is either new or more conspicuous than on prior studies and is consistent with infectious process/pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small.
Bibasilar opacities could be atelectasis.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
Cardiac size is mildly enlarged.
Brief Hospital Course: 57F depression, prior psychosis, prior suicidal attempts, diabetes mellitus type II, admitted following suicide attempt.
Toxicology screen also positive for cocaine.
Gabapentin toxicity manifests largely as somnolence; patient very somnolent in ED, and intermittently in ICU, where she was transferred for somnolence and hypotension.
Toxicology service consulted and recommended serial ECGs and supportive care.
Pt had some continued episodes of agitation and paranoia, was evaluated for psych placement.
Given low likelihood for alcohol withdrawal and so as to not cloud recovery from above ingestions, no CIWA scale was initiated.
Acute kidney injury: presumed to be pre-renal in setting of somnolence and poor PO intake, improved with fluids.
Productive cough: No evidence of infiltrate while in the ICU, however pt had upper lobe infiltrate while on the floor, and therefore was started on a course of levofloxicin, to be continued for 3 days after discharge.
No surrounding erythema or purulence drainage.
Continued wound care.
She was hypertensive while on the floor in the setting of agitation, restarted on home dose of lisinopril.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
You also had a fever and were started on levofloxacin for treatment of pneumonia, you should finish three days of this medication after you leave the hospital.
This may need to be uptitrated as an outpt -Start taking folate/multivitamin/thiamine -your spironolactone was held given your recent acute renal failure, and no evidence of volume overload.
