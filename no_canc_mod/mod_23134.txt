History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 60yo woman with h/o hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, fibromyalgia and CAD s/p BMS to the left Cx in [**2130-7-22**].
The LAD and Cx were treated with bare metal stents.
She has felt well for several months following her procedure in [**5-31**] but then developed a recurrence of chest discomfort.
She has not had stress testing since her last PCI and is now referred for relook catheterization with possible surgical revascularization.
+ Increase in dyspnea with exertion or when bending over.
Past Medical History: Coronary artery disease s/p coronary artery bypass garfts noninsulin dependent Diabetes mellitus Dyslipidemia Hypertension obstructive Sleep Apnea fibromyalgia   Social History: Patient is married without children.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: JVP not elevated above clavicle.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
Focal opacity overlying thoracic vertebra on lateral view likely represents degenerative changes.
However, recommend left and right lateral oblique views to rule out lung nodule.
Small left mid lung linear atelectasis.
Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
-[**10-9**] CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE: IMPRESSION: No evidence of carotid artery stenosis bilaterally.
-[**10-11**] CXR obliques: IMPRESSION: Routine frontal and a shallow lateral oblique were performed to evaluate questionable lung nodule projecting over the lower thoracic spine on conventional radiographs taken [**2132-10-9**].
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No new valvular lesions.
This revealed severe three vessel disease and the cardiac surgical service was consulted.
A carotid ultrasound showed no evidence of carotid artery stenosis bilaterally.
The neurology service was consulted given her history of stroke and cerebral bleed.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient experienced difficulty with self administration due to her baseline cognitive deficits.
Additionally, the sternal incision developed erythema at the inferior pole and the patient was started on IV Ancef.
By the time of discharge on POD 9 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
