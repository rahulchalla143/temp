HPI:  62 yo right handed man with history of chronic back pain and ?syncopal events presents with first time seizure today witnessed at home by his wife and daughter.
There was no loss of consciousness.
They returned because they heard banging and found him having a generalized seizure with tonic stiffening.
There was no cyanosis.
He was making gurggling sounds and had urinary incontinence.
As the ambulance was leaving the house within 10minutes of the last seizure, he had a second generalized seizure which resolved prior to arrival at [**Hospital6 **].
He was considered in status because of no return to his baseline in between the seizures or after the seizure and was givn Ativan 2mg.
He did not have significant white count and his urine and chest xray did not show signs of infection.
Today, he did not report to his family and concerns for infection with fever, UTI symptoms, cough, rhinnorhea.
He had been having significant back pain over the last two days which he thought was due to the change in weather and also the fact he had been working on the generator preparing for the hurricane which could have aggrevated his back pain.
His grandson was [**Name2 (NI) **] with strep throat who he had contact with this weekend but [**Name (NI) 12395**] himself was not complaining of a sorethroat or fever.
His family wasn't sure the total of extent of his injury but think he had L4/L5 vertebral disc protrusion and stenosis of the canal.
His wife reports that this weekend he told her that he had having nearsyncopal events about once a month but didn't tell her more detail regarding that.
There is a small scabbed head lac- 1cm long Cor: RRR, nl S1, S2.
No m/r/g appreciated.
Skin: mild erythema on chest.
Pupils equal 2mm pinpoint and minimally reactive bilaterally.
Could not test babinski because of withdrawal.
He is localizing to pain in his lower extremitites but not reliably in upper extremities.
No focal, lateralized or discharging abnormalities were noted.
In fact, much of the record represented drowsiness, with brief periods of wakefulness and rapid returns to stage I sleep.
CARDIAC MONITOR: No arrythmias noted.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG, because of the patient's inability to maintain full wakefulness.
While the brief waking rhythms were seen to be normal for age, the state instability would suggest a mild early diffuse encephalopathy.
No evidence for a discharging abnormality or clear focality was seen.
No evidence of mass lesion, hydronephrosis, or cortical thinning.
Per report from the family, he had been experiencing increased back pain lately and had likely been taking more than his daily allotted amount of tramadol.
This all later improved, and prior to discharge, his neurological examination was positive for some stable old right sided ptosis (without miosis), normal gait and coordination and full strength and sensation throughout.
He was independent and ambulatory without support.
PROBLEMS Seizures: [**Name2 (NI) **] he was initially started on dilantin for his two seizures, he had an extensive work up to rule out secondary causes of symptomatic seizures.
His EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and his MRI was normal.
He also had an extensive metabolic work up (see below) which revealed no obvious source of infection, metabolic abnormality or electrolyte derangements.
I spoke with his physiatrist directly, and conveyed our thoughts about tramadol being a cause for lowered seizure threshold.
He is to be seen by his physiatrist in one week (see below) where they will together come up with an alternative pain regimen.
Iron studies revealed evidence for iron deficiency.
The etiology may be related to indolent hemorrhoidal bleeding, although the patient does not report overt bleeding in his stools.
He was without signs of infection or fever throughout his stay.
3. hydrocodone-acetaminophen 5-500 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 6 days.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Seizures Chronic Lower Back Pain   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized at the Neurology ICU and Wards of the [**Hospital1 1535**] for two generalized convulsions or seizures.
Use them only on days when your pain is significantly worse than usual.
- Continue to take your flexeril (as needed) and lyrica daily as augmenting pain agents.
This may be as a consequence of sources of bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract such as polyps, hemorrhoids or a tumor.
