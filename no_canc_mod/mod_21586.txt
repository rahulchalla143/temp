Small bowel resection  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 68 year old male with a 38 year history of Crohn's disease, coronary artery disease, previous small bowel obstruction, and congestive heart failure, status post resection of small bowel three times ([**2136**], [**2154**], [**2164**]) who presented from [**Doctor Last Name 1495**] [**Hospital 107**] Medical center with abdominal pain.
He has had occasional flares of cramps, partial small bowel obstructions treated with IV fluids and increased doses of prednisone.
He also has had complications involving recurrent perianal fistulas as well.
This resulted in him presenting to the outside institution for a colonoscopy, and the results demonstrated some ileitis with no colitis.
The the next day ([**2174-7-20**]), Three weeks prior to the admission to this hospital, the patient experienced the acute onset of abdominal pain.
A CT was suggestive of a potential small bowel perforation.
However, he had persistent pain that was aggrevated by taking anything by mouth.
He did have some fevers on presentation.
Coronory artery disease 3.
Status post exploratory laparotomy complicated by MI (in past) 4.
Small bowel obstruction 5.
Congestive heart failure ([**7-24**] EF=39% with no reversable defects  Social History: Retired, Married, no alcohol, no cigarettes  Family History: No history of crohn's disease  Physical Exam: Temperature 98.6, Heart rate 76, Blood pressure 110/70, Respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 99% on room air  General: well nourished and well hydrated Head and neck:  pupils equal round and reactive to light.
neck supple, trachea midline, no cervical lymphadenopathy Chest: clear to auscultation bilaterally Heart: regular rate and rhythm Abdomen: obese, distended.
some focal tenderness in left upper quadrant.
No guarding or rebound tenderness Extremities: no clubbing cyanosis or edema  Pertinent Results: [**2174-8-6**] 11:09PM BLOOD WBC-9.5 RBC-3.77* Hgb-12.6* Hct-36.6* MCV-97 MCH-33.5* MCHC-34.5 RDW-14.1 Plt Ct-99* [**2174-8-6**] 11:09PM BLOOD PT-13.2 PTT-25.7 INR(PT)-1.4 [**2174-8-6**] 11:09PM BLOOD Glucose-106* UreaN-46* Creat-1.4* Na-131* K-4.3 Cl-94* HCO3-27 AnGap-14 [**2174-8-6**] 11:09PM BLOOD ALT-37 AST-21 AlkPhos-65 Amylase-108* TotBili-0.4 [**2174-8-6**] 11:09PM BLOOD Lipase-62* [**2174-8-6**] 11:09PM BLOOD Albumin-2.5* Calcium-8.0* Phos-2.5* Mg-2.1  [**2174-8-7**], [**2174-8-8**], [**2174-8-9**] Blood Cultures:    AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2174-8-10**]):       STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
[**2174-8-9**]: Central line tip: Staphlococcus, coagulase negative  CT Abdomen and pelvis [**2174-8-8**]: The visualized lung bases demonstrate tiny bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectatic changes.
Sludge and stones are identified within the gallbladder, but no secondary signs of cholecystitis are identified.
Allowing for this, there is a focal loop of small bowel within the left hemiabdomen, likely mid jejunum, which demonstrates wall thickening.
At least two, possibly three fluid collections are identified adjacent to this loop of small bowel.
This constellation of findings is most compatible with active Crohn's disease.
No free air is identified.
There are no discernible colonic abnormalities to indicate the occurrence of perforation from recent colonoscopy.
CT OF PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is collapsed due to the presence of a Foley catheter, limiting evaluation.
There is high-density contrast material within the colon, as above, limiting evaluation.
No free fluid or air is identified.
Focal wall thickening of a loop of mid jejunum with at least two adjacent small fluid collections.
These findings are most compatible with active Crohn's disease in a patient with this history.
Limited evaluation of colon demonstrates no evidence of complications from recent colonoscopy.
Sludge and stone-containing gallbladder without evidence of cholecystitis.
Tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
He grew out coag negative staph from in his blood cultures, and his central line was pulled and he was started on vancomycin.
The GI service thought that this was not consistent with a crohn's flare, and they suggested a rapid taper of his steroids.
He was stable until the evening of hospital day number 2, when he had the acute onset of Left lower quadrant abdominal pain.
The pain was sharp, and his exam was concerning for some questionable guarding in the left lower quadrant.
However, he did not have any truly positive peritoneal signs.
He got an upright chest and abdominal xray that did not show any free air, but did show dilated bowel loops.
An NG tube was placed, and he had serial abdominal exams overnight.
His exam worsened, and he had clear peritoneal signs in the left lower quadrant.
he also became tachycardic to the 110s, and his urine output decreased.
Gross spillage of stool was noted on the exploratory laparotomy, and a segment of small bowel was resected in the area of jejunal diverticuli.
He was transfered to the intensive care unit, intubated and required massive fluid resuscititation for his septic picture.
THe patient continued to be diuresed and had wound changes done twice a day.
On [**8-28**], the patient became tachypneic and became tachycardic.
The patient was transferred to the unit the next day for closer management of his cardiac status.
The patient had a repeat episode of chest pain for approxiamtley for 2 hours on the the 11th and and was evaluted by on surgery and cardiology.
The patient ruled out for an myocardial infarction and the nitro drip was discontinued.
