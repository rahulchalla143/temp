CXR was consistant with pulmonary edema.
Pt had intermittent episodes of rapid a fib which were controlled with IV beta blockers.
While in the ICU in the am of [**4-20**], pt had an episode of coffee-ground emesis.
GI consulted and said that scoping at this point was not recommended as pt had recent hypotension, a stable Hct, and no frank blood on lavage.
Pt was on transferred to the floor and had signs and symptoms consistant with stroke.
MRI revealed a small ischemic stroke in the corona radiata on the left.
Pressures were kept ~100 as there was a tight balance between rate control and pressure control.
He was stable overnight in the unit, received no intervention, and was transferred back to the medicine team now.
HTN 3.
CAD s/p CABG 6.
Chronic Afib  Social History: Pt is a former bartender.
He is a former bartender, has never been married and has no children.
Lungs: Crackles at bases b/l.

No definite underlying consolidation is identified; however, if pneumonia is suspected, followup films may be helpful.
MR head [**2191-4-23**]-FINDINGS: On diffusion images, a small area of hyperintense signal is seen within the left corona radiata, which could represent an acute subcortical infarct.
Moderate to severe brain atrophy is noted.
Increased signal is seen in the periventricular white matter due to small vessel disease.
IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited study secondary to motion.
Small area of hyperintense signal seen on diffusion images in the left corona radiata could represent a small acute infarct.
Moderate to severe changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
No definite left ventricular thrombus is seen (images suboptimal).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is minimal aortic stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 67M DM2, HTN, COPD, PVD, CAD s/p CABG, CHF, ESRD on HD admitted for hypoxia, and a. fib in rapid ventricular response with resultant hypotension.
pneumonia and with episode of hematemesis in MICU.
Pt has CHF in the setting of ESRD and and likely rapid a. fib as well.
[**2191-4-28**] pt febrile, tachypnic without hypoxia.
He did have a resp alkalosis with increase of Aa gradient.
Received tylenol PR and Mg 2 g. Fever from likely line infection (started on zosyn and vanc) with cultures.
He initially did not tolerate it secondary to fluctuation of pressures and hypotention.
[**Name (NI) 2694**] Pt with CAD s/p CABG.
c. [**Name (NI) 9520**] Pt came in in rapid a. fib with rapid ventricular response with possible flash.
He remained in atrial fibrillation.
He had a 49 beat run of Vtach during that time but no evidence of EKG changes.
Opthamology came by initially but pt refused dilated eye exam.
Stroke- The day after admission to the medicine service, pt with slurred speech, altered mental status, and problems swallowing.
[**Name2 (NI) 430**] CT showed areas of old stroke and large ventricles.
MRI showed acute left corona radiata ischemic stroke.
In the unit previously he had aspiration PNA which was treated with levo/flagyl 11 day course.
This was likely in the setting of better rate control, better filling, and atrial kick.
Coffee ground emesis- Pt had an episode coffee ground emesis in unit with INR 10.8.
Would  have needed access for dialysis to have changed given his fungemia but pt was made CMO (see below)  12.
Wound care- pt with left heel ulcer and left upper back duoderm in place.
He was not eating and his nutritional status was quite poor; pt said that he has no appetite.
He was sick of being in his condition and knew that it was time for him to be comfortable.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Healthcare-[**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Congestive heart failure Hypotension Atrial fibrillation Fungemia Stroke Aspiration pneumonia  Secondary diagnosis: End stage renal disease Diabetes Mellitus Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease   Discharge Condition: Pt has decided to be CMO.
