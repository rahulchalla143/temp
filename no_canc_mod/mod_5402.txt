Admission Date:  [**2140-10-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-10-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-11-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9554**] Chief Complaint: fatigue, chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 25 year old woman with history of anemia, GERD (H. pylori), Bell's palsy, BRBPR, and several episodes of malaria who was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 25340**] for newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy presents today as a direct admit for worsening chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion for close monitoring via placement of a swan ganz catheter.
She began to notice a real decline in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year, and also began to notice chest pain/tightness and shortness of breath.
Over the next months this chest pain has been present all the time, but increases in intensity nearly every day, usually at night.
It is substernal, sharp and radiates to her back via her left side; it is associated with palpitations, and has a pleuritic component.
She also notes lightheadedness and dizzyness especially with standing.
She has some abdominal cramping and has a history of GERD and gastritis to which she atrributes these symptoms.
She denies recent episodes of inactivity (long plane or car trips), and denies recent OCP use.
Anemia - what type of work up?
GERD - patient relates that she was H. pylori positive and was treated with a [**1-24**] day course of antibiotics with good resolution of sx sub subsequently.
She still notes epigastric pain about once a week.
History of several episodes of malaria.
Social History: The patient used to smoke casually (she estimates 1 pack per year) but quit in [**Month (only) **] when her chest pain began.
She very occasionally drinks but has not had any recent binges.
From previous OMR notes, the patient has had a difficult time over the past few years with episodes of homelessness.
Currently she is living in an apartment with roommates, and working.
Family History: Her brother has recently been told he has an irregular heart rhythm but has not had it worked up as of yet.

No evidence of sarcoidosis.
2) Left renal cyst.
3) Collection of air in the right upper quadrant, most likely representing duodenum, however, please correlate with physical examination.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30-40 percent).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Stress results ([**9-30**]) IMPRESSION: No objective evidence of myocardial ischemia by EKG in the setting of atpyical anginal symptoms and shortness of breat at a moderate absolute workload.
RPP - 26,000 MPHR - 84%   Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 25 year old woman with a 4 year history of progressive fatigue and recent chest pain, palpitations, and signs of volume overload (orthopnea, PND, increased AM urination, air hunger) who has been recently diagnosed with cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology and partially worked up.
She was admitted for further workup and possible invasive monitoring via swan ganz catheter.
Rate/rhythm - During her hospitalization, the patient was in sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs and ventricular bigeminies.
Pump - On an ECHO done on [**2140-10-14**], the patient's EF was 30-40%; however, the patient was in ventricular bigeminy during the procedure making the EF results questionable.
Cardiomyopathy workup - The patient per her recent ECHO had a depressed EF but no significant dilation or hypertrophy.
Causes of cardiomyopathy that seemed most likely included: - Tachycardia associated - specifically ventricular outflow tract VT.
- Sarcoid - this type of infiltrative cardiomyopathy was high on the differential given the patient's demographics as well as the ?hilar findings on the chest xray.
An ACE level was sent and was pending on discharge; a chest CT did not show any hilar lymphademopathy or any concerning findings for sarcoid.
- peripartum - her fatigue symptoms started around time of her last miscarriage making this a likely etiology; however, peripartum CM is usually a dilated CM.
- viral/infectious - a possible cause given the patient's upbringing partially in [**Country 16573**], and recent sinus and ear infection earlier this year though these infections were not temporally related to her symptoms.
Chagas disease is also a possibility though she is not from an endemic area and usually the presentation is later in life.
- Ephedra related - patient took ephedra last year for two weeks, and this drug has been associated with cardiac abnormalities including cardiomyopathy Less likely causes: - Connective tissue dz - [**Doctor First Name **] neg.
- Hemochromatosis - not consistent with her anemia and iron studies done in the past.
- Endomyocardial fibrosis - Malignancy (carcinoid) - her sx don't fit the picture of this disease Again, this is all supposing that the patient does in fact have cardiomyopathy - the diagnosis has been brought into question given the rhythm abnormalities during the last ECHO.
Pulmonary - right hilar abnormality in previous CXR, but not present on chest CT.
GI - h/o gastritis, GERD, BRBPR, had been scheduled for a colonoscopy on Friday [**10-21**] but had to miss it due to her admission.
ID - During admission the patient was afebrile, without a white count.
Hematologic - Anemic, she has been worked up in the past, and results were consistent with iron deficiency.
Dispo - patient with seemingly multiple social problems at least in the past - a social work consult was requested and spoke with the patient.
Anemia   Discharge Condition: Good, tolerating an oral diet, ambulaory, afebrile.
