Patient was discharged on [**3-29**] and now returns from rehab with hypotension and ?
right leg cellulitis and black toes.
Patient also states that he had a fever at rehab yesterday.
In ED patient with low blood pressure SBP <80 mmHg and sepsis protocol was initiated.

Left shoulder rotator cuff evulsion fracture 19.
GNR/bacteremia line infection  Social History: Patient lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 5176**] and presented Rehab.
Family History: [**Name (NI) 1094**] father died at age 56 of MI, with DM and a "big heart".
Mother died age 84 of "old age" s/p CVA, with DM and HTN.
Neck: No LAD, JVD not appreciated Chest/Lungs: Left dialysis line in place, non-tender or erythematous.
Lungs CTA B/L, no crackles or wheezes Cardiac: RRR S1/S2 Abdomen: large midline scar, slight diffuse tenderness, no rebound or gaurding Ext: Atrophic LE B/L, multiple finger and L toe amputations.
R foot swollen and tender on dorsal aspect.
@nd and 3rd digit of toe appear to black and possible subcutaneous hematoma.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with basal inferolateral and inferior hypokinesis.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.
CT abd [**2183-4-10**]: IMPRESSION: 1) Dense bilateral lower lobe and right middle lobe consolidations, in a pattern most consistent with aspiration pneumonitis.
2) Splenomegaly with chronic segmental infarction.
3) Diffuse mesenteric stranding, small amount of ascites, and subcutaneous edema, consistent with fluid overload.
5) Left intrahepatic pneumobilia.
Atrophic native kidneys with multiple probable simple cysts too small to characterize.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 57 y/o with ESRD, PVD, DM type 1, hypothyroidism, Hep C cirrhosis who presents with hypotension and R foot cellulitis .
Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock.
The source was suspected line infection vs pulmonary vs foot infection/cellulitis.
He was covered with broad spectrum antibiotics including vanc/flagyl/meropenum to cover pulmonary organisms as well as ESBL klebsiella given his previous history.
CT abdomen and plain films of his foot were obtained to rule out intra-abdominal and osteomyelitis as possible sources of infection.
Respiratory Distress: In the morning on [**4-13**], the patient was noted to be in mild respiratory distress.
The assessment was that this was secondary to CHF vs PNA.
He was noted to be unresponsive and the physician team was called to the bedside.
He was noted to have a pulse in regular rhythm, although blood pressure was unable to be measured due to his poor vascular status, a measurement was not able to be attempted.
Given the patient's clearly expressed desire to be DNR/DNI, there were no chest compressions or chemical coding maneuvers.
His dialysis catheter was maintained with the plan to treat through the bacteremia, given that it would be a difficult procedure for the patient to undergo the placement of another dialysis line given his vascular status and multiple bleeding risk factors.
He was placed on CVVH for volume management.
## Thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy: Patient was found to have new thrombocytopenia, HIT antibody was found to be positive.
## Hep C cirrhosis: There is a history of grade II varices per EGD [**2182-7-25**], elevated coags.
He was unable to take lactulose or rifaximin due to inability to take PO.
## PVD: There was some initial concern in the ED for acute ischemia, with blue toes.
The patient has severe PVD with history of finger amputations.
Per vascular there was no evidence of acute limb ischemia.
## DM Type 1: The plasma sugars were followed closely and treated aggressively with insulin.
## Access: L dialysis line, R PIV ## FEN - [**Month/Day/Year **], diabetic diet.
He was unable to take PO after HD 1 because of poor mental status.
NG tube was not placed because of the esophageal varices.
