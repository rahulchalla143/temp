He has had multiple access procedures, and the most recent hemodialysis line was placed approximately two months ago by [**Hospital1 18**] AV care.
For approximately one week, he has been having yellow discharge around the catheter.
He had HD on Friday, at which time he had a temperature of 101 and yellow discharge.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with bacteremia from infected hemodialysis line for continued management.
Past Medical History: Endocarditis, Mitral Regurgitation, Hypertension, asthma, anemia, restless leg syndrome, ESRD/HD, Gastric Esophageal Reflux Disease, multiple AV grafts bilateral upper extremities, bilateral nephrectomies for renal carcinoma, s/p bilateral parathyroidectomy   Social History: Currently incarcerated.

No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
Mildly dilated RV cavity.
Mild global RV free [**Known lastname **] hypokinesis.
Large vegetation on mitral valve.
PERICARDIUM: Very small pericardial effusion.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free [**Known lastname **] hypokinesis.
An aortic annular abscess is seen.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a large vegetation on the mitral valve.
There is an abscess cavity seen adjacent to the mitral valve.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Aortic valve is poorly seen in the deep transgastric view.
There is a small transvalvular gradien of 15 mmHG.
There is an eccentric paravalvuklar leak that originates near the anterior mitral leaflet side of the aortic annulus.
The LVEF is now 40% with inferior hypokinesis.
The RV is severely hypokinetic and dilated.
Note is also made of bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis/consolidation.
A substernal hematoma is unchanged from [**0-0-0**].
Extensive osseous sclerosis is unchanged, consistent with renal osteodystrophy.
He is a 47 year old male with End Stage Renal Disease secondary to hypertension, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 498**] [**Hospital1 1559**] with an infected right groin hemodialysis line on [**2156-7-31**].
He has had multiple access procedures, and the most recent hemodialysis line was placed approximately 2 months ago by [**Hospital1 18**] AV care.
For approximately 1 week prior to admission to [**Hospital1 498**] he had been having yellow discharge around the catheter.
He had hemodialysis on Friday, at which time he had a temperature of 101 and yellow discharge.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with bacteremia from an infected hemodialysis line for continued management.
He was on the surgical floors for several days when he became septic and hypotensive requiring pressors and a transfer to the surgical intensive care unit.
An echo revealed severe mitral regurgitation with large vegetations.
A transesophageal echocardiogram also revealed an aortic annular abscess.
On [**8-6**] he became hypoxic and was intubated.
Later that day he was brought emergently to the operating room for aortic and mitral valve replacements with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], please see operative report for details.
pericardial patch closure of aortic valve annular abscess.
Additionally with any weaning of sedation he would become profoundly agitated and vacillated between hypotension and hypertension requiring resedation.
He was also having episodes of Atrial fibrillation which was initially treated with Amiodarone that lead to bradycardia and discontinuation of the Amiodarone.
Patient returned to sinus rhythm for a period and then went back into a-fib, he was eventually started on Amiodarone without difficulty and his betablockers were increaed for desired effect.
He developed VRE bacteremia and enterocus pneumonia in the postop period and required several mores days of pressor therapy.
He was initially extubated a few days after his initial surgery but was reintubated for respiratory distress.
He was hemodynamically unstable with rising LFTs and Lactic acid, work-up revealed, percardial hematoma causing tampanade and was brought back to the OR on POD#6 for evacutaion.
He remained intubated for several more days afterwards, due to hypoxia due to fluid overload and agitation.
He contined to have access issues post-op, left AVF remained clotted, and on POD#18 he had a left groin tunnelled HD cath placed as well as a right PICC.
His antibiotics were adjusted per ID, he was switched to cefepime and daptomycin,  he was positive for c-diff and started on PO vanco ([**8-18**])  A chest CT done o [**8-22**] as part of his work-up for line placement revealed RLL abscess.A repeat Chest CT was obtain prior to discharge and it showed an unchnaged abcess (see reports.
Mr [**Known lastname **] remains in custody but has continued to progress and has been deemed safe to be discharged [**Hospital6 90138**] in [**Doctor First Name 3094**], MA on Rt 57 for further strengthening, conditioning and medical management  PO amiodarone started on [**8-25**] for post-op A-fib  ***He has an Anti-C antibody which could lead to a delayed transfusion reaction in the future.
