Admission Date:  [**2101-9-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-10-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2052-4-4**]       Sex:  F  Service:  GOLD SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease for about 12 years.
She is status post Billroth type II gastrotomy with subsequently multiple abdominal surgeries, including a Roux-en-Y for biliary drainage.
These surgical interventions were all the consequence for initial peptic ulcer disease treatment.
She presented again to the Emergency Room with worsening nausea and vomiting with diarrhea and biliary emesis.
Peptic ulcer disease status post Billroth II, Roux-en-Y to common bile duct, times two revisions of gastrojejunostomy secondary to anastomotic stenosis, status post microperforation leading to abdominal abscess, status post EGD and small bowel follow through which showed short Roux limb with reflux into the stomach and stenosis in the efferent limb.
Anemia of chronic disease.
History of vertebral fracture with steroid use.
Chronic diarrhea.
ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT IS ALLERGIC TO SULFA.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix 10 mg q.d., Dilaudid 8 mg q.3-4 hours p.r.n., Ativan, Protonix 40 mg q.d., ............... 1 g q.i.d., Compazine 10 mg q.d., Vitamin D 50,000 U every Friday, Fentanyl patch 225 mcg q.72 hours, continued Zosyn 4.5 g q.4 hours for bacteremia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  On admission exam showed a middle-aged woman in no acute distress.
Vital signs:  She was afebrile with a temperature of 98.4?????
There was no murmur.
Abdomen:  The patient had extensive surgical scars, diffusely tender without any rebound.
Extremities:  No peripheral edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Service with management of her symptoms of nausea and vomiting.
Given the patient's history of her problems with biliary vomiting, inability to tolerate food intake since her gastric operations, and her multiple surgical procedures, and the most recent endoscopy showed that there was a finding of segment in the Roux of only 8 or 9 cm long which probably led to significant reflux problems, she was then scheduled to have takedown of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy of recreation of another Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy with feeding tube placed in the jejunum.
The operation had an estimated blood loss of 200 cc, and the patient was subsequently transferred to the Postsurgical Intensive Care Unit intubated and sedated.
Blood culture monitoring and sputum culture obtained in the unit showed that she had bacteremia with coag negative staph.
On postoperative day #10, she was found to have enough drainage where a cutaneous fistula was suspected.
Over the course of the hospital stay, her surgical wound continued to improve with decreased level of drainage, and therefore, there was no surgical repair performed.
She is somewhat difficult to manage for her pain control issues.
She was placed on a prolonged time of patient-controlled anesthesia with Dilaudid, and on the day prior to discharge, she was placed on her preadmission regimen of Dilaudid by mouth with 8 mm every 3-4 hours as needed which appears to provide enough coverage for her pain issue.
