She presented to [**Hospital6 3426**] for a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe two vessel disease.
The patient does report having some shortness of breath as well as a chronic cough for the last five months and she also has dyspnea on exertion.
She does not have a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
She does report that she does have some loose stools but denies any melena.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Congestive heart failure.

Diabetic neuropathy.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Her mother did have coronary artery disease.
ALLERGIES:   She is allergic to penicillin.
Thyrolar or Liotrix which is two tablets once a day.
EKG shows atrial fibrillation at a rate of 100; some ST elevation in her inferior leads.
An EKG from the 19th showed a sinus rate [**Company 53889**] wave in III and ST depressions in III, AVL and AVS.
Chest x-ray shows diffuse alveolar infiltrates consistent with congestive heart failure.
Carotid ultrasound showed stenosis of the right carotid artery of 46% and the left 50 to 70%.
Her abdomen is obese with normoactive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.
Her carotids are with no bruits.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery Service in preparation of having a coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
Because of her reportedly low outside hematocrit of 25.5, she was re-evaluated here and had a hematocrit originally of 35.0 but other preoperative values were lower.
There was no evidence of any hemolysis or any acute reason for her low hematocrit.
Cardiovascularly, the patient remained in atrial fibrillation for most of her admission, although she was well rate controlled for most of it.
On postoperative day three, the patient had a bradycardic episode down to a heart rate of 30.
However, this episode of bradycardia did delay the removal of pacer wires.
After it was seen that she did not become bradycardic and did not require pacing, the wires were discontinued on postoperative day five.
Respiratory:  There were no major issues during this admission.
Endocrine:  The patient had diabetes mellitus for which she was controlled with Glyburide and her insulin sliding scale.
On the 2nd, the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
Her heart rate was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Her abdomen was still obese but nontender and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
