Pt had recently been admitted in [**6-12**] for cardiac stenting for 100% stenosis of RCA using BMS.
On [**7-17**], pt admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] and underwent Right thoracotomy with esophagectomy and J-tube placement, complicated by SBO thought due to stricture at duodonal anastamosis.

[**2113-8-28**] CXR: In combination with findings of the CT of [**2113-8-19**], the observed lung abnormalties probably represent a combination of pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia.
[**2113-8-28**] CXR: Following removal of right-sided chest tube, there is no visible right pneumothorax and no substantial change in a moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
[**2113-8-28**] CXR: Satisfactory appearances after insertion of new right chest drain with persistence of right apical pneumothorax, moderate right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
[**2113-8-28**] CXR: Satisfactory appearances after insertion of new right chest drain with persistence of right apical pneumothorax, moderate right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
Many groups of bronchial epithelial cells, some with crowding and prominent nucleoli, favor reactive; pulmonary macrophages, neutrophils, and some squamous cells.
Subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall has increased substantially over 12 hours.
Moderate right pleural effusion may be slightly larger and moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.
Right apical pleural tubes are unchanged in their respective positions, and there is no pneumothorax in the upper chest.

There is no evident pneumothorax.
Right subcutaneous emphysema is stable.
Moderate pulmonary edema has minimally improved.
Large air collection in the abdomen still is concerning for pneumoperitoneum.
Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right are unchanged, could be due to atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded.
Subcutaneous air as well as air within the pleural space are partially imaged.
There is no change in multiple opacities, in particular involving the left perihilar and bibasal areas.
Right apical chest tubes remain in place.
