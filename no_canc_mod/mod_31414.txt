Partially imaged moderate right and small left pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.
Cardiomegaly, in conjunction with diffuse subcutaneous edema and mesenteric haziness suggests volume overload.
2 to 3 small fluid density rounded structures along the inferior medial border of the right lobe of the liver, of unclear etiology.
Extensive colonic diverticulosis, without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Interval development of moderate-to-large right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
Persistent cardiomegaly.
No overt pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief, this is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female who was transferred from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab to the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of hypotension, hypoxia, and acute on chronic kidney injury secondary to urosepsis.
She was admitted to the MICU and despite pressor support, fluid resuscitation, and appropriate antibiotics, it soon became clear that the patient's clinical status would not recover as evidenced by increasing lactate and worsening acidemia.
UTI with sepsis is the most likely source.
Levophed was changed to phenylephrine out of concern for tachycardia.
Her daughter, [**Name (NI) 2951**], was informed of her worsening clinical prognosis and it was decided to change to patient's code status to CMO.
Acute on Chronic Renal Faillure:  Cr was initially 4, up from baseline of 1.
Thought to be [**3-10**] ischemic ATN in the setting of septic shock.
Likely [**3-10**] to septic shock.
