An area of heaped-up and friable mucosa with a central eschar but no obvious ulceration was noted in the fundus.
This lesion may be malignant but could also represent severe localized inflammation.
There was a significant amount of retained food in the fundus but no fresh or old blood.
Given the concern for acute esophageal necrosis and retained food in the stomach, the decision was made to abort the procedure.
KUB [**2120-1-28**]: A hiatus hernia is present and gas is seen within the herniated stomach.
No evidence of dilated bowel is otherwise seen.
No evidence of gastric volvulus.
Degenerative changes are noted within the lumbar spine.
Herniation of the stomach into the thoracic cavity; somewhat it takes a tortuous course within the thorax but does not exhibit signs of volvulus.
Hepatic cysts.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Large hiatal hernia with adjacent atelectasis.
No free air under the diaphragms.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 89 F with history of HTN and gastric ulcers who presented  with coffee-ground emesis in the setting of nausea, and was found on EGD to have a black esophagus and inability to pass the scope distally secondary to a significant hiatal hernia.
She underwent EGD the following morning, which showed diffuse esophagitis with patches of black discoloration and overlying exudate suggestive of necrosis, as well as an area of heaped-up and friable mucosa with a central eschar in the fundus.
A gastric volvulus was suspected, though was not detected on follow up  CT abdomen the following day.
She tolerated advancement of her diet without nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
While a definitive diagnosis of her blackened esophageal mucosa was not obtained, it was felt to be possibly hemorrhagic from her severe hiatal hernia causing intermittent volvulus or obstruction.
The minimally-invasive surgery team was consulted as the patient became more amenable to intervention, and felt that a correction of the hiatal hernia would be non-emergent though appropriately managed in the outpatient setting after undergoing repeat EGD to definitively establish a diagnosis of her friable fundus mucosa and eschar via biopsy.
HYPERTENSION:  her antihypertensives were initially held given concern for upper GI bleed.
PENDING LABS AT DISCHARGE: None  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: - Will need repeat EGD as an outpatient to establish diagnosis of esophageal and gastric abnormalities - Will need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] following repeat EGD.
You underwent an endoscopy which revealed likely dark bleeding and poor blood flow to the esophagus, and a mass-like object in your stomach which may represent a compression of the stomach by a hiatal hernia.
