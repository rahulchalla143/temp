There is no further description of the headache features in EMS or OSH notes.
She had an episode of "LEFT arm contracture" with her RIGHT arm "pushing outward" and both feet "pointing away" as per [**Hospital1 **] note (at 13:00).
Afterward, she was noted to have left sided weakness and a left facial droop.
She received a CT CNS w/o contrast that showed a LEFT fronto-parietal avm without evidence of a bleed.

MRI/A head and neck: prelim  MRI: Some foci of restricted diffusion in R frontal lobe, consistent with acute infarct.
No large territorial infarct, likely due to collateral vasculature.
Limited evaluation of ischemia without perfusion study.
High-level R common carotid stenosis at takeoff from R brachiocephalic, but is partially patent until bifurcation.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 yo RHW with HTN, HL, Asthma and radiculopathy who presented to OSH via an unclear history, concerning for seizure and was found to have a large L sided AVM, R carotid occlusion from brachicephalic up to siphon and two small acute infarction in frontal and parietal lobes of right hemisphere.
There was no evidence of hemorrhage on CT or MRI.
NEURO: It was felt that her inciting event was related to a seizure due to a large AVM.
Right carotid occlusion was felt to be chronic in nature given collateral filling, though a definitive determination could not be made.
The stroke was felt to be either due to stump emboli or due to watershed type infarctions in setting of seizure and possible hypotension or cerebral ischemia from a steal due to a large AVM.
She was started Keppra 750mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure ppx, as EEG was notable for a left temporal spike.
CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient had isolated troponin elevation without any changes on her EKG and CKMB within normal limits.
ID: The patient had an Elevated WBC to 12K with PMN predominance.
There where no active signs of infection (negative UA and CXR [Left perihilar streaky opacities consistent with atelectasis]).
The patinet had no fevers and no further investigation was completed.
The patient may benefit from medication for glucose intolerance.
Outpatient Physical Therapy Therapy post right MCA stroke with slight residual left sided weakness.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Large left AVM Right frontal ischemic stroke; likely thromboembolic Hypertension Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: The patient was hemodynamically stable.
Exam was without any focal neurological deficits with the exception of slight left sided weakness at the deltoid and IP.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation of left sided weakness and a possible seizure.
You were found to have a condition known as an AVM (arterial venous malformation).
In addition you were found to have a stroke.
