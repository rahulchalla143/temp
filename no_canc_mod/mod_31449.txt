Per his wife, he developed non-productive cough yesterday with increasing wheezing and chest tightness.
No GI or GU symtpoms.
No sick contacts or travel, no fever chills sweats.
Per OSH records, patient got epinephrine, atropine, and peripheral dopamine.
Sent to an OSH, found to be in sinus tachycardia in 110's sats in low 90's on 100%.
CTA chest with multifocal pneumonia without PE.
Past Medical History: DM Asthma vs COPD hospitalized [**9-24**] requiring MICU stay and BiPAP.

EKG SR @97, right axis, J point elevation V1-V2 with peaked T's in V2-V3, STD with TWI in II,III,vF with small q's.
Imaging CXR Multifocal consolidations consistent with aspiration versus multifocal pneumonia.
CTA chest PFI: No evidence of PE.
Severe multi-focal pneumonia, with [**Male First Name (un) 239**]-in-tree appearance.
Multiple small lung nodules.
Recommend repeat CT chest after medical treatment of pneumonia in order to rule out malignancy.
Severe coronary disease.
Severe spine deformity.
CT head diffuse hypodensity of the cerebellum with mass effect on the fourth ventricle and braintem is concerning for stroke.
no hemorrhage.
Repeat CT head:  FINDINGS: There is new global effacement of sulci consistent with global cerebral edema.
There is new effacement of the quadrigeminal and suprasellar cisterns consistent with transtentorial herniation.
There is new noncommunicating hydrocephalus with symmetric dilatation of the lateral and third ventricle with effacement of the fourth ventricle.
Concern for tonsillar herniation is present with crowding at the foramen magnum, not well evaluated on CT given beam hardening artifact in this region.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage.
Increased opacification of the sphenoid sinuses likely relate to intubation.
New global cerebral edema with new effacement of the suprasellar and quadrigeminal cisterns consistent with component of herniation.
New noncommunicating hydrocephalus.
Crowding of the foramen magnum is concerning for tonsillar herniation.
However, evaluation is limited given beam hardening artifact in this region.
Cervical spondylosis.
Diffuse segmentational abnormality involving upper thoracic spine.
Labs on Admission: 25.9>47.1<462 N 73 band 6 L 3 M 12 E 0 Baso 0 Atyp 5 Metas 1 CK 255 MB 5 Tropn 0.02 Chem 134/7.0/95/26/34/1.7<389 Lactate 3.7 ABG 7.14/74/99/27  Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old man with DM and asthma who presented following a cardiopulmonary arrest at home.
PEA arrest:  Secondary to hypoxia or acidosis.
The patient had evidence of anoxic brain injury by CT scan from [**2112-11-18**] and repeat CT of the head on [**2111-11-20**] showed evidence of tonsilar herniation.
Neurology was consulted and conducted EEG which showed no brain wave activity.
After an indepth discussion with the patient's family, the decision was made to make the patient CMO and withdraw care considering his brain death secondary to cardiac arrest.
Hypotension:  Likely was secondary to arrest or underlying sepsis, remained pressor dependent during course.
Pt had elevated white blood cell count on admission, however on steroids.
[**Month (only) 116**] have had underlying pneumonia as cause of COPD exacerbation with element of sepsis.
Respiratory failure:  Probably secondary to pneumonia versus COPD exacerbation.
Imaging consistent with multifocal pna.
PPX heparin SQ, protonix, mouthcare, head of bed elevations .
After the patient was determined to have significant anoxic brain injury secondary to cardiac arrest, the patient was taken off pressor and ventilatory support.
