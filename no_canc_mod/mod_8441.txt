M with AIDS (CD4 65 on [**2119-10-31**]), hepatitis C cirrhosis, recently discharged on [**10-14**] after a five day admission for abdominal pain, worsening ascites, jaundice and diarrhea, now presents with fever, and abdominal pain.
The patient mentions that 1 week ago he started having diarrhea with dark stools.
About 3 days ago, he had worsening abdominal pain and chills.
He has had poor po intake over the past 3 days secondary to nausea and vomiting.
Patient denies any cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain.
He was found to have diffuse abdominal tenderness, and brown, guaiac positive stool.
Abdominal paracentesis was attempted twice, however was stopped due to bleeding.
He received levofloxacin 750 mg, vancomycin 1 g empirically for community acquired pneumonia, with flagyl for abdominal coverage, and bactrim.
On evaluation in the ICU, the patient has some mild abdominal pain and weakness, but no other complaints.
(CD4 65, VL<48 [**2119-10-31**]) 2) h/o heart murmur since childhood 3) Bronchospastic lung disease 4) Bipolar disorder 5) OSA 6) Hepatitis C, diagnosed in [**2113**] (Genotype 4).
He has never been on therapy for this due to his psychiatric problems.
7) h/o E. coli bacteremia in [**2114**], with no identified source 8) Appendicitis in [**2116**], managed medically with antibiotics 9) Clostridium difficile colitis [**11/2117**] 10) GERD 11) h/o polysubstance abuse - heroin & EtOH 12) Cirrhosis - pt reports diagnosed 1 year ago thought [**2-6**] Hep C. Denies being followed by GI/liver specialist.
13) h/o candidal esophagitis [**2107**] 14) s/p treatment for TB.
No rebound or guarding.
Diffuse bowel wall thickening of the ascending and transverse colon, appearing similar to CT from [**10-10**].
Cirrhosis with large volume ascites.
Hematocrit level in the pelvic ascites suggests a component of blood in the fluid - possibly secondary to traumatic paracentesis?
Position of the left internal jugular central venous line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3234**] is a 42 year old man with AIDS and HCV with decompensated cirrhosis who presented on [**11-6**] with fevers and abdominal pain with hypotension requiring ICU admission.
* Goal of care Given the patient's end stage liver disease and advanced AIDS, the palliative care service was consulted.
* Hypotension Likely due to volume depletion and possible sepsis.
* Fever, possible SBP Patient underwent a therapeutic paracentesis complicated by bleeding (Hct 8%).
A component of SBP could not be absolutely excluded therefore he was treated empirically with ceftriaxone.
CMV assay showed detectable virus, but at a very low level (<600 copies, below limits of assay to quantify) and was felt to most likely be a false positive.
* AIDS Patient had supressed viral load, with poor immunologic recovery.
After being made CMO, his antiretrovirals and prophylactic antimicrobials were discontinued.
He may undergo therapeutic paracentesis if required for symptomatic relief with his large ascites.
* Acute renal failure Likely pre-renal on presentation, with ATN in setting of hypotension.
With his tense ascites abdominal compartment syndrome was a consideration, as was hepatorenal syndrome given possible SBP.
