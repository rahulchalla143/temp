Slight increase in bronchovascular markings bilaterally, but no evidence of gross consolidation.
Fifth and sixth left anterior rib fractures, which appear old healed fractures; however, no comparison is available to determine acuity.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 45 year old female with a history of alcohol abuse who presents with complaints of palpitations/shortness of breath, found to be in atiral fibrillation.
# Atrial Fibrillation: The patinet with AF w/ RVR but hemodynamically stable.
Symptoms of SOB, palpitations, and tingling likely caused by AF.
In consideration of trigger, no evidence of pneumonia on CXR or systemic infection.
EKG shows some evidence of right heart strain, overall low concern for PE.
Patient recieved amioderone in ED, but EKG shows no evidence of pre-excitiation in narrow complext SVT.
Considered lone AF without need for further evaluation or treatment.
# Alcoholism: No history of seizures or DTs, and recently underwent withdrawl on CIWA taper without significant difficulties.
# Anion-Gap metabolic acidosis: Patient with ketones in urine, and likely contributing source.
Has not eaten for 3 days, so likely ketabolic metabolism at play.
Lactate potentiall elevated as well.
No e/o systemic infection, no elevated BG.
# Elevated LFTs: Minor elevations consistent with heavy EtOH use.
Atrial Fibrilation with Rapid Ventricular Response 2.
You were admitted with atrial fibrillation and a rapid heart rate.
You were treated with medications to control your heart rate as well as medications to treat the symptoms of withdrawal from alcohol.
Your atrial fibrillation and rapid heart rate resolved on their own and were most likely related to alcohol intake.
