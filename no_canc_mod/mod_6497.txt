Patient denies any fevers, chills or cough.
He denies any nausea, diaphoresis, vomitting or abdominal pain.
However, the patient did have some tachypnea in the ED, and was admitted to MICU for further observation of respiratory status.
Given leukocytosis and possible infiltrate on chest x-ray, he was also started on cefriaxone and azithromycin for pneumonia.

The renal parenchymal thickness and echogenicity are normal without evidence of calculi or hydronephrosis.
No evidence of hydronephrosis, renal calculi, or solid masses; 2.
Bilateral small renal cysts.
[**2132-8-4**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - FINDINGS: There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with left pleural thickening.
There has been interval decrease in pulmonary interstitial markings when compared to prior exam.
A more nodular density measuring approximately 1 cm is noted in the right lung base which was not seen on prior exam and may represent the nipple.
IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in interstitial pulmonary markings.
Interval development of right basilar atelectasis.
EKG: === [**2132-8-4**] - Sinus rhythm with atrial premature complexes; Consider left atrial abnormality; Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes; Since previous tracing of [**2132-8-3**], no significant change.

of LLL infiltrate on CXR, the patient was initially treated as asthma exacerbation precipitated by pneumonia.
On HD2 the patient was clinically improved, denied SOB and was weaned off O2.
During his stay the patient remained without wheezes on exam and it was noted that LLL opacity was unchanged from prior x-ray several years ago.
He was also ruled out for MI w/EKGs and cardiac enzymes.
He was discovered to have a history of esophageal spasm and this was felt to be a more likely explanation for the chest tightness.
# Urethral Stricture:  Patient with h/o BPH s/p multpile urological procedures, including s/p Suprapubic prostatectomy.
Urology was consulted, performed a flexible cystoscopy in the ICU and found severe urethral stricture.
The patient leaked around the catheter, the catheter eventually came out but he continued to have good urine output and post-void bladder scans were performed q4h to ensure he did not have high residual volume.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine 1.3-1.6 baseline and up to 1.8 at presentation.
# Diabetes mellitus - On admission the home Glipizide but this was discontinued and blood sugars covered with SSI and a diabetic diet was prescribed.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital chest tightness, some difficulty breathing and a fast heart rate.
Testing showed that you did NOT have a heart attack.
We have also scheduled you to have some breathing tests to more closely diagnosis the periodic breathing problems that you experience.
Please call your Primary Care Provider [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/or come back to the Emergency Room if you experience any of the following: trouble breathing that does not go away with the use of your inhalers, temperature > 101.6, shaking chills, chest pain or pressure, pain that is not relieved with medicines, inability to pass your urine, changes in mental status, uncontrolled nausea/vomitting, finger sticks at home that are over 400 mg/dl, blood in your stool or any other health related concerns.
Take Trazodone as needed at bedtime if you have trouble sleeping.
We have also started you on a baby Aspirin [**Name2 (NI) 24073**] to help prevent heart attacks and a medicine called Omeprazole to help prevent acid reflux.
