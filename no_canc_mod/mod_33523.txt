She was then brought to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital where CT head revealed R subdural bleed.
She received Dilantin IV and the organ bank was contact[**Name (NI) **] for possible organ donation since the patient was an organ donor.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Atrial fibrillation Hyperlipidemia Throat cancer Kidney cancer  Social History: NC  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: vitals T 98.6 BP 133/83 AR RR 17 O2 sat 99% Gen: Patient not responsive to sternal command HEENT: ETT in place, pupils not reactive to light Heart: Irreg, irreg, no audible m,r,g Lungs: CTAB Abdomen: Soft, NT/ND, +BS Extremities: No LE edema, 1+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally Neuro: Absent corneal and pupillary reflexes.
+Babinski reflex, withdraws lower extremities to stimulation  Pertinent Results: CT head ([**5-2**]): Massive subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage with severe mass effect and subfalcine, downward transtentorial, uncal and cerebellar herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74yo female with atrial fibrillation on Plavix and Coumadin who is being transferred to the MICU for management of massive R subdural bleed.
1)Right subdural hematoma: Patient transferred from OSH for massive R SDH s/p fall in the setting of being on Coumadin and Plavix.
Neurosurgery evaluated her in the ED and felt that she had no brainstem function.
On our exam, she is breathing over the vent and she has a positive babinski and withdraws her lower extremities to stimulation.
Despite this, given the severity of this event she will likely have very poor neurological function and will unlikely recover to baseline functioning.
