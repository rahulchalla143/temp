The pain changes location and is not associated with shortness of breath; although, it is associated with an increase in fatigue and decreased oral intake.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to have an irregular rhythm.
The patient remained completely asymptomatic during these episodes without complaints of chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath.
Coronary artery disease.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus; complicated by peripheral neuropathy.
History of transient ischemic attacks.
History of colonic polyps.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Multiple electrocardiograms obtained in the Emergency Department showed bradycardia with a rate in the 30s and a pattern consistent with atrial bigeminy with blocked APBs as well as episodes of atrial fibrillation and episodes of typical atrial flutter with a heart rate in the 150s.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for close monitoring due to his irregular rhythm and intermittent hypotension.
However, it was decided since he did have episodes of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter that he would be amiodarone loaded and started on Coumadin.
The patient was started on Coumadin following a Physical Therapy evaluation which showed very minimal fall risk.
The patient's creatinine, which was elevated at 1.4 on admission, decreased back down to his baseline with some hydration.
Prior to discharge, the patient was also started on a low dose of Toprol-XL due to his history of coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
Atrial flutter.
Coronary artery disease.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
