No evidence of aneurysm larger than 2 mm, with no evidence of either diffuse or focal vasospasm.
Tubular hyperattenuating structure traversing the right sylvian fissure and perisylvian region, extending up to the vertex, which could represent cortical vein thrombosis, related to the SAH, above; however, on CTA, the regional cortical veins and principal dural venous sinuses appear patent, noting that the study is not specifically designed to evaluate the venous system.
In the absence of proven venous thrombosis, this finding likely represents clotted subarachnoid blood in an unusual configuration.
