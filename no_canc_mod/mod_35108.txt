Thickening and inflammatory stranding surrounding the cecum and proximal ascending colon is most consistent with an infectious colitis, especially given the patient's history of immune deficiency.
Multiple venous collaterals in the subcutaneous tissues, likely related to central venous stenosis or occlusion, presumably related to the patient's reported history of multiple central lines and tunneled venous catheters.
[**3-26**] CXR: PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-22**]:  Small region of heterogeneous parenchymal abnormality in the right lower lobe medial basal segment looks more like scarring than pneumonia but could be pneumonia.
There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.
The massive distention of the azygous vein as well as dilatation of the upper mediastinum securing the aortic knob are both explained by dilated venous collaterals.
No pleural effusion.
Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities and centrilobular nodules with tree-in-[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 239**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 81343**] suggest acute infection .
Part of the ground glass opacities might be explained by expiratory character of the images.
The findings are atypical for bacterial or fungal infection and viral or mycoplasma etiologies are considered more likely.
Extensive calcified thrombus within the left brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava presumably from prior indwelling hemodialysis catheter.
Sclerotic appearance of the skeleton is probably related to renal disease.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Global left ventricular function is probably normal, but a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
EEG [**4-7**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The background activity was mostly of high voltage and in the low theta and delta frequency ranges, seen either in a generalized distribution or more pronounced over the left hemisphere; sometimes similar lower voltage activity was seen.
These findings are most consistent with an encephalopathy.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**4-5**] SCAN FINDINGS: There are focal areas of FLAIR signal hyperintensities within the bilateral frontal subcortical white matter.
These are likely secondary to chronic subcortical infarctions.
There is no evidence of diffusion restriction to suggest acute infarction or abscess.
There is mild prominence of the cerebral sulci, inappropriate for age likely representing mild cerebral atrophy.
There is also prominence of the cerebellar fovea inappropriate for age consistent with mild cerebellar atrophy.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass lesion.
Minimal mucosal thickening is present within the right sphenoid sinus.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral frontal subcortical FLAIR hyperintensities likely due to chronic sub-cortical infarctions.
Mild cerebellar atrophy.
[**4-5**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The presence of extensive collateral veins in the chest, seen in the prior study, significantly limits the diagnostic value for pulmonary embolus.
For example, the majority of the administered IV contrast refluxes into the azygos and hemiazygos veins as well as extensive collateral lumbar veins.
Given these limitations, there is no evidence of large, central pulmonary embolus.
A new left lower lobe pneumonia is identified likely contributory to reported respiratory status.
There is impaction of the left lower lobe bronchus (2:47, 48; 301B:33).
The previously seen diffuse ground- glass opacities or focal peribronchial opacities are again consistent with an infectious process, now seen to a lesser extent in the right upper/middle lobes.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.
Pericardial calcifications are again seen, and there is extensive calcification of the coronary arteries, especially the left anterior descending coronary artery.
Extensive collateral vessels are seen again in the chest, likely due to prior instrumentation.
A left pleural calcification is again seen (4:5).
The bowel is collapsed, and there is no evidence of obstruction.
There is no intra-abdominal free air or fluid.
Scattered mesenteric nodes do not meet pathologic size criteria.
There is apparent decrease in degree of inflammatory fat stranding surrounding the cecum and proximal ascending colon, thought previously infectious in etiology.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Following 180-second delay, pelvic venous opacification is adequate, and there is no evidence of thrombosis.
Osseous structures demonstrate sclerotic skeletal changes and vertebral endplate changes which may relate to end- stage renal disease.
New left lower lobe pneumonia.
Right upper/middle lobe likely infectious airspace opacities improved but not totally resolved.
Suboptimal study for PE given extensive collaterals, but no evidence of large/central PE.
Chronic-appearing thrombus in the left brachiocephalic and superior vena cava  4.
Severe coronary artery calcifications due to end-stage renal disease.
[**4-3**] CT Head NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute large vascular territory infarction.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation is preserved, although there are multiple small foci of hypoattenuation seen in the deep white matter.
These appear chronic, with no surrounding edema or mass effect, although their etiology is unclear.
The osseous structures are normal, with no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
There is mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus.
No acute intracranial process, including no hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
Multiple white matter hypodensities are likely chronic but of uncertain etiology.
Mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus and opacification of the mastoid air cells.
Brief Hospital Course: 22yo F with asthma COPD with stable hypoxia, ESRD on HD, CVID p/w AMS with delirium responsive to HD, now resolved.
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU [**3-23**] for concern of colitis as patient was hypotensive.
Patient was subsequently transferred to the MICU and worked up for altered mental status.
Additionally, patient had a sleep study and was started on BiPap, as she was found to be hypercarbic likely secondary to obesity hypoventilation.
Her oxygen requirements were increasing between [**3-/2125**] and [**4-3**] and was found to have a LLL pneumonia.
She had a full neurological work-up, and it was unrevealing as what caused her state.
The cause of her altered mental status is unclear, but is currently attributed to either her prior psychotropic medications and/or delirum from pneumonia.
Given new fever perhaps this could be hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of pulmonary infection or chemical pneumonitis after emesis earlier during the day.
Pt likely very hypercarbic at baseline given body habitus and obstructive/restrictive lung disease.
Last PFT in [**9-/2146**]; moderate to severe proportionate decrease in flows and volumes with a strong bronchodilator response.
Features suggestive of poorly controlled asthma associated with obesity related ventillatory restriction.
On [**4-3**], patient had an episode of acute respiratory distress and triggered on the floor for tachypnea.
Due to an A-a gradient on her blood gas, she was started empirically on a heparin gtt given previous history of SVC clot.
[**Hospital 25730**] Hospital Acquired Pneumonia:  Patient had elevated WBC count and increasing oxygen requirement that was diagnosed by CXR on [**2147-4-3**].
# Altered mental status:  Now resolved, patient AO x 3 and mentating well.
It was thought not to be secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
The pscyhiatry service saw her and was considering delirium because of poor orientation.
Because her symptoms could be consistent with absence seizures clinically, EEG was done with no evidence of seizure.
Patient improved, but then on the evening of [**4-3**] was found to be unresponsive by nursing staff and was transferred back to the MICU.
Acyclovir was started empirically to cover for HSV encephalitis given some question of temporal lobe abnormalities on previous EEG, and was continued until [**4-10**] when HSV PCR was negative.
EEG again showed wave forms consistent with encephalopathy, but no seizure activity.
MRI brain was performed and revealed Bilateral frontal subcortical FLAIR hyperintensities likely due to chronic sub-cortical infarctions and mild cerebeallar atrophy.
# Abdominal pain/Colitis:  Resolved.
Patient had a CT scan on admission that showed colitis and was treated with five day course of cipro and flagyl.
Abd pain is resolved.
# Hypotension: Patient was asymptomatic on admission with SBP in 60s.
# SVC clot: Radiographic imaging  and physical exam suggestive of extensive collaterals.
Likely causing partial occlusion of SVC due to multiple lines and DVT.
# Anxiety depression: Patient had a history of anxiety and depression, lives in a group home.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2670**] - Colonial Heights - [**Hospital1 487**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Altered Mental Status, unclear etiology - Anxiety/Depression - Hospital Acquired Pneumonia - Infectious Colitis - Obstructive Sleep Apnea Secondary: CVID ESRD Asthma   Discharge Condition: The patient was discharged hemodynamically stable, afebrile.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of your abdominal pain with nausea.
When you arrived, you had very low blood pressure and were admitted to the ICU because of this.
During your hospital course, you became unresponsive and your mental status was altered.
It is unclear why your mental status was altered, but it is suspected that it is related to your psychiatric medications along with a component of delirum from pneumonia.
