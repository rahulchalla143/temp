Patient transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued trauma care.
LEFT FEMUR, KNEE, TIBIA-FIBULA, AND ANKLE: Comminuted spiral fractures are seen within the mid tibial shaft, with slight posterior displacement of the distal most fracture fragment.
A second fracture traverses the tibial ankle mortise, extending along the metaphysial/epiphysial margin.
A linear lucency through the medial epicondyle is also seen.
Finally, there is a comminuted fracture through the proximal left fibular metadiaphysis with slight lateral angulation but no significant displacement.
Comminuted fracture through the medial epicondyle, and epiphyseal- metaphyseal junction of the left tibia.
Two spiral fractures through the mid tibial diaphysis.
Comminuted fracture of the proximal fibular metadiaphysis.
FINDINGS: Again demonstrated are multiple left-sided facial fractures including left zygomatic, left lateral orbital wall, left lateral maxillary sinus, anterior wall of the left maxillary sinus, orbital floor fracture, and fracture of the lateral wall of the left sphenoid sinus that is adjacent to, but not definitively involving the carotid artery course.
These fractures are accompanied by associated fluid (presumed hemorrhage) that partially opacify the left sphenoid sinus, and left maxillary sinus.
Fat and soft tissue herniation is also present within the large left lateral maxillary sinus defect.
Orbital floor fracture does not show definitive evidence for soft tissue herniation.
IMPRESSION: Multiple left facial fractures as described above.
Sinus tachycardia.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
An intramedullary rod with distal and proximal interlocking screws fixates a segmental tibial shaft fracture.
There is new displacement of the proximal fracture fragments.
There is soft tissue swelling.
Status post ORIF of segmental tibial shaft fracture and medial malleolar fracture.
Orthopedics, Plastics, Ophthalmology were consulted initially because of his injuries.
On further review of films it was decided to take him to the OR for ORIF of his left medial malleolus and placement of a rod in his left tibia.
For his facial fractures he was started on Clindamycin which continued for 5 days.
He remained intubated secondary to poor respiratory effort felt related to pain.
Pain Service was consulted for epidural analgesia and patient was eventually weaned and extubated on POD 2 and was transferred from the Trauma ICU to the floor.
Pain Service continued to follow patient because of his pain control issues.
He was on PCA Dilaudid which was discontinued; Dilaudid subcutaneous injections for emergency breakthrough pain and Neurontin.
Psychiatry was consulted to rule out depression, felt symptoms more likely consistent with Adjustment Disorder and recommended Remeron 15 mg @ hs.
Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted as well and have recommended short term rehab.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 4-6 hours as needed for breakthrough pain.
Hydromorphone 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Injection Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for EMERGENCY breakthrough pain.
