Final Report HISTORY: 47-year-old female with new onset diabetes.
Question pancreatic abnormality.
The visualized pancreas is normal in appearance with no focal abnormalities identified.
There is no free fluid in the abdomen.
Limited visualization of portions of the pancreatic head and tail.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 year old female with history of asthma and nephrolithiasis presenting with hyperglycemia, signifcant lactic acidosis, and laboratory and clinical evidence of hypovolemia.
#Hyperglycemia: Given hyperglycemia in the setting of a ketonemia/ketonuria, gap acidosis and elevated serum osm this most likely represented DKA and thus newly diagnosed diabetes.
Significant hemoconcentration and ARF suggestive pt at least [**5-11**] liters negative.
Her lantus dose was 46 units on discharge and ISS for coverage.
Improved with insulin gtt and fluid resucitation.
Workup for lactic acidosis as below.
# Lactic acidosis - Thought to be secondary to severe hypovolemia in the setting of significant osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia.
No source of infection was found as X ray was clear, UA/urine cx benign.
WBC was elevated, possibly due to reactive leukocytosis and it resolved after lactic acidosis resolved.
# ARF: Likely related to significant hypovolemia.
Cr improved from 1.6 to 0.6 with fluid rescucitation.
# Back/hip pain: Patient presented with back and hip pain that had started 3 weeks prior to admission.
The patient was initially treated with narcotics with little effect.
As the pain improved with gabapentin the pain was thought to be neuropathic in origin.
She was discharged with instructions to increase her dose of gabapentin to 300 TID for better pain control.
# Leukocytosis - Initial WBC 15.0 on hemoconcentrated sample, repeat WBC 18.9.
This was thought to be a reactive process as no source of infection was identified and it resolved without intervention.
# Epigastric pain- likely secondary to stomach upset, vomiting over the past 2 days.
On the medical floor the patient's epigastric pain resolved and she was able to tolerate PO.
# Asthma - Not currently taking any medications, no inhaler use for the past year.
Glucometer Please provide patient with one glucometer for blood glucose testing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Diabetes Peripheral Neuropathy   Discharge Condition: excellent   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with 2-3 days of headaches, nausea and vomiting.
You also had a month long history of excessive thirst and urination, as well as signiifcant pain in your lower back and both legs.
We gave you 8L of fluid and insulin which helped to improve your symptoms and normalize your blood sugars.
You were diagnosed with diabetes and we have started you on an insulin regimen to control your blood sugars, in consultation with the [**Hospital **] clinic.
We believe your leg pain is most likely the result of diabetes' effect on the nerves in your leg, something known as a diabteic neuropathy.
We will continue you on neurontin, a medicine for diabetic neuropathy, as your leg pain has improved during your visit.
We have also made an appointment with an opthamologist as you were having some complaints of blurry vision and diabetes can also affect your vision.
If you develop lightheadedness, weakness, severe headaches or fainting episodes, have someone adminster you some sugar containing food/drink and have them bring you to the hospital.
These symptoms can be caused by taking too much insulin and dropping your blood sugars.
In addition, if you develop worsening leg pain, vision changes, or any other concerning symptoms, please come back to the ED.
