[**1-6**] Upper endoscopy/enteroscopy:  Antral erosions, no focal bleed [**1-6**] Flex Sig:  No source of bleed  Brief Hospital Course: 72yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG x 2 who presents from OSH with NSTEMI.
# Syncope: His transfer to the CCU was initiated because of a syncopal episode.
Possible etiologies included vasovagal episode (he was baring down in the bathroom at the time), arrhythmia given his a-flutter/a-fib and sigificant cardiac history.
He was not confused, and had no evidence of seizure activity.
In the CCU, tele showed a-fib with RVR and was uptitrated to 75 TID of metoprolol tartrate and then initiated on a diltiazem drip.
Of note, his anticoagulation was stopped in-house in the setting of developing LGIB (see below), and was discharged on beta blocker but no coumadin.
# NSTEMI: Pt was first seen at [**Hospital3 4107**] with 2 days of chest pain and was noted to have a positive troponin-I of 2.92.
His troponin-T in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED was 1.05, prior troponins in [**2164**] ranged from 0.05->0.23 in the setting of his renal dysfunction.
His troponins remained elevated in the 1's but his CK decreased and his CK-MB were normal.
He also had renal dysfunction, likely contributing to his poor clearance of troponins.
#LGIB:  Pt noted to have Guaiac positive stools and occasional BRBPR.
Pt had both upper endoscopy and colonoscopy which was only significant for antral erosisons but no obvious source of bleed.
After endoscopy, he had no further signs of bleeding and hct stable at 30-32.
He was noted to be volume overloaded in house requiring diuresis with metolazone and toresemide, along with home dose of spironalactone.
Given the presentation of malaise and myalgias it was thought that he had a viral syndrome.
He had been in a-fib with RVR, with likely poor forward flow.
He had increased crackles on exam and required diuresis with good improvement in his respiratory status.
# CKD: Patient has stage III CKD thought to be secondary to CHF.
Creatinine at baseline on arrival (1.7) and increased likely secondary to poor forward flow to as high as 2.3.
# DM II: He was continued on his home regimen of Lantus [**Hospital1 **] (40qAM, 50qPM) and ISS.
# Depression: Continued on home sertraline   Medications on Admission: Allopurinol 150mg daily Calcitriol 0.25mcg qT,Th,[**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] Calcitriol 0.5mcg qM,W,F Ezetimibe 10mg daily Insulin Aspart sliding scale Insulin Lantus 50u qAM, 40u qPM Levothyroid 224mcg daily Metoprolol Succinate 100mg daily NTG SL Omeprazole 40mg daily Sertraline 100mg daily Simvastatin 80mg daily Torsemide 60mg daily Torsemide 40mg PRN increased edema Vit C 500mg [**Hospital1 **] ASA 81mg daily MVI daily Zinc 220mg daily  [**Hospital1 **] Medications: 1. allopurinol 100 mg Tablet Sig: 1.5 Tablets PO DAILY (Daily).

Outpatient Lab Work Please check Chem-7 and CBC on [**2167-1-9**] and call results to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] thanks   [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  [**Hospital3 **] Diagnosis: Acute on chronic Systolic congestive Heart Failure Atrial Fibrillation Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Upper and Lower GI Bleed Diabetes Mellitus Type 2   [**Hospital3 **] Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
[**Hospital3 **] Instructions: You had chest pain and was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with a heart attack.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and had a fainting episode in the bathroom.
You were in an irregular heart rhythm, atrial fibillation, that was converted to a normal rhythm with an electrical cardioversion.
We started an anticoagulation pill called coumadin to prevent strokes from the atrial fibrillation and you developed a bleed somewhere in your GI tract.
Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] or [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
