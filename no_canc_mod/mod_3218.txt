The patient was ruled out for SBP, blood, urine cultures negative and CXR without infiltrate.
Patient was guaiaic positive without frank bleeding and impression likely source is known portal gastropathy.

Evaluate for biliary dilatation and portal flow.
There is unchanged appearance to a shrunken, nodular, cirrhotic-appearing liver with coarsened echogenicity and mild-to-moderate surrounding ascites.
No intrahepatic mass lesions are identified.
There is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation and the common bile duct measures approximately 0.6 cm.
There is mild gallbladder wall thickening likely related to third spacing but no evidence of choledocholithiasis.
Doppler interrogation of the main portal vein was difficult due to underlying cirrhosis and difficulty with breath holding, but the main portal vein remains patent with appropriate hepatopetal flow.
Mild-to-moderate surrounding ascites.
No intrahepatic ductal dilatation and patent main portal vein with appropriate hepatopetal flow.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2160-2-26**] 7:31 PM CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Reason: Eval for consolidation [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 55 year old man with history of cirrhosis, presents with encephalopathy.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2160-1-29**]: Vague opacification in the left mid lung at the level of the eighth posterior rib is probably due to healing rib fractures at that level and associated pleural thickening.
I see no good evidence for pneumonia.
Heart size is normal, hilar, and mediastinal contours are unremarkable and aside from a left lower lateral pleural surface, which is excluded from the examination, the other pleural margins are normal.
