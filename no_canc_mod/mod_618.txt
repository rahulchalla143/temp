Admission Date: [**2160-3-20**]        Discharge Date: [**2160-4-4**]   Service:  MED  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman with a history of congestive heart failure with the last echocardiogram prior to examination revealing an ejection fraction of 75 percent with 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure, atrial fibrillation, and colon carcinoma status post colectomy presenting with congestive heart failure and anemia.
On admission, the patient reported increased shortness of breath and trouble walking secondary to lower extremity edema for five days prior to admission.
He denied chest pain, fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
Congestive heart failure:  Echocardiogram in [**2159-2-20**] showed mild dilated left atrium with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular function of greater than 75 percent, mild atrial fibrillation, trace aortic insufficiency, and 1+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation along with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Atrial fibrillation anticoagulated on Coumadin.
Pancytopenia, this is most likely secondary to mitral valve stenosis, but the patient has undergone a bone marrow biopsy.
Transient ischemic attacks.
Colon carcinoma status post colectomy.
Cerebrovascular accident.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.4 to 2.7.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy.
II/VI systolic murmur throughout loudest at the right upper sternal border and left lower sternal border.
No dorsalis pedis palpable secondary to extreme edema.
Chest x-ray:  Stable cardiomegaly, pulmonary and axillary distribution consistent with mild congestive heart failure, without pulmonary edema or effusion.
Congestive heart failure - The patient with significantly volume overloaded on admission with severe lower extremity edema from volume overload seen on chest x-ray.
The crackles in the left lobe were improved and the patient had evidence of becoming dry with an increase in creatinine by [**2160-3-25**].
However, on [**2160-3-25**], the patient became hypotensive which continued to be a problem over the next 24 hours.
This was possibly secondary to urosepsis and required large fluid boluses to maintain his blood pressure.
In the setting of this increased intravenous fluid, the patient's congestive heart failure worsened and he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
Coronary artery disease - The patient was found to have a new right bundle branch block on admission.
Laboratory data revealed an elevated MB index and slightly elevated troponin 0.4 to 0.6.
An echocardiogram was repeated to evaluate for new wall defect and provide further ______________ regarding the patient's congestive heart failure.
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal ventricular cavity size.
Mild aortic valve stenosis, periventricular and preventricular, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation 1+, mild pulmonary _____________________.
Atrial fibrillation - The patient is on Coumadin for anticoagulation at home and a beta blocker for rate control.
Infectious disease - The patient showed no evidence of infection on admission.
However, on [**2160-3-25**], he became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 70.
The patient was pancultured and was found to have urosepsis with 10:100,000 of Enterobacter ACA grown on culture.
The patient required transfer to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2160-3-26**] for blood pressure support and diuresis consistent with congestive heart failure.
At this time he is afebrile with a normal white blood cell count.
Renal - The patient had acute and chronic renal failure at the time of presentation.
During admission, he did have an increase in creatinine during which time his Lasix was held.
Myeloid dysplastic syndrome - The patient is pancytopenic at baseline thought to be secondary to myeloid dysplastic syndrome, although this has not been confirmed with a bone marrow biopsy.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease.
Myeloid dysplastic syndrome.
