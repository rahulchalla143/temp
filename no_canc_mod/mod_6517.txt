Prior to presentation, pt had fevers and UTI and was treated with 10 d of levo (completed [**3-11**]).
Initial CXR from [**Last Name (un) 4068**] demonstrated enlarged L pleural effusion.
While at [**Location (un) 620**], had CT chest which demonstrated large pericardial effusion / L pleural effusion.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for diagnostic/therapeutic pericardiocentesis.
Pt has hx of basal cell ca on her nose, that was removed several years ago.
She been having intermittent fevers for months.
20 lb unintentional weight loss in the last month.
Pt has been having mammograms since age 40, last in [**Month (only) **], all wnl.
Has not had colonoscopy since age 48, but no colon ca in family.
CT chest showed no mediastinal or hilar LAD.
Family hx of cancer on both sides.
Past Medical History: Multiple sclerosis (wheelchair bound) History of basal cell ca on her nose, removed  Social History: Former pediatrician.
Baseline resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right sided pressures (RA mean 10 mmHg), normal pulmonary, and normal left sided pressures with a normal cardiac index (3.3 l/min/m2).
TTE [**2169-3-15**] 7 pm: There continues to be a moderate to large pericardial effusion.
No significant change compared to prior.
No evidence of RV collapse in diastole to suggest tamponade.
TTE [**2169-3-15**]: EF 70-75%, 1+MR, 1+TR, large pericardial effusion, question of loculation, echodense, no tamponade, no RV collapse .
CT chest [**2169-3-14**]: No mediastinal or hilar LAD, L left pleural effusion, collapsed LLL, small R effusion, no pneumonia.
VERY LARGE PERICARDIAL EFFUSION, LARGE LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION, AND SMALL RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION.
COMPRESSIVE LEFT LOWER LOBE COLLAPSE SECONDARY TO THE EFFUSION.
NO PNEUMONIA SEEN IN THE VISUALIZED AERATED PORTIONS OF THE LUNGS.
[**3-13**] Blood cx NGTD [**3-14**] Blood cx pend [**3-13**] Urine cx negative   Brief Hospital Course: 48 F with PMH MS (wheelchair bound) presenting with intermittent fevers, pericardial effusion and pleural effusion.
# Pericardial effusion and Cardiac: Differential Dx:  Possibilities for etiology of pericardial and pleural effusion include drug-induced hypersensitivity (increased serum eosinophil count), drug effect (patient was taking copaxone for years and zenapax for 4 months, both of which deviates T cells to a Th2 response, which promotes an eosinophilic response), infection (GPC in broth from pericardial biopsy), and autoimmune disease (unusual presentation of lupus or vasculitis to have isolated effusions).
On admission, a TTE showed a large possibly loculated pericardial effusion (greater posteriorly - 3.5 cm compared with anteriorly - 1.2 cm) that was echodense and consistent with blood, inflammation and cellular elements without evidence of tamponade.
The patient was taken to the cath lab for pericardiocentesis with removal of 220 ml of serosanguinous fluid and placement of a pigtail catheter.
Cytology showed 79% lymphocytes, some activated forms consistent with a reactive process.
Microbiology studies showed no bacterial or fungal growth.
Following pericardiocentesis and drainage, she continued to have a large circumferential pericardial effusion by TTE without signs of tamponade.
CT surgery performed VATS to evacuate the pericardial effusion without complication.
Pericardial biopsy showed Gram positive cocci only growing in broth, which may be contamination.
Biopsy showed lymphocytes, degranulating eosinophils, and a few scattered PMNs.
Tissue culture needs to be followed after discharge, although the effusion is unlikely to be caused by a bacterial infection because the patient has clinically been asymptomatic other than fevers.
# Pleural effusion: Pt has had fevers and 20 lb weight loss over the last several weeks.
To evaluate for a source of possible malignancy and L pleural effusion seen on CXR, she was sent for a CT with IV and oral contrast following the pericardiocentesis which showed a large left pleural exudative effusion, small right pleural effusion, indeterminant 1.4-cm adrenal nodule, dilated common duct measuring 7-8 mm with no obvious obstructing source.
The L pleural effusion was tapped 1L by interventional pulmonology, revealing straw-colored, clear fluid.
There was no pus noted in the pericardial or pleural fluid.
Fevers up to 103 were intermittent, and patient would spike once a day and then remain afebrile for the remainder of the day.
# Multiple sclerosis: Patient was advised to follow up with her neurologist and stop taking Copaxone (glatiramer) HS and Zenapax for life.
# Osteoporosis: Fosamax and Ca carb were held during admission, but may be continued after discharge.
# Anxiety: Paxil and Zyprexa prn were continued during admission.
Pt has no chest pain, no SOB, satting 95% RA.
Discharge Instructions: Do not continue your copaxone or Zenapax before discussing your pericardial and pleural effusion with your oncologist to see if these might be side effects from these drugs.
