He had electrocardiogram changes, and so was sent to arrival, he noted that his pain was similar to his previous angina.
this pain/pressure radiated to both his arms and was not associated with nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or dyspnea.
In the Emergency Department of [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for catheterization with possible intervention given the ST changes on his electrocardiogram; namely, ST depressions in leads II and aVL, and ST elevations in II, III, and aVF.
He was pain free on arrival here and was taken to the catheterization laboratory via Med-Flight.
He had an episode of transient hypotension in the catheterization laboratory, and so was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for monitoring.
Coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction in [**2112**]; at which time a catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 55% with an 80% right coronary artery lesion, a 90% left anterior descending artery lesion that was stented, and a 90% first obtuse marginal lesion that was angioplastied.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   His father died of coronary artery disease.
No calcium or cocaine use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed a middle-aged man in no acute distress who was pain free and afebrile.
His lungs were clear with no rales.
He had no jugular venous distention.
His heart was regular with distant heart sounds and no appreciable murmurs.
His extremities were warm and with no edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   His catheterization revealed a 90% left circumflex lesion that was stented, an 80% stenosis of his first obtuse marginal that was stented, a 40% mid left anterior descending artery lesion, and an 80% mid right coronary artery lesion.
He also had mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with a pulmonary artery pressure of 33/22.
He had mild increased left-sided filling pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18.
He had T wave flattening in V1.
He had 1-mm ST depressions in V1 and V2.
He had 2-mm ST depressions in aVL.
He had ST elevations in II, III, and aVF.
There was no fascicular block.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 17437**] did well in the Coronary Care Unit with no further episodes of hypotension.
He had no recurrent chest pain, or shortness of breath, or arrhythmias noted on telemetry.
was started with no further decrease in his blood pressure.
He had a normal left atrial and left ventricular size.
He had mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
He had basal and mid inferior hypokinesis.
There was no pericardial effusion.
Coronary artery disease, status post acute inferior posterior myocardial infarction.
