Admission Date:  [**2190-1-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2190-2-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2125-8-26**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old African American woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and asthma who was recently admitted to the [**Hospital6 256**] from [**2189-12-25**] to [**2189-12-26**] with presyncope felt to be posturally related.
She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction on that admission, however, she had new T wave inversions in L4 and L5.
She did well until [**2190-1-6**] when she was seen by her Primary Care Physician who reported another episode of lightheadedness that also seemed to be postural.
Her lightheadedness resolved but subsequently had asthma exacerbations status post steroid course.
On the echocardiogram she was shown to have a dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40 percent.
Posterior/inferior/apical akinesis, lateral hypokinesis and large thrombus in the left ventricle.
No focal weakness.
No recent headache.
No lightheadedness over the past several days.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has diabetes mellitus which is relatively well controlled off medications, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and asthma.
Also, cholelithiasis and lower back pain.
Dry mucous membranes.
No appreciable bruits.
No elevations in jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
No organomegaly.
No femoral bruits.
Her chest x-ray showed no evidence of focal consolidation, flattened diaphragms and hyperinflation of the lungs bilaterally.
Her head CT showed no definite evidence of acute intracranial bleed.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 71 with normal axis T waves inversions in V4 through V6.
ST flattening in the limb leads.
She is a 65 year old woman with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and asthma with recent admission for presyncope found to have a depressed systolic ejection fraction on echocardiogram as well as a large left ventricular thrombus.
In the setting of her recent electrocardiogram changes and echocardiogram, the patient was ruled out for an myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes.
She was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory to assess her reason for a fall in her left ventricular function since she has never had chest pain and to risk stratify her for coronary artery disease.
Her cardiac catheterization showed three vessel coronary artery disease with an angiographically normal LMCA.
The left anterior descending had 60 percent mid vessel stenosis, mid to distal 90 percent diffuse stenosis involving the origin of the major diag branch which also has a difficult 90 percent stenosis.
The left circumflex had a 70 percent mid vessel lesion and a 90 percent distal lesion in the setting of diffuse disease and the inferior branches a large OM1 had diffuse 90 percent lesion.
The right coronary artery had mild diffuse disease with a 60 percent mid vessel stenosis.
No other intervention was performed at the time since the patient was thought to be more suitable for coronary artery bypass graft.
Work up was performed to rule out any carotid disease, however, during the process of the work up the patient was found to have a severe right internal carotid artery stenosis estimated to be 80 to 90 percent reduction in luminal diameter.
A follow up MRI/MRA of the head and neck were completed which confirmed the right high grade stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
Also, there was an area of elevated T2 signal within the right occipital lobe.
The hyperintensity also involved the cortex and subcortical white matter.
There was also a 5 mm focus of elevated T2 signal within the right periatrial white matter.
The findings were most consistent with subacute or chronic infarcts.
The patient subsequently went to the CCU postoperatively but did not have any complication.
Her goal INR should be between 2.5 and 3 as per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for her left ventricular clot.
In terms of her next issue which is her hypertension, she was started on a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor.
Her diabetes mellitus and glucose was well controlled, not needing much Insulin at all during her course of hospitalization.
She had a right internal carotid artery stenosis, status post right internal carotid artery stent.
Type II diabetes mellitus, diet controlled.
