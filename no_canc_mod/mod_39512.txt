Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 91997**] was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery team and transferred to the  Trauma ICU for close monitoring which included hourly neuro checks.
Repeat CT head imaging in the next day showed resolution of the right SDH indicating it was likely artifact rather than a real lesion.
His occipital condyle fracture was managed non-operatively and he is recommended to be in a hard cervical collar for at least six weeks.
His clavicle fracture was evaluated by orthopedics and was nonoperative - he will wear a sling and non weight bear on the left arm.
On HD 2 he was AAOx3 and with stable imaging no longer requiring frequent neuro checks and was transferred to the floor.
He did experience intermittent nausea which appeared to be associated with Dilaudid.
Once these were stopped the nausea resolved and his pain was well controlled on prn Oxycodone Ultram and Tylenol standing.
