CXR:  no acute cardiopulmonary process ECG:  85bpm, nsr, nml intervals, nml axis, no st/t changes  [**2154-1-28**] RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 11.0 cm.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, masses or stones.
A Foley catheter is identified within a decompressed bladder  Brief Hospital Course: 43 year-old woman with h/o CAD s/p MI [**2141**], CHF with diastolic dysfunction, TIDM c/b gastroparesis, [**Year (4 digits) **]/scleroderma, restrictive lung disease, Gerd, s/p retinal hemorrhage [**2154-1-26**], presents today with decreased urine output, increased LE edema, shortness of breath, mental status changes, and chest burning.
Laboratory analysis suggestive of ARF on CRI.
ARF:  Patient with CRI, baseline creatinine around 2.2, but very labile, presented with creatinine 6.5.
Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis.
FENA 0.8% suggestive of prerenal azotemia.
Renal consulted, spun urine with no sediment noted.
Etiology thought to be prerenal secondary to hypovolemia with diarrhea.
Initial presentation concerning for uremia given fluid overload, rash, asterixis on exam, but creatinine improved to 4.8 by day #2 and patient did not want hemodialysis and her electrolytes were stable.
Hypotension:  likely due to hypovolemia, intravascular depletion as pressure responded well to IVFs.
No evidence of infection or other source of sepsis.
Beta-blocker resumed as blood pressure came up and as she has diastolic failure.
Mental status changes:  ddx: uremia as described above vs hypoglycemia as pt reports baseline bl sugar 180s and symptoms develop with bl sugar 80, presented to ED with bl glucose 108.
4.  ?
PNA vs viral syndrome:  In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient treated with CTX -> then switched to levoaquin monotherapy, and had rapid improvement with stabilization of pressures and marked diuresis and start of resolution of ARF on CRI.
Coagulopathy:  patient on coumadin for h/o antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
CAD:  pt presented with chest pain not c/w previous ischemia, no ECG changes, normal cardiac enzymes.
No evidence of pulmonary edema on initial CXR, but with pulm edema on day #2 after IVF load.
Gastroparesis:  complication of DM; reglan held as it is a new medication and patient with MS changes and ARF in patient with h/o urinary retention.
Sciatica:  d/t disc herniation; s/p steroid course and taper, treated in house with oxycodone prn for pain control per home regimen 11.
Diarrhea:  seems to be resolved now; may be have been antibiotic associated; was likely the etiology of her metabolic alkalosis as diarrheal dehydration causing contraction alkalosis 13.
She also has known proliferative diabetic retinopathy s/p PRP OU, which has resulted in decreased peripheral visual fields.
