History of Present Illness: Patient is a 80 M with hx of Mod-severe COPD with hypoxemia, pulm HTN, PVD, CRI now s/p achilles tendon lengthening procedure who has been persistently hypoxic following procedure.
This is likely a continuation of his chronic state.
He is being admitted to the MICU for monitoring overnight.

Assessment:Pt is a 80 y/o M with COPD/emphysema here with increased hypoxia postop secondary to aspiration PNA s/p Achilles tendon surgery.
Hypoxia: This patient has a long standing history of COPD and an oxygen requirement at home.
PFT results from [**2129-6-17**] show no exacerbation of underlying emphysema/COPD/pulm HTN.
Given interval change of LLL opacities on CXRs from [**6-8**] to [**6-15**], and decreased BS/egophony on physical exam, and increased oxygen requirements, hypoxia is likely attributed to an aspiration PNA s/p surgery, also possibly involving sedation from perioperative opiages.
No levofloxacin given the new black box warnings on tendon/ligament tears, and patient is s/p achilles tendon lengthening procedure.
CRI: Patient had elevated Cre up to 1.7, and had an episode of oliguria requirng a straight-cath that returned 250 ccs of fluid.
Bladder scan revealed no obstruction or residual fluid.
