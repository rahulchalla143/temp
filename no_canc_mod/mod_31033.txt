In summary, the patient is a 51-year-old female presenting from an outside hospital with MSSA bacteremia and meningitis.
At [**Hospital1 **], she was noted to have a left psoas abscess and this was discussed with the surgery interventional radiology team who felt that medical management with antibiotics was suggested for the psoas abscess.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or calcifications or other lesions.
In the left kidney along the inferior pole, there is a region of cortical scarring.
SPEP revealed multiple low concentration bands seen in the gamma region.
UPEP showed that there was no protein indicated and was negative for Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] protein.
The patient had a renal workup which was notable for negative urinalysis and no evidence of infection, after the increase in the white blood cell count.
There are no appreciable eosinophils and spun urine sediment was negative for casts.
The patient, during this hospitalization, was encouraged to drink fluids and she also received some IV fluids, given an initial urine sodium of less than 1 suggesting a prerenal component of the renal function.
Also, it was felt that the vancomycin or rifampin which the patient had been on may have been causing a component of the renal function.
It was felt that the patient had a high likelihood of recover of her renal function within the next five to ten days.
Hematology:  During this [**Hospital 228**] hospital admission, she had an admission hematocrit of 32.2 on [**10-8**] with a steady drop in hematocrit to 22.8 on [**10-24**].
Iron studies sent on [**10-20**] revealed a decreased TIBC of 217, increased ferritin of 368, and iron levels of 55.
The patient was guaiac negative, and denied any bright red blood per rectum or melanotic stools.
The haptoglobin was slightly elevated at 266.
The patient's isolated falling hematocrit with a low reticulocyte count is suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
Iron studies also suggested anemia of chronic disease, as well.
It was also felt that gradual increase in hematocrit drop may also be due in part to daily phlebotomy labs in the setting of decreased production of red cells.
The patient also had some thrombocytosis and it was felt the thrombocytosis was relatively reactive due to infection and was resolving upon her discharge.
The patient had complained of some weakness and lightheadedness and was, thus, transfused a unit of packed red blood cells for relief of symptoms.
Infectious diseases:  The patient presented to the outside hospital with the MSSA bacteremia and meningitis.
Given the patient's changing renal function, the Infectious Disease service was reconsulted to evaluate for her antibiotic treatments and resolution of the left psoas abscess.
A repeat MRI for evaluation of the left psoas abscess revealed a left psoas abscess at approximately L4-L5 which does not appear to be as extensive in volume compared to the previous examination from [**2129-10-12**].
There was no evidence of discitis.
There is no evidence of an epidural abscess, at the time.
The patient had resolution of the white blood cells seen previously on her cerebrospinal fluid at the outside hospital.
In addition, she is to follow-up with checking her vancomycin trough and Chem-7's to follow her renal function for vancomycin dosing with critical care systems home infusion.
