Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Stent graft repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm [**2133-1-27**]   History of Present Illness: This is an 80-year-old female with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who presented to an outside institution complaining of chest pain upon further workup and being ruled out for cardiac ischemia.
She underwent a CT of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolism.
During this time, it was noted that the patient had a descending thoracic aneurysm which appeared to be a pseudoaneurysm or an ulcerated plaque along the middle portion of the dilated aorta.
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 11419**] here, she underwent a repeat CAT scan which was contrast with arterial phase imaging which revealed no extravasation of contrast at this point and no dissection.
Upon further review, between both the cardiac and vascular teams, it was decided that a vascular repair to prevent possible free rupture was indicated.

HEENT: wnl Heart: RRR Lungs: clear bilaterally Abd: soft, non-tender Extremities: warm, palpable pulses  Pertinent Results: [**2133-1-24**] 3:54 PM CTA chest with and w/o contrast IMPRESSION: Focal outpouching off the aortic arch, just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, which likely reflects a thrombosed pseudoaneurysm of the thoracic aorta or less likely a saccular aneurysm.
No evidence of dissection or extravasation of contrast is seen, and no pericardial effusion is present.

Upon further review, between both the cardiac and vascular teams, it was decided that a vascular repair to prevent possible free rupture was indicated.
Vascular Surgery was consulted and after discussion with the patient, the patient agreed to proceed with vascular repair of thoracic aneurysm with thoracic Endograft via percutaneous approach.
CV: she had some episodes of tachycradia in the ICU wherein she was given Metoprolol IV, was converted to PO once taking po's.
