She was previously normal functioning with HTN and tobacco use and had a pontine hemorrhage on [**2170-7-10**].
I spoke on the phone with nursing staff at the rehab facility who stated that the pt was having no signs of verbal or non-verbal communication or interaction.
The temp remained elevated to 106 and the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
She was noted to have an elevated WBC count to 17.4 and CXR was initially read as c/w PNA.
HTN former smoker .
nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly EXT: no c/c/e NEURO: eyes open spontaneously, flaccid tone in BUE and BLE.
No ankle clonus.
There are reduced lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding.
Mild superimposed edema persists.
No new focal consolidation is seen.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
CT head [**9-19**] - There are areas of low attenuation within the pons, which likely represent changes from the patient's known prior pontine hemorrhage.
No intracranial hemorrhages are identified.
The ventricles are symmetric, there is no shift of normally midline structures.
There are several areas of low attenuation within the subcortical white matter, which may represent changes from chronic small vessel ischemic infarct, though the patient is slightly young to have these findings.
Fever/leukocytosis: We initially began empiric CAP treatment with Zosyn and Vancomycin, however it was felt that given the chest films unimpressive for pneumonia, it was more likely to be a bronchitis that would be better treated with a course of azithromycin 500mg QD for 10 days.
Neurology evaluated the patient and felt that her high temperatures are secondary to autoregulatory temperature instability.
Blood, urine culture and chest xray were unremarkable for signs of infection and this was not felt to be a CNS infection that required an LP.
Seizure activity?/vegetative state: the patient was started on dilantin originally as there was a question of seizure because of vertical nystagmus, however this was stopped after 2 days as EEG was negative for seizure activity while nystagmus continued.
Vertical nystagmus likely secondary to pontine hemorrhage with high fevers.
CT head did not demonstrate acute changes.
3. troponin elevation:  The patient had a mild bump in her troponin to 0.1 but had a negative CK in the setting of no prior cardiac hx.
This was felt to be a nonspecific finding in the setting of acute illness.
Motrin 100 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Four Hundred (400) mg PO three times a day as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary - temperature dysregulation secondary to autonomic dysfunction, bronchitis  Secondary - s/p pontine hemorrhage, persistent vegatative state, HTN   Discharge Condition: Stable, but febrile persistently secondary to autonomic dysfunction   Discharge Instructions: -continue tylenol around the clock as directed for control fevers, which are secondary to autonomic dysfunction and not infection -continue azithromycin for a total of 10 days for treatment of bronchitis -continue frequent suctioning as needed  Followup Instructions: Per rehab protocol    Completed by:[**2170-9-21**
