No acute intracranial pathology.
Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
[**2-8**] CXR: Low lung volumes with stable scarring in the right upper lobe.
No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
A large venous varix at the portosystemic confluence, with an intraluminal filling defect, which likely represents thrombus.
Recommended a non-emergent ultrasound for further assessment of internal vascularity.
Associated chronic thrombosis of the right portal vein and aneurysmal dilation of the left and main portal veins.
No acute intra-abdominal pathology identified to explain the patient's fever.
Large left renal cortical cyst, a smaller left renal hypodense lesion is not characterized in this study, may represent a hyperdense cyst.
Multiple thoracic vertebral compression fractures, likely chronic.
Old pelvic fractures.
Mild cardiomegaly.
Multifocal airspace opacities unchanged.
Small left retrocardiac opacity unchanged.
Mild interstitial edema unchanged.
Large left kidney lower pole renal cyst.
The upper pole cyst of the left kidney is incompletely imaged due to breathing motion; suboptimal evaluation.
Cholelithiasis; no acute cholecystitis.
Echocardiogram The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
If indicated, a TEE would better exclude a small valvular vegetation.
[**2-13**] ultrasound of liver with doppler The liver appears normal in size, echogenicity and architecture.
There are no focal liver lesions seen.
Multiple small subcentimeter gallstones are present without signs of cholecystitis and there is no evidence of bile duct dilatation.
There is no evidence of ascites or splenomegaly.
Grayscale, color flow and pulse Doppler assessment of the portal venous system was next performed.
Most of the aneurysm is filled with organized clot which has partially retracted from the walls and around which there is continuous venous flow.
Immediately to the right of the spleno-portal aneurysm there is evidence of cavernous transformation of the portal vein with numerous dilated collateral channels which reconstitute at the portal bifurcation.
There is cavernous transformation of the portal vein with reconstitution of both the left and right intrahepatic portal trunks with patency confirmed by Doppler.
Just proximal to the cavernous transformation is aneurysmal dilatation of the SV/PV confluence, and a large but nonocclusive clot is present within the aneurysm.
Brief Hospital Course: 86 YO F NH resident w/afib s/p CABG presented with fever and hypotension .
#Hypotension: Met criteria for septic shock in setting of refractory hypotension.
Most likely etiology was pneumonia of either viral or bacterial origin initially.
CXR showed possible opacification in right upper lobe which corroborated with crackles on physical exam.
She lives in group home and was at risk for MDR pathogens.
Meningitis and encephelitis were considered less likely given that she had no headaches and no meningial signs on exam.
Abdominal infection and UTI less likely considering normal physical exam and normal UA.
There were some evidence of sinusitis on CTA however no clinical evidence and thus it was lower on the differential.
She was started imperically on vancomyin, zoysn, levoquin and osletamivir ([**2-9**]) for empiric coverage for HCAP and influenza.
She did have [**2-19**] blood cultures from [**2-8**] which grew gram positive Cocci which later speciated as strep.
She did have a CT abdomen looking for a source of her original fever which revealed the incidental finding of portal vein thrombus and spleno-portal varix of undtermined age.
A TEE was not done because of anxiety the patient was experiencing during the admission and the significant sedatives she would require for such a procedure.
Panorex of the mandible was done to assess dentition as cause of her strep viridans and was negative according to dental consult for signs of infection.
This was of an unclear etiology, but likely do to her pneumonia and bacteremia.
#.Delirium/dementia: Patient's baseline mental status was not clear at time of admission, however, per caretaker, AxOx3.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been the result of infective process.
Held metoprolol initially given hypotension secondary to sepsis.
# Porto-splenic varix: Seen incidentally on CT. Abdominal ultrasound ordered to investigate for thrombus, which was seen in portal vein.
Ultrasound with doppler were repeated to assess the porto-spleno varix and portal vein thrombus with cavernous transformation seen of portal vein and aneurysm proximally seen near portal spelnic junction with nonocclusive clot.Family made aware.
