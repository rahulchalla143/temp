Admission Date:  [**2197-12-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-12-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p cardiac cath with PCI stenting to LAD  History of Present Illness: 87 yo female with PMH of HTN, breast ca presented to OSH with 2 day history of SOB.
Pt states that 2 days prior to admission, she experienced SOB while watching TV lasting for ~30 minutes associated with chest tightness which resolved spontaneously.
On day of presentation to OSH woke up feeling bad and had another episode of SOB which increased on walking.
At the OSH, pt was sent to the CCU where she was ruled out for MI, treated for CHF with diuresis.
Given the new Q waves on ECG and negative cardiac enzymes, pt likely had an MI sometime in the weeks preceding admission.
Pt was found to have intermittent episodes of bradycardia secondary to Mobitz type 2.
She had one episode of diaphoresis, hypotension, bradycardia, likely secondary to heart block and was transiently on dopamine.
An echo was performed which showed EF 25-30%; anterior, septal, apical akinesis; mild-mod MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 29817**] was performed which found LAD stenosis of 90-95%, RCA lesion 80-85%, LVEDF 20-28mmHg.
Pt transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for interventional cath.
Past Medical History: HTN breast cancer (s/p lumpectomy and XRT 6 years ago) back pain no DM, hyperlipidemia, previously diagnosed CAD  Social History: lives at home by herself, elderly living quit tobacco 20 years ago; smoked 1 ppd x 15 years Drinks 3 drinks/week Denies drugs  Family History: no CAD  Physical Exam: VS: p76, 121/43, rr31, 97% Gen: lying in bed, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, dry MM, clear OP, 2+ carotids, L bruit CVS: RRR, nl s1 s2, no m/g/r Pulm: scattered anterolateral crackles Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, +BS Extremity: no edema bilaterally, 2+ DP, right femoral groin line in place with temporary pacing wire  Pertinent Results: [**2197-12-11**] 10:39PM   WBC-5.3 RBC-2.86* HGB-9.4* HCT-27.9* MCV-98 MCH-32.8* MCHC-33.7 RDW-13.6 [**2197-12-11**] 10:39PM   PLT COUNT-237 [**2197-12-11**] 10:39PM   PT-14.1* PTT-36.8* INR(PT)-1.3 .
[**2197-12-11**] EKG Sinus rhythm @56 with intermittent AV block and demand ventricular pacing Conduction defect of RBBB type Probable septal infarct .
[**2197-12-12**] CXR portable: AP PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is a temporay pacer wire, whose distal marker is in the right ventricle.
There is a proximal radiopaque marker in the region of the tricuspid valve.
There are calcifications seen at the aortic arch.
There is a small right-sided pleural effusion, and redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild CHF.
In the left upper lung zone, there is an ill-defined opacity, for which a follow up PA and lateral chest radiograph is recommended when the patient is stable for further evaluation of this finding.
2) Mild CHF.
3) Ill-defined opacity in the left upper lobe for which a PA and lateral chest radiograph study is recommended prior to patient discharge.
No evidence of pneumothorax is noted.
Again, note is made of slightly increased pulmonary vasculature, with pleural effusion, representing CHF.
The effusion is slightly increased compared to the previous study.
Again, note is made of left upper lobe nodular opacity, as mentioned on the previous study, as well as possible small nodular opacities in the right lower lobe.
This may represent calcified granulomas in this patient with calcified right paratracheal nodes.
However, comparison with more distant prior studies, as well as clinical correlation is recommended to exclude other etiology.
IMPRESSION: Satisfactory positioning of the DDD pacemaker leads; no evidence of pneumothorax.
Mild CHF with increased effusion.
Continued bilateral nodular opacities, most prominent in the left upper lobe, with calcified lymph nodes, which may represent calcified granulomas.
Selective left circulation angiography with limited views demonstrated a 99% proximal LAD lesion which was successfully stented with a cypher stent.
Pt remained chest pain free and hemodynamically stable throughout hospitalization.
On evening of HD1, pt had several episodes of 2:1 AV node block secondary to Mobitz type 2 second degree block with stable vital and no symptoms.
Pt became confused overnight and pulled out her temporary pacing wire.
Implantation of AICD in this pt with CAD and EF<30% was considered.
CXR post-pacer placement showed mild CHF with increased effusion.
Pt did not have any respiratory symptoms and maintained good O2 saturation throughout hospitalization.
