HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin), and congestive heart failure who now presents with severe explosive diarrhea.
During her prior hospitalization, she was noted to have a pneumonia and was started on antibiotic therapy.
She was reportedly discharged in good condition; however, during the ambulance ride to the nursing home she developed explosive diarrhea and became tachycardic.
This was consistent with congestive heart failure.
There were also bibasilar effusions and consolidation at the left lung base.
The overall impression was that this chest x-ray revealed improvement of her underlying congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease; status post non-ST-elevation segment myocardial infarction.
History of peptic ulcer disease.
History of carotid stenosis.
Sublingual nitroglycerin.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No history of intravenous drug use.
Neck revealed jugular venous distention approximately 9 cm.
There was no lymphadenopathy appreciated on examination.
Pulmonary examination revealed diffuse crackles throughout and mild expiratory wheezes.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
There was no calf tenderness.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the setting of explosive diarrhea and tachycardic, it was felt that the patient was mildly volume depleted.
In addition, she had dry mucous membranes.
It was also felt that due to her recent antibiotic therapy for pneumonia, a likely etiology of her diarrhea could be Clostridium difficile.
The following day a cardiac echocardiogram was obtained which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
There was mild aortic valve stenosis and trace aortic regurgitation.
There was moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
An electrocardiogram was also obtained which demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
There was mild left axis deviation.
There were some nonspecific extensive ST segment changes.
The patient was noted to have an elevated troponin.
However, this was believed to be secondary to her non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction which she reportedly had during her [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit stay.
The plan was to discharge the patient if her white blood cell count improved on Flagyl therapy and if the Clostridium difficile toxin assay was positive.
