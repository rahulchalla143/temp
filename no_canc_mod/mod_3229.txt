For the past one year she still complained of limited exercise capacity, more severe dyspnea, and chest tightness.
She denied any severe or sustained episodes of chest pain, orthopnea, PND, palpitations, syncope.
We felt that renal angiography was warranted secondary to her marked hypertension despite medical management with multiple medications in order to evaluate for possible renal artery stenosis.
Catheterization showed LAD occluded proximally, left circumflex with nondominant vessel with previous stent patent with diffuse in-stent restenosis with competitive flow distally filling the saphenous vein graft.
Renal angiography showed eccentric 40% lesion in the right renal artery and no disease in the left renal artery.
The patient was noted to have a large hematoma in her right groin several hours post catheterization on [**2155-7-4**].
Pressure was applied by nurses and resulted in hemostatic control.
Early on [**2155-7-5**], the patient began to complain of abdominal pain radiating from her groin to the epigastrium.
Repeat hematocrits showed a decline in her hematocrit value from 30 to 24.6.
On the morning of [**2155-7-5**] at 6:00 a.m. she began to complain of sharp pain at her groin site.
The ultrasound noted an echogenic mass 8.6 times 10.6 cm consistent with right femoral hematoma with pseudoaneurysm formation, an arterial venous communication.
Repeat catheterization in [**3-5**] with diffuse and severe disease, almost totally occluded saphenous vein graft to PDA.
Diabetes mellitus type 2, inulin-requiring, with retinopathy.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post right femoral popliteal bypass in [**1-4**].
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of fecal incontinence.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient reports brother deceased from MI at age 59.
General appearance:  Well developed, obese white female, lying flat, in no acute distress.
Pupils unequal; left pupil pinpoint, minimally reactive, right pupil with anisocoria, nonreactive.
Neck:  Supple, no masses or lymphadenopathy, 2+ carotid pulses, no delayed upstroke, no carotid bruits, unable to asses JVP.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Groin: Right groin with 18 by 12 cm hematoma, purplish skin discoloration, firm to hard consistency, no bruit auscultated.
Nonspecific lateral changes.
Coronary catheterization on [**2155-7-4**] (native three vessel disease), left main with no significant obstructive disease, LAD subtotally occluded in midvessel and filled distally via LIMA to LAD, left circumflex 30% narrowing proximally, OM2 with diffuse 70% proximal disease, competitive flow from SVG to OM1/OM2 distally, OM3 70% diffuse disease beyond which had a competitive flow from saphenous vein graft to OM1/OM2.
RCA with mild diffuse disease and proximal and midvessel.
Distal RCA 50% discreet stenosis, right PDA a small vessel with discreet 80% stenosis proximally and diffuse disease distally.
Pulmonary artery pressure elevated at 33/9.
Mild diffuse in abdominal aorta.
Right renal artery with 40% eccentric stenosis at origin.
Left renal artery with no significant obstructive disease.
Femoral ultrasound ([**2155-7-6**]):  Large heterogenous echogenic mass measuring 8.6 by 10.6 cm corresponding to large hematoma.
Within the heterogenous mass there is a focal area of 2-and-Fro vascular flow measuring 2.8 by 2.5 cm, consistent with a pseudoaneurysm.
The neck of the pseudoaneurysm measures approximately 8 mm.
Adjacent and superior to pseudoaneurysm, images of vascular flow demonstrated turbulent color flow pattern, consistent with AV fistula.
Initially, the patient's other outpatient hypertensives including ACE inhibitor, nitrates, calcium channel blockers were held secondary to the concern for hemodynamic instability in light of her hematoma formation status post catheterization.
Additionally, cardiac enzymes were cycled and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Serial EKGs demonstrated no evidence of ischemic changes.
As the patient's hematoma stabilized and status post vascular repair of her pseudoaneurysm, it was felt that hemodynamic stability was no longer a concern.
She maintained stable blood pressures for the first several days of her hospital course and, thereafter, demonstrated elevated blood pressures.
It showed mild dilatation of the left atrium.
There was mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal-inferior and inferoseptal walls.
There was no aortic valve stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
Mild 1+ mitral regurgitation was seen.
There was a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
She had no evidence of any arrhythmic events.
RIGHT GROIN HEMATOMA STATUS POST CATHETERIZATION: Vascular Surgery consultation was obtained.
As she was felt to be unstable, and the pseudoaneurysm contributing to this blood loss, she underwent surgical repair of her right femoral hematoma and pseudoaneurysm on [**2155-7-8**].
Vascular Surgery continued to follow her status post repair with wound checks and general wound care.
The patient continued to drain minimal amounts of serosanguinous fluid.
At the time of this dictation, drains were still in place, Vascular Surgery still following the patient for wound care and Kefzol antibiotic therapy was started for new onset erythema around the right groin incisional sites.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE STATUS POST CORONARY CATHETERIZATION:  On admission to the CCU, the patient's creatinine was evaluated to a value of 1.8, baseline creatinines ranged from 1.1 to 1.3 per the medical record review.
However, evaluation of her urinary electrolytes and urine studies demonstrated evidence of prerenal azotemia.
Therefore, the patient's outpatient diuretic doses were held and she was volume resuscitated with IV fluids and multiple blood transfusions.
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY EDEMA:  In the morning of [**2155-7-13**], the patient complained of edema of the right upper extremity.
The patient was evaluated with a right upper extremity ultrasound.
After her hematoma and pseudoaneurysm was stabilized, post surgical repair, her activity level was advanced as tolerated.
Postprocedure hemorrhage.
Precipitous drop in hematocrit.
Renal artery atherosclerosis.
Right femoral pseudoaneurysm repair.
Acute renal failure.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
as needed for constipation.
