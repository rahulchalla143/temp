ECHO [**2114-9-20**]: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac source of thromboembolism identified.
Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No clinically significant valvular disease.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
CAROTIDS [**2114-9-20**]: normal   Brief Hospital Course: 79 year-old R-handed man with hx of prostate ca s/p brachytherapy, HTN, HL, headaches and bladder ca s/p resection surgery [**2114-8-13**] who presented from an OSH with a R inraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Upon review of his imaging, there is no evidence of obvious malignancy or vasculitis that would cause his hemorrhage, nor is there evidence that this is obviously a venous clot.
There are some small DWI lesions in the ACA territory that are suggestive of an embolic infarct with subsequent hemorhagic conversion.
In addition, his subdural hematoma could have been caused by his head strike, but could also be from a rupture of his more frontal hematoma into the subdural space.
# NEURO: patient was evaluated for possible cause of his stroke.
His echo was unremarkable and his carotid duplex showed 0% stenosis bilaterally.
We stopped his statin as it was low dose and there is some increased risk of bleeding, and there is not a significant benefit for this medication.
The patient did well and continued to improve - he does have a fixed belief that he is in his home, despite being aware of the evidence that he is not - likely reduplicative paraamnesia as a result of his bleed.
# CARDS: we held pt's home dose simvastatin as he was only on 5mg and we felt that amyloid was a likely source of his bleed, making his statin contraindicated.
He had one episode of chest pain and his tpns and EKG were normal.
We did start him on a baby aspirin and metoprolol as he was hypertensive and was placed on an aspirin for prophylaxis  # ID: patient came from OSH with a documeted proteus UTI.
Medications on Admission: - magnesium oxide 200mg QD - meloxicam 7.5mg QD - MVI QD - nitrofurantoin (started on [**9-13**] by urologist) - prilosec 20mg QD - simvastatin 5mg QD - vicodin 5/500mg Q6H PRN pain   Discharge Medications: 1. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
3. famotidine 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for prophylaxis.

You were found to have had a right sided bleed in your brain causing you to have some left sided weakness.
You were monitored, and when it was determined your bleed was stable you were able to be sent to a rehabilitation facility to get stronger and improve your balance.
