Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Line Placement Arterial Line Placement Intubation Mechanical Ventilation Bronchoscopy PICC line placement Dobhoff tube placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55F from [**Hospital3 4298**] with history of autoimmune hepatitis on azathioprine who is admitted to the MICU for worsening SOB.
Her symptoms failed to improve.
CXR was concerning for a bilateral pna, and she was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management as she receives her hepatology care here.
She had oral thrush on exam as well as an infected tooth.
She had diffuse left sided crackles.
The morning of transfer, she was found to be increasingly tachypneic with an increased O2 requirement.
She is transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring given concern for respiratory decompensation.
She has some loose stools along with her respiratory symptoms.

Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2130-4-27**]):       No respiratory viruses isolated.
[**4-30**] BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE     GRAM STAIN (Final [**2130-4-30**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2130-5-1**]):    NEGATIVE for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)..     FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):       YEAST, PRESUMPTIVELY NOT C. ALBICANS.
ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2130-5-1**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):  [**5-5**] Urine culture negative [**5-6**] C. diff negative [**5-7**] C. diff negative [**5-7**] CMV VL negative [**5-17**] Urine culture negative [**5-21**] Urine culture negative  Tularemia pending Adenovirus PCR negative Aspergillus negative Beta glucan negative Blastomycosis negative Coccidiomycosis negative  STUDIES: [**4-23**] PA AND LATERAL CXR: IMPRESSION: Multiple new patchy airspace opacities bilaterally, most prominent in the left lower lung, consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Follow- up is recommended to ensure clearance  [**4-25**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast however images were suboptimal and patient was unable to cooperate with maneuvers.
No evidence of pulmonary AV shunting identified by technically limited agitated saline study.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
Extensive multifocal consolidation in both lungs which on review of prior imaging has developed and progressed since the radiograph of [**2130-4-23**].
These findings are most suggestive of with multifocal pneumonia.
Incompletely assesed splenomegaly, perisplenic ascites and inflammatory change in the mesentry of the upper abdomen  [**4-30**] CT CHEST: IMPRESSION: 1.
Extensive patchy air space opacification scattered throughout both lungs is similar in distribution and extent to CT performed on [**2130-4-26**], but less dense in most locstions, compatible with some improvement.
The differential diagnosis for this appearance is broad but includes resolving multifocal pneumonia or edema.
Cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites.
[**5-2**] RENAL U/S: FINDINGS: Study is slightly limited secondary to difficulties with patient positioning.
No stones, hydronephrosis, or solid masses are identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis  [**5-10**] PORTABLE CXR: REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient with multifocal pneumonia.
There is overall no change in the widespread parenchymal opacities, although compared to more remote studies, there is some degree of improvement.
[**5-12**]: Swallow Study: Reason for Exam: Concern for aspiration.
A swallowing videofluoroscopy study was done in conjunction with the speech pathology service.
Multiple consistencies of oral barium were administered.
Barium passed beyond the oropharynx without evidence of obstruction.
Successful ultrasound-guided paracentesis of 700 cc of yellow serosanguineous fluid.
[**5-17**]: EEG Reason for Exam: Altered Mental Status.
This is an abnormal routine EEG due to a slow and poorly modulated background indicative of a mild encephalopathy.
There were no areas of focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings.
There was no evidence of epileptiform discharges noted.
Note is also made of a mild tachycardia on cardiac telemetry.
[**5-20**] Abdominal CT: Reason for Exam: Rule out recto/colovesicular fistula.
[**5-23**] Barium Enema: Reason for Exam: Rule out recto/colvesicular fistula.
No rectovesicular fistula.
SUMMARY OF MICU COURSE: - Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: Patient was treated for typical and atypical bacteria, including PCP (although this was stopped after several negative BALs) and tularemia (s/p doxycycline treatment).
She had increased respiratory distress on [**4-29**], failing bipap, and at that time, she and her family decided to reverse her DNR/DNI to full code and thus, she was intubated and mechanically ventilated.
- Acute renal failure: Cr noted to increase to 1.6 and urine studies were consistent with pre-renal state.
She was given IVFs with some improvement.
Renal ultrasound negative for hydronephrosis.
They felt this was likely secondary to azathioprine.
She was given 1 dose of Neupogen and no longer neutropenic.
- Tooth infection: Patient with dental infection.
She remained afebrile without further need for antibiotic therapy.
Tuleremia is still pending on discharge.
Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status continued to wax and wane despite lactulose, which led to the conclusion that it was not solely due to hepatic encephalopathy but delirium.
A CT head non-contrast was performed but showed no acute processes.
Neurology and Psychiatry were consulted to further work up the patient's change in mental status.
Both consults felt the mental status change was secondary to a multifactorial delirium.
EEG was performed and showed no evidence of epileptic activity.
Possible Rectovesicular Fistula: After transfer to the floor a dark brown sediment was found in the foley catheter bag.
Urinalysis and urine cultures were negative for infection.
Hypernatremia:  On the floor the patients hypernatremia continued while she refused to eat or have a dobhoff tube placed.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Month/Day (4) **]: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler [**Month/Day (3) **]: [**11-25**]  Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing: 1-2 puffs as needed for shortness of breath.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Multifocal pneumonia Hepatic encephalopathy Autoimmune hepatitis Abdominal Hernia   Discharge Condition: afebrile, hemodynamically stable, off oxygen supplementation   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with multifocal pnemonia and confusion.
You were also found to have an umbilical hernia.
- Vit D/Calcium was started - Lansoprazole was started at 30mg daily - Furosemide was changed to 20mg daily - Spironalactone was changed to 50mg daily  If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers/chills, abdominal pains, diarrhea or any other concerning symptoms please call your doctor or return to the emergency room.
With a hernia if you ever have severe abdominal pain, trouble moving your bowels, or blood in your stool you should contact your doctor or go to the emergency room immediately.
