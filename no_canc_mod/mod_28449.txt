He has new upper extremity weakness and cord contusion is strongly suspected clinically.
FINDINGS: There is prevertebral soft tissue swelling as well as soft tissue density in the nasopharynx, which could represent vomitus or blood, but the appearance is nonspecific.
There is no definite fracture, but there are severe multilevel degenerative changes.
These include large osteophytes which are partly fragmented along the anterior aspect of C2, particularly C3 as well, there is a huge osteophyte along C4 extending upwards.
There is slight retrolisthesis and exaggerated lordosis at the C3-C4 level.
There are posterior disc protrusions at C3-C4 and C5-C6 with severe spinal stenosis at these levels, and the neural foramina are also very narrow at C3- C4.
It is difficult to assess for contusion or hematoma.
Prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
No definite fracture.
Severe spinal stenosis particularly at C3-C4.
Given severe degenerative changes and ankylosing osteophytes, MRI would be helpful in excluding ligamentous injury.
A second view, not labeled as to time, demonstrates anterior plate and screws and intervening fusion plug at C3/4, with minimal retrolisthesis of C3/4 and widening laterally.
There is severe background osteopenia.
