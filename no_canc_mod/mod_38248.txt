Admission Date:  [**2178-2-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-2-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2141-7-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: fall, headache after fall   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 36M with history of one seizure last year who per report had a seizure and fell from standing height.
No LOC, but immediately had a headache after fall.
HEENT: Gross blood in right ear canal.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
FINDINGS: Since [**2178-2-20**] there has been slight interval decrease of size and density of the thin left subdural hematoma, layering along the left frontotemporal convexity.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or large acute territorial infarction is seen.
The extensive longitudinal fracture of the right temporal bone, involving that middle ear cavity and carotid canal, and exiting at the right sphenoid air cell, is better-demonstrated on the thin-section CTA of [**2178-2-20**]; there are persistent layering blood products in the right sphenoid air cell.
IMPRESSION: Significant interval decrease in size and density of the left subdural hematoma, NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The thin left-sided subdural hematoma is now poorly-seen, likely due to interval resorption/redistribution.
No new hemorrhage is demonstrated.
There is a small subdural hematoma seen in the left frontal and temporal region.
No fracture seen in this region.
There is no mass effect, midline shift, or hydrocephalus.
No intraparenchymal hematoma or subarachnoid hemorrhage seen.
Bone images demonstrate fracture in the right parietal region extending to squamous temporal bone and to the mastoid and petrous temporal region.
There is a longitudinal fracture of the right petrous temporal bone extending through the skull base and involving portion of the carotid canal and extending to the right side of the sphenoid sinus with a small fluid level in the right sphenoid sinus.
There are soft tissue changes likely secondary to blood seen in the external auditory canal as well as in the middle ear.
CT CERVICAL SPINE:  The cervical spine CT demonstrate no fracture or subluxation.
There is no evidence of prevertebral soft tissue abnormality.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK: CT angiography of the neck demonstrates no evidence of vascular injury or dissection.
No stenosis or occlusion seen.
Postoperative changes are seen in the right clavicle.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD: CT angiography of the head and skull base demonstrate no evidence of vascular injury or dissection.
The arteries of the anterior and posterior circulation are well maintained without stenosis or occlusion.
Head CT demonstrates longitudinal fracture of the right temporal bone extending to the carotid canal and right side of the sphenoid sinus with a blood fluid level in the right sphenoid sinus.
Small left-sided subdural hematoma is seen.
No cervical spine fracture identified.
CT angiography of the neck demonstrate no evidence of vascular injury in the neck.
Postoperative changes are seen in relation with the right clavicle.
CT angiography of the head demonstrate no evidence of vascular injury in relation with the right carotid artery.
In particular, no dissection or stenosis seen or occlusion identified in the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 36 year old male  with history of one seizure last year who per reports that he had a seizure and fell from standing height on [**2178-2-20**].
The patient denied loss of consciousness, but immediately had a headache after fall.
The head Ct was consistent with significant interval decrease in size and density of the left subdural hematoma and extensive longitudinal fracture of the right temporal bone, involving that middle ear cavity and carotid canal, and exiting at the right sphenoid air cell.
The neurological exam was intact but there was a possible csf leak noted from the right ear.
On [**2178-2-21**], ENT was consulted and the recommendations included to initiate CSF leak precautions (HOB elevation, stool softeners, sneeze with mouth open, no nose blowing).There was no need for systemic antibiotics.
Neurology was consulted and recommended a urine analysis which was negative, urine toxicity screen which was positive for opiates and barbituates,chest xray,LFTs which were within normal limits,routine EEG as an outpatient with outpatient follow-up with Epilepsy Dept.
