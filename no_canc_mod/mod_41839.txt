HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old male with multiple medical problems found down in his assisted-living facility seizing in bed.
Of note, the patient had just been discharged on the [**8-31**] from [**Hospital6 **] after an unrevealing five day workup for abdominal pain.
When the nurse returned with pain medicine five minutes later, the patient was found to be tonic-clonic seizures, unresponsive.
En route to the hospital, he was given lidocaine for question of increased intracranial pressure.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, a CT of the head was performed, which showed evidence of an old CVA, but no acute hemorrhage.
The patient was given 2 grams of Rocephin prior to the LP for meningitis prophylaxis.
At the time, the patient was unresponsive to deep painful stimuli, but was minimally responsive to deep sternal rub.
Diabetes mellitus x15 years.
Coronary artery disease status post cardiac catheterization with three-vessel disease not intervened upon because there were no critical lesions at the time.
History of peripheral vascular disease status post left below the knee amputation.
Status post CVA diffuse ischemic of unknown date.
Right eye enucleation for phthisis bulbi, legally blind in his left eye.
COPD with some component of restrictive disease as well by pulmonary function tests performed in [**2124**] demonstrating FVC and FEV1 of 30% of predicted, FEV1 to FVC ratio of 120% of predicted.
Acute atypical psychosis.
Osteomyelitis status post debridement procedure and amputation of several toes of the right leg in [**2123**].
Chronic pancreatitis with history of chronic alcohol abuse.
L3-L4, L4-L5 spinal stenosis status post laminectomy.
General:  Intubated, sedated, and unresponsive to painful stimuli.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, clicks, or gallops.
Poor peripheral pulses.
CT of the head:  No bleed, multiple old infarcts, sinus inflammation.
EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute with T-wave inversions in V4 through V6 with ST depressions of 1 mm in V5 and V6.
It is likely that he has underlying areas of ischemia secondary to massive CVA.
He seems to have suffered anoxic brain injury as he had several episodes of myoclonic jerks, which could be consistent with [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Location (un) 1683**] syndrome as well as some component of hypoglycemia.
An EEG was performed, which shows diffuse slow wave pattern, which ruled out status epilepticus and suggest some sort of encephalopathy perhaps due to sepsis.
Aspiration pneumonia:  Originally the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia was entertained given the food contents were suctioned from the ET tube.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient did have mild elevation of the troponins, but CKs were negative although rising in the setting of lateral T-wave changes, and lateral ST depressions.
It is likely that the patient did experience some sort of demand ischemia with whatever inciting events had occurred.
He was given aspirin and beta blocker, however, Heparin was not initiated due to his allergy of unknown type.
Access:  An A-line was placed for arterial monitoring and pneumoboots were used for DVT prophylaxis.
Code status:  Discussion with the [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy, it was felt that the patient would want to be do not resuscitate/do not intubate comfort measures only given his prior poor functional status and new diagnosis with extremely poor prognosis.
