# Hyponatremia: The patient's history and physical exam was consistent with volume depletion, with Na of 107.
Following hydration, the Na did not entirely correct, indicating a possible component of SIADH secondary to COPD and recent PNA.
In addition, the patient had recently been on steroids and there was concern for adrenal insufficiency.
# Adrenal Insufficiency:  Per Endocrinology, recent Cosyntropin stimulation testing revealed a mildly suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with a low baseline cortisol level and an insufficient response to ACTH stimulation.
This is most likely secondary to chronic inhaled steroid therapy, though recent treatment with Prednisone (last given on [**2195-8-4**]) may have contributed.
The presenting symptoms of nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and hyponatremia were considered to be partially due to this insufficiency.
No exacerbation during this admission.
During the admission, the patient did not have an increased O2 requirement.
# A-Fib: AICD in place.
EKG shows he is ventricularly paced, no ischemic changes.
As his HRs remained stable during the rest of the admission, diltiazem was stopped at the time of discharge, to avoid excessive nodal blockade and interaction with other medications.
# CAD # CHF, chronic, systolic: No sign of volume overload on exam or CXR.
His [**Last Name (un) **] has been held recently due to relative hypotension.
These runs were likely from myocardial scar.
