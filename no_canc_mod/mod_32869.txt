Brief Hospital Course: # Takotsubo's Cardiomyopathy: At an OSH, the patient developed 10mm ST elevation anterolaterally on telemetry, confirmed by 12 lead EKG (V2-V6, I, aVR) while being transferred to a chair in the ICU.
She was asymptomatic at this time, with no chest pain.
Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] showed severe anterolateral, apical and inferoapical akinesis with an EF of 20%, consistent with Takatsubo syndrome.
A repeat TTE showed mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with mid to distal anteroseptum, anterior wall, and distal inferior wall hypokinesis, and an EF 50-55%.
A second repeat TTE later in the hospitalization showed mild symmetric LVH, mild to moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with an EF 45% and with distal LV and apical akinesis, the remaining segments are hyperdynamic.
She was initially placed on a heparin gtt as she had increased risk of thrombus formation at the akinetic segments; however, this was discontinued after she formed a right groin hematoma later in the hospitalization (see below).
**She was started on Lasix 40 mg PO daily for her edema, and this should be titrated to her edema and physical exam.
She will likely need a repeat TTE in the future to assess apical wall motion and to evaluate for thrombus.
# Respiratory Distress: During her initial hospitalization, she would trigger for desaturations to SaO2 80% on 2 L, but she improved to 96% on 5 L. CXRs were consistent with volume overload with small bilateral pleural effusions.
CXR on discharge showed persistent bilateral effusions.
# CAD: Her EKG at OSH demonstrated ST elevations in I, avL, V2-V6; Qs in II, III, aVF, V3-V6, yet the patient remained chest pain free.
She was hypertensive at this time.
The EKG changes were likely secondary to stress cardiomyopathy in the setting of PNA and SBO.
Cardiac catheterization showed normal LMCA with a 40% mid stenosis in the LAD, the LCX had mild luminmal irregularities, the RCA had a 50% mid stenosis.
# Hypotension: On day 2 of admission to [**Hospital1 18**], she became hypotensive in the CCU into the 60s after receiving one dose of Metoprolol 12.5.
At that time her CVP was [**2-27**], so this was thought to be due to volume depletion.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on Methylprednisolone -> Dexamethasone, and an AM cortisol was 18.2, which is low for acute infection, but the patient was on steroids.
She then triggered for hypotension on [**1-29**] secondary to a right groin hematoma (see below) in the setting of supratherapeutic PTT on heparin gtt and on a steroid taper.
# Right Groin Hematoma: The patient became hypotensive with SBP 68-85 on [**1-29**].
Her heparin gtt and Coumadin were discontinued as her PTT had been >150 over the previous 2 days and her INR was 2.0->5.3 on Coumadin, and there was concern for increased ecchymosis and expanding hematoma at her right cardiac catheterization site.
CT abd/pelvis showed slight interval increase in size of her right inguinal hematoma which tracked slightly into the anterolateral right thigh, continued evidence of recent intraperitoneal bleeding is most likely related to recent surgery, and no definite evidence of new intraperitoneal bleeding.
She received several hours of manual compression for her expanding hematoma.
Right femoral vascular ultrasound showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or fistula in the right groin, but did show a right groin subcutaneous hematoma.
Vascular surgery was consulted and thought the most likely cause of her hematoma was a ruptured pseudoaneurysm s/p catheterization in the setting of supratherapeutic INR and recent cardiac catheterization.
Repeat right femoral vascular U/S showed no pseudoaneurysm and a small hematoma in right groin.
# Pneumonia: The patient was admitted [**Date range (1) 77005**] to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital with bilateral upper lobe pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, her antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Zosyn when she became hypotensive with low grade fever, as there was initial concern for sepsis.
She had an elevated WBC (35.7 on admission), but this was likely the result of steroids.
A diff showed a left shift (94% neutrophils) but no bands.
Initial CXR showed bilateral upper zone infiltrates, left > right lower lobe infiltrates, and small effusions.
Repeat CXR showed bilateral upper lobe infiltrates as well as infiltrate in the right lung base and left retrocardiac region, concerning for a new hospital acquired pneumonia.
Sputum culture showed MRSA, yeast, and GNRs.
There was no evidence of perforation or necrosis on the ex lap.
KUB at [**Hospital1 18**] showed several top-normal diameter loops of small bowel and paucity of gas in the descending colon which could reflect the presence of an early or partial small-bowel obstruction.
She also had intraperitoneal free air, which was thought to be due to recent surgery.
CT abd/pelvis showed small amount of intraperitoneal bleeding and pneumoperitoneum is noted most likely related to the patient's recent surgery.
She continues to complain of [**8-4**] abdominal pain, and is being treated with Oxycontin SR and Oxycodone prn.
# Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC was persistently elevated during this hospitalization.
Sputum culture showed MRSA, yeast, and Pseudomonas.
CT abdomen/pelvis showed no evidence of abscess.
Her RIJ tip culture showed no significant growth.
All blood cultures and urine culture showed no growth.
Peripheral flow cytometry to evaluate for malignancy showed non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by leukemia/lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
# Possible Transfusion Reaction: After the patient received the first unit of PRBCs, she developed symptoms of respiratory distress, and became pale and diaphoretic.
TSH 8.7, Free T4 0.41, but this was in the setting of acute illness.
Her uncontrolled hypothyroidism was likely contributing to her hyponatremia (see below).
# COPD:  The patient was discharged from an OSH with PNA and COPD on a steroid taper.
She was placed on Solumedrol and Dexamethasone initially in the CCU for concern for adrenal insufficiency in the setting of hypotension.
Her home dose of FeSO4 tid was intially held because we didn't want to cause constipation in the setting of her SBO.
# Ulcerative Colitis: Continued Asacol 400 mg PO bid.
# Depression/Anxiety: The patient became increasingly depressed during the hospitalization, which was likely confounded be her hyponatremia and hypothyroidism.
# Skin blisters and erythema: Patient complains of severe back pain from ulcers.
# Access: PICC .
# Code: DNR/DNI .
