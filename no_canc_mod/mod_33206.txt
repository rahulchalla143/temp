Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: HPI: The pt is a 65 year-old woman (uncertain handedness) with a past medical history of a left MCA stroke in [**2142**] (residual R HP), HTN, aortic insufficiency, Atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who was rehabilitating at a facility from a recent right ankle fracture when she was noticed to be unresponsive the morning of [**9-3**].
She was estimated to have been found unresponsive at 8:15am.
She was subsequently noted to have tonic clonic shaking of the right upper and lower extremities.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient continued to seize intermittently w/o regaining alertness; her heart rate was in the 140s-150s but was also noted to have a fever of 102.4.
There is no mention of recent illness in the transfer records other than a recent right ankle fracture.
Past Medical History: PMH: Stroke left hemisphere with residual right hemiparesis ([**2142**]) HTN Aortic insufficiency Atrial Fibrillation on coumadin Right ankle fx Facial skin cancer s/p excision [**2141**].
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx.
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
Possible septal myocardial infarction.
Diffuse T wave inversion.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
CT CNS w/o Contrast: 07/ 30/ 08: There is left frontal encephalomalacia with ex vacuo dilatation of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle consistent with prior infarct.
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage, mass effect or hydrocephalus.
There is basal ganglia calcification on the right.
There is some mild cortical atrophy.
There are no fractures.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct.
Left frontal encephalomalacia and ex vacuo dilatation of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle consistent with prior infarct.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a large region of hypodensity and swelling in the distribution of the superior division of the right middle cerebral artery.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.
There is a possible right posterior cerebral artery acute infarction, but this area is obscured by artifact.
EEG: 07/ 31/ 08: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captures no clinical or electrographic seizures.
Low voltage slowing is demonstrated throughout the recording.
In addition, superimposed bursts of mixed frequency theta and delta slowing are seen over the right frontal, parietal, and temporal regions, as well as the left temporal region.
Interictal discharges were also observed in these areas; however, no sustained epileptiform activity was observed.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No ASD, or cardiac source of embolism seen.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Moderate aortic regurgitation.
07/ 31/ 08: Carotid Dupplex: 1) Occlusion of the left internal carotid artery.
2) Less than 40% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
There has been marked interval worsening since the prior study.
The bilateral PCA territories appear to be relatively preserved although there is involvement of the left superior PCA territory.
Acute infarction of the right basal ganglia are also noted.
There is approximately 7.5 mm midline shift to the left with the ipsilateral ventricular effacement.
There is early right uncal herniation.
There are old infarcts in the bilateral cerebellum.
There is an old infarction in the left frontal lobe and basal ganglia.
There is minimal reconstitution via a left patent PCOM.
There is occlusion of the right supraclinoid ICA at its bifurcation.
There is lack of flow related enhancement in the left distal vertebral artery which could reflect occlusion.
IMPRESSION: Massive bilateral ECA and MCA territory infarctions with right to left midline shift of approximately 7.5 mm.
There is lack of flow related enhancement in the left ICA both intracranially and in the cervical portion.
In addition, she signed it when she had an ankle fracture.
CT brain showed her chronic left MCA infarct and an acute infarct in the right MCA territory.
Carotid ultrasound on [**2160-9-4**] showed complete occlusion of the left ICA.
MRI brain on [**9-5**] showed massive infarcts of both anterior hemispheres and also part of the left PCA territory.
MRA brain showed occlusion of the right supraclinoid.
Medications on Admission: Calcium Carbonate -- Unknown Strength Three times daily Nifedical XL 30 mg Daily Coumadin Unknown Strength Daily Propranolol 10 mg TID Digoxin 250 mcg Daily Vitamin D 400 unit Daily [**Doctor Last Name **] Milk of Magnesia 30 cc Daily  Discharge Medications: N/A  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: The patient had a massive bilateral ischemic infarct of the anterior hemispheres and the left superior PCA territory.
