Admission Date:  [**2195-6-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-6-25**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**] Chief Complaint: Increasing Abdominal Pain, Decreased PO Intake  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none.
History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with PMH of Alzheimer's disease, bilateral inguinal hernias, BPH, constipation, bilateral heel ulcers, s/p 3 documented falls since [**2195-2-13**] presenting with increasing abdominal pain and decreased PO intake over the past week.
The patient started developing abdominal pain 6 days ago.
The pain has become increasingly severe and is diffuse in nature.
He saw his PCP yesterday and was started on enemas and magnesium citrate PO as well as cipro/flagyl to empirically cover for a GI source of infection.
The patient has been in severe pain from his bilateral heel ulcers and is on an aggressive opiate pain regimen with a minimal bowel regimen.
He is seen by a wound specialist and gets debrided once weekly with dressing changes of his wounds twice daily.
He has fallen three times in [**2195**] and has a residual hematoma on his left forehead from one of his falls.
He was noted to have a rigid abdomen and non-reducible >6 cm, hard bilateral inguinal hernias with concern for strangulation in the right scrotum.
CXR and KUB showed no evidence of free air under diaphragm.
Non contract CT of abdomen and pelvis preliminariy showed fecal loading, large inguinal hernias without evidence of obstruction or strangulation or volvulus.
Surgery was consulted and recommended no surgical intervention.
He would not answer questions appropriately but was noted to be in severe pain secondary to his heels and his abdomen.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Admission Exam: Vitals: T: 98 BP: 139/46 P: 110s-130s R: 18 O2: 94% RA General: Elderly male, somnolent, but will respond to his name HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry MM, oropharynx clear, hematoma noted on the left side of his forehead Neck: supple, JVP flat Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly CV: Irregularly irregular, tachycardic Abdomen: firm, diffusely tender, distended, hypoactive bowel sounds, no rebound tenderness or guarding GU: Foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused; Dopplerable pulses; no clubbing, cyanosis or edema; bilateral necrotic heel ulcers noted   Pertinent Results: STUDIES: CXR ([**2195-6-20**]) - IMPRESSION: 1.
No evidence of free intra-abdominal air.
Small right pleural effusion.
Massive amount of stool within mildly dilated large bowel.
2. herniated loops of bowel at the right inguinal region.
Dilated loops of small bowel seen on the lateral decubitus views, could be due to a focal ileus or early obstruction.
No evidence of free air.
Massive bowel-containing inguinal hernias without definite evidence for obstruction or ischemia although the right hernia in particular is probably at risk for torsion potentially in the future.
Marked fecal impaction in the rectal vault.
Porceline gallbladder with cholelithiasis, generally considered to represent a substantial risk of developing gallbladder cancer.
Small right pleural effusion with asymmetric right pulmonary interlobular septal thickening which could represent asymmetric edema or an inflammatory process in the right lung, although if patient has history of primary malignancy, differential consideration includes lymphangiocarcinomatosis.
If acute pulmonary symptoms are clinically present, a PA/Lateral chest radiograph is recommended.
Mild bilateral hydronephrosis with hydroureter on the left without definite source.
One possibility is that the degree of fecal impaction is so great as to induce extrinsic compression.
Renal ultrasound following fecal disimpaction may be potentially helpful to see if the renal findings improve.
Diffuse severe atherosclerotic disease.
[**2195-6-22**] TTE: Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 3 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-2-17**], the rhythm still appears to be atrial fibrillation.
There is no longer a gradient across the outflow tract.
Soft tissue swelling involving both right and left feet.
No cortical interruption of discrete lytic lesion detected.
Left calcaneus -- No obvious calcaneal bone destruction is detected to confirm the presence of osteomyelitis, but the ulcer does lie in close proximity of the bone.
Right 5th proximal phalanx -- focal ostepenia, ?
In the absence of overlying soft tissue infection, this would most likely represent an enchondroma.

Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]M h/o alzheimer's dementia and BPH admitted with 1 week of increasing abdominal pain and found to have severe diffuse fecal loading with massive inguinal hernias containing loops of colon as well as acute kidney injury.
# abdominal pain / constipation / impaction -  pt's abdominal pain was felt to likely be secondary to constipation, given his imaging with severe diffuse fecal loading and massive inguinal hernias containing loops of colon.
He also underwent manual disimpaction, which revealed hard trace guaiaic positive stools.
He continued to have daily bowel movements, his abdomen became soft, and the loops of bowel in the scrotum became notable soft.
# acute kidney injury / urinary retention - Patient was noted to have a creatinine of 1.9 from a baseline of 0.5.
It was felt that the patient's diffuse fecal loading was causing an element of obstruction and that his decreased PO intake was leading to a component of prerenal azotemia.
# leukocytosis - etiology was initially felt possibly [**3-17**] UTI versus heel ulcers.
After discussion with podiatry, heel infection was felt less likely, and vancomycin was discontinued.
His leukocytosis resolved with treatment of UTI and constipation.
# bilateral heel ulcers - The patient had necrotic areas overlying both heels which were draining fibrinous material initially concerning for infection.
He had a documented history of MRSA at his nursing facility from a heel swab on [**5-31**] and was reporedly undergoing weekly debridements there.
IV vancomycin was started empirically on admission, and podiatry service was consulted, who felt there was no evidence of infection.
Foot XRAY was obtained which raised concern for possible osteomyeletis, however, after discussion with podiatry, this was felt unlikely.
ESR was 17, and CRP was 85, however felt there was contribution from UTI and constipation.
# altered mental status - the patient has Alzheimer's disease at baseline and the family had noted a marked decrease in his functional status since [**2195-2-13**] when he was hospitalized for a fall.
With treatment of his constipation, and UTI, his mental status slowly improved, though he remained A&Ox2, his son's corroborated that he was approaching his baseline.
# atrial fibrillation - pt has no previous record of atrial fibrillation.
Should he have elevated heart rates, he can be started on low dose metoprolol, which can be uptitrated as needed.
# BPH - Home doxazosin was held on admission given hypotension, and resumed prior to discharge.
# hypokalemia - pt with K=3.0 prior to discharge, this was repleted without difficulty.
he should have repeat potassium checked on 1d after discharge, and repleted as needed, for goal K>3.7 given atrial fibrillation above.
# hyperglycemia - no h/o diabetes, mildly elevated FSBS in ICU, A1c 6.8.  not requiring insulin on floor.
# CODE - DNR/DNI.
