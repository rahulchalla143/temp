Underlying consolidation is not excluded.
Mild CHF.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal inferior and inferoseptum hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
CT ABD/PELVIS: Large bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe compressive atelectasis.
No consolidation or pneumothorax.
No bowel dilatation, pneumatosis, or intra-abdominal free air to suggest bowel ischemia.
Diffuse aortic valvular, mitral annulus, and coronary artery calcification with moderate cardiomegaly and probable mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Pleural calcification and thickening suggests prior asbestos exposure.
Thoracolumbar degenerative changes with facet joint disease in the lower lumbar and lumbosacral spine, benign right iliac bone island, and healed left inferior pubic ramus fracture of unknown chronicity.
EGD: Esophagitis Blood in the esophagus Abnormal mucosa in the stomach PEG tube site without any evidence of bleeding.
Old blood clot washed away with saline.
No evidence of active bleeding.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: 88 y/o F with PMHx of CAD, DM, Atrial Fib, Alzheimers, CVA in [**5-12**] on coumadin who was found unresponsive and bradycardic, INR of 10 and active upper/lower GI bleeds who was transferred from [**Hospital 8**] hospital intubated and on pressors, EGD showed reflux esophagitis also [**Last Name (un) **] and NSTEMI.
Pt was found esophagitis on EGD and this was felt to be the etiology of her GIB.
Pt did not have further bleeding with her INR <2.
She was also found to have NSTEMI c peak troponin of 0.39 which was managed conservatively.
Pt was admitted in respiratory failure, and found to have a MRSA pneumonia (treated c 2week course of vancomycin), felt to possibly be [**1-6**] aspiration while down (in this frequently hospitalized and nursing home pt), further pt had been resuscitated aggresively and was found to be volume overloaded on exam.
Throughout this time pt had experienced occasional atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response which was treated with metoprolol IV as pt had NSTEMI on admission and it was felt that heart rates >120s might induce further demand ischemia.
On [**2172-8-24**], while on hemodialysis session #4 (approx 1 hr into HD) pt became bradycardic and a code was called.
