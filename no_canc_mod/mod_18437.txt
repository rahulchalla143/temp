Course: This is a 58 year-old Male who initially presented with 3-days of left forearm swelling, redness and pain associatd with fevers for one day.
He noted the onset of bilateral axilla erythema for 2-weeks after having upper respiratory symptoms including congestion and cough.
Three days prior to presentation, the patient developed severe left arm pain and erythema, targeting elbow and forearm, associated with intermittent paresthesias of the left hand.
He then reported the onset of high fever, nausea and vomiting on the night prior to arrival.
He presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where his labs were notable for a lactate of 7.2, he had evidence of mild renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.8 and a WBC to 27.5.
CT of the extremity was performed which showed deep fascial edema concerning for impending compartment symdrome, without gas.
He did, however, develop intermittent, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation following his first surgical procedure with rapid ventricular repsonse refractory to medical treatment initially with Lopressor and Diltiazem.
He had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation from POD#[**5-22**].
The patient had no episodes of desaturation or pulmonary concerns.
The patient denied cough or respiratory symptoms.
The patient experienced no nausea or vomiting.
The patient's creatinine was 1.8, with evidence of acute renal insufficiency on admission, however, this improved with adequate hydration.
The patient had no evidence of bleeding from their incision.
ID: The patient was admitted with concerns of acute compartment syndrome versus necrotizing fasciitis.
His arm remained elevated, in a volar resting splint and sling, in an elevated position at all times.
The patient also had sequential compression boot devices in place during immobilization to promote circulation.
You had an occurrence of atrial fibrillation while an inpatient, and you are being discharged on Lopressor.
You may take your prescribed pain medication for moderate to severe pain.
You may switch to Tylenol or Extra Strength Tylenol for mild pain as directed on the packaging.
Take prescription pain medications for pain not relieved by tylenol.
Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking any narcotic pain medication.
