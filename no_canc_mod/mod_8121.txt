# HEMOPTYSIS - 2x/12h of ~ [**11-26**] cup of hemoptysis.
Additionally, pt could have another etiology for hemoptysis as more bleeding would be expected from an aortopulmonary fistula.
The differential diagnosis is long esp bronchiectasis in this pt w/ hx of recurrent asp pna, TB (given his NHR status), PE, bronchitis, pulm AVM, bronchogenic ca (chronic retrocardiac opacity concerning for post-obstructive lung collapse), and pna.
Hct 38---31 at 1:00pm - appreciate CT surgery input - admit to ICU for BP control and closer monitoring - plan for bronchoscopy to evaluate site of bleeding - epistaxis not completely ruled out as a cause for "hemoptysis"  - plant PPD: not coughing - con't levo for h/o quinolone sensitive UTI - con't hold anticoagulants - BP control - hold antihypertensives for BP <130 given worry re: bleeding - s/p T&Cross, 2PIV's .
# FEVER - likely UTI given prior + Urine cultures for hightly-resistent pseudomonas (was only sensitive to [**Month/Day (2) **]/Gent/[**Last Name (un) **].
Finished 2 week course of Levo 250 during last admission)Was finishing course of Augmentin and Bactrium for "UTI" -Try to get cultre data at NH for this UTI - c/w Levo renal dosed.
Will add Vanc if fever/leukocytosis returns and zosyn.
Asthma: C/W PRN Ipr/Albuterol .
No further episodes of hemoptysis and remained hemodynamically stable overnight.
Given his presentation, lack of further HCT decline or bleeding, and stable CT scan of aorta, felt that hemoptysis was best explained by tongue [**Last Name (un) 20694**] event or epitaxis and not herald bleed of a bronchial-aortic fistula.
Given his poor functional status and proceedureal risk, bronchoscopy was defered.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hemoptysis from epistaxis v. tongue bite.
