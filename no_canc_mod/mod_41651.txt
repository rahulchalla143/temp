Head incision C/D/I  Pertinent Results: MRI Brain [**2132-7-2**]: Large extra-axial heterogeneous collection overlying the entire left hemisphere likely represents a complex, multi-aged subdural hematoma, with a large multiloculated component filling the left middle cranial fossa with posterior and superior displacement of the temporal lobe with mass effect as detailed above.
It is unclear to what extent there may be underlying left anterior temporal encephalomalacia.
The majority of enhancement is thin peripheral and dural-based, with a more focal plaque-like and nodular area of enhancement overlying one of the cystic cavities which is most likely reactive, and an underlying is unlikely.
Prominent cisterna magna with hypoplastic vermis in the spectrum of Dandy-Walker variant is also noted.
Status post left frontotemporal craniotomy for evacuation of left subdural collection with interval increase in acute subdural blood within the left temporal convexity and temporal fossa compared to the prior study.
Moderate amount of pneumocephalus within the bifrontal and left temporal regions causing slightly more prominent gyral and sulcal effacement.
Unchanged hyperdense material pools around the catheter, compatible with hemorrhage from procedure.
The degree of pneumocephalus is similar, small in the left frontal region and small-to-moderate in the right frontal region.
Residual left subdural fluid and blood is stable in extent.
The left temporal lobe remains displaced posteriorly with sulcal effacement.
A 3-mm rightward shift of midline structures is unchanged.
CT head [**7-6**]: No significant interval change.
Per the family, he was starting to exhibit signs of dementia prior to this medical event/admission.
