She was recently admitted 6/7-9 for acute renal failure secondary to overdiuresis and supratherapeutic INR.
She now presents with left-sided, substernal chest pain of 12 hours duration.
She reports that the pain started yesterday at 10 pm.
She described it as "heaviness" without radiation associated with SOB and mild nausea.
The pain was not associated with eating or exertion.
She is not sure if it feels like the chest pain that she has in the past but does not think it feels like her CHF pain.
On arrival to ED, still with 2/10 CP which eventually resolved with NTG.
Patient became transiently and asymptomatically hypotensive to 73/36 and bradycardic in the ED, attributed to the nitroglycerin, which resolved with IV fluid bolus to SBP's in 110's.
Currently she is chest pain free with SBP's in 110's.
EKG with <0.5mm questionable ST depression in V4-V6.
Atrial fibrillation status post DCCV on [**2133-3-18**] and again on [**2134-3-23**] (still in AF) - chronically on coumadin.
Diastolic congestive heart failure.
Hemodynamic evaluation revealed moderately to severely elevated right-sided pressures (mean RA was 17 and RVEDP was 22 mmHg), severely elevated left-sided pressures (mean PCW was 29 and LVEDP was 31), and severely elevated pulmonary pressures (PA was 67/33 mmHg).
There were prominent V waves on the PA tracing up to 50 mmHg, 2+MR.
CAD:  s/p PCI of the proximal LAD on [**2130-2-23**], then had NSTEMI and in-stent restenosis treated with PTCA [**2134-4-26**] and PTCA of mid-LAD 70% lesion (cypher stents x2) 6.
