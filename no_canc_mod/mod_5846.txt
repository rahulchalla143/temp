HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82 year-old Russian speaking male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy who presented with bright red blood per rectum upon waking from sleep at 1:30 a.m. on the morning of admission.
He denied any belly pain or diarrhea.
He had no previous history of a GI bleed.
He does endorse a history of constipation.
There is a question of a history of a colonoscopy in the past, but this is remote.
He was admitted to the MICU for 1 liter output of rectal bleeding in the Emergency Room.
Atrial fibrillation status post pacer in [**2159**].
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction with a coronary artery bypass graft and a recent positive stress test per Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, he was a pleasant Russian speaking male lying in bed in no acute distress.
No carotid bruits.
Heart was irregular irregular with a grade 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur.
Lungs revealed mild crackles at the right base.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Gastrointestinal bleed:  He was initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for large rectal bleeding output.
The results of an early nuclear scan for bleeding showed findings consistent with a cecal bleed.
He was sent to interventional radiology for further diagnostic evaluation for localizing the site of the bleed and had a selective mesenteric angiogram.
The patient was found to have active bleeding from the branch of the ileocolic artery, which was selectively embolized with four 2 mm by 2 cm coils with cessation of active extravasation of contrast.
He was transfused 2 more units to support his anemia to a hematocrit of 25% and was called out to the floor when his bleeding stabilized.
He was also seen by surgery who was concerned for ischemia of the embolized segment.
For this reason the gastroenterology team also agreed that a colonoscopy would place the patient at a higher risk for perforation of the segment of the colon, which was effaced by ileocolic artery embolization.
He did endorse a couple of episodes of small dark spotted blood with his bowel movements, but none of these resulted in a drop in his hematocrit.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2169-1-28**] who had the patient go for a nuclear stress test, which revealed a moderate reversible perfusion defect in the anterior wall and anterior portion of the apex that was consistent with stress induced ischemia.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] saw the patient while he was in house, recommending that the patient have his acute GI issues settle out before doing a cardiac catheterization at the end of [**Month (only) 958**].
He did not complain of any active chest pain.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient continued to do well from a congestive heart failure point of view.
He also had his pacemaker interrogated after having bradycardia down to the 30s one evening without pacemaker capturing.
Diabetes:  The patient was continued on regular insulin sliding scale instead of his oral hypoglycemics due to his diet changes in preparation for procedures.
Atrial fibrillation with pacemaker.
Coronary artery disease with a history of coronary artery bypass graft in myocardial infarction.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Acute blood loss anemia from gastrointestinal bleeding, status post ileocecal artery branch embolization in [**2169-2-25**].
