Patient was at home with increasing respiratory symptoms (productive cough, fever) X 3 days.
She reports that he became pulseless in the car.
On the ED physician's initial evaluation, the patient was noted to be cyanotic, unresponsive with very low respirations, and without a pulse.
With bagging, reportedly his cyanosis improved as did his bradycardia and blood pressure.
After intubated, copious amounts of greenish sputum were suctioned.
Central venous access was placed (right subclavian) and the patient was placed on dopamine with increase in blood pressures to 120s-130s systolic.
He was previously on home oxygen which was recently reinstituted at 1 L/min at night   Past Medical History: HTN hypercholesterolemia NQWMI ca.

There is widening of the mediastinum, likely due to underlying body habitus and aortic tortuosity.
No definite consolidation is noted, however, subtle increased density is seen along the lateral aspects of the right lung, likely due to overlying soft tissue.
In the more superior aspect, there is an abnormal density resembling a reverse "P" which may be extrinsic to the patient.
Minimal left basilar atelectasis is also evident.
No definite effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Otherwise, stable radiographic appearance of the chest with left lower lobe atelectasis.
The pulmonary opacification seen in both lungs predominantly at the lung bases has decreased with better identification of the pulmonary vessels.
The pulmonary arteries are prominent in keeping with patient's pulmonary arterial hypertension.
There is no pleural effusion.
Gradual decrease of the volume overload.
[**4-21**] portable CXR: The patient has been extubated showing persistent interstitial opacities seen in both lungs.
No newly occurred parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax are noted.
Stable radiographic findings including interstitial opacities in both lungs, stable mild cardiomegaly, status post extubation.
No focal consolidation.
He was initially continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, levofloxacin, vancomycin), vanc d/c'd on [**4-18**], cefepime d/c'd on [**4-20**] as sputum culture came back pneumococcus sensitive to levofloxacin.
He was extubated on [**4-20**] without complication.
He had acute renal failure which resolved with fluids.
# PNA/COPD/Respiratory failure: Likely related to underlying poor pulmonary status (COPD) and pneumonia.
he idd have one episode of hypoxia that was thought to be due to mucus plugging and resolved quickly.
# Acute renal failure: Likely was volume depleted versus ATN in setting of sepsis.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.

You also had an episode of hypoxiz while on the floor which was likely due to a mucus plug.
