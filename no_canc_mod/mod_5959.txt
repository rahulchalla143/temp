She was discharged with the finding of a new pulmonary nodule, and returns concerned about that nodule and the possiblility that it might be malignant.
She says that her chest pain is near her right breast, stabbing, radiates straight through to her back.
She has shortness of breath associated with the chest pain.
These symptoms started suddenly on [**11-23**] when she was in [**Location (un) 5354**], right after she exited the plane.
She says she has had associated sweating, occasional palpitations.
Additionally, she has had persistent nausea over the last few days and complains of loose stools since during the last admission, with up to 7 bowel movements per day.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED she was given ativan 0.5 mg for nausea and put on oxygen.

She also has an aunt who had a history of some blood clots, although specifics are unknown.

Shortness of breath.
Left ventricular function.
Dilated IVC (>2.5 cm), with minimal respiratory variation c/w elevated RA pressure of >20 mmHg.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Markedly dilated RV cavity.
Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Abnormal septal motion/position consistent with RV  pressure/volume overload.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views.
Based on [**2173**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis (relative preservation of the apex/[**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign).
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Marked right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension c/w primary pulmonary process (pulmonary embolism, etc.).
Based on [**2173**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
[**Location (un) **] PHYSICIAN:     Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 46 year old woman with PMH of cocaine use and recent intubation, DVT, PE and spiculated mass per CT presents with persistent chest pain and shortness of breath.
Persistent shortness of breath Ruled out for PE per CTA.
CXR done [**12-4**] - small right pleural effusions, pulmonary nodules, perihilar lymph nodes.
She was diuresed gently and tolerated this well- we felt she had reached euvolemia and so this was stopped.
Workup for PE was negative.
A PA catheter was placed, which showed severe pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 100/50.
Despite initiating inhaled NO therapy, the patient became bradycardic and progressively more hypoxic.
By CT, 1.6 x 1.3 cm spiculated mass in the posterior aspect of the left upper lobe, lymphadenopathy.
Bilateral emphysematous changes, right-sided pleural effusion.
h/o DVT/PE &#8211; Pt did not achieve therapeutic INR despite Coumadin and so Lovenox was started [**7-25**].
