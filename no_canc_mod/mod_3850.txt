HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old male, Russian-speaking only, with history of Parkinson's disease, depression, and colon cancer presenting with new-onset left sided pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and new atrial fibrillation.
The patient presented to the emergency department with concern for pulmonary embolism.
The patient, shortly, thereafter, became hypotensive and unresponsive.
The head CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
However, the patient's hypotension was thought to be more likely secondary to Metoprolol with exaggerated response, The patient also had an echocardiogram that revealed a pericardial effusion.
There was no evidence of tamponade physiology.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy 3.
Depression with psychosis.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Colon cancer status post hemicolectomy two years ago.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
There was no evidence of pulsus paradoxus.
GENERAL: The patient was a fairly well appearing elderly male in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Examination revealed EOMI, PERRLA, slightly dry mucous membranes.
There was no lymphadenopathy.
CARDIAC:  Examination revealed irregularly irregular rhythm with normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
EXTREMITY:  Examination revealed no edema.
RECTAL: Examination revealed good anal tone and guaiac negative.
Chest x-ray revealed no failure and left basilar atelectasis that was improving.
Head CT:  No acute intracranial pathologic process.
Chest CT:  Bilateral small pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, left lower lobe atelectasis, no PE.
On [**2157-4-14**], echocardiogram revealed left atrial enlargement, right atrial enlargement, concentric LVH, EF greater than 55%, RVH trace AR and trace MR, moderate loculated pericardial effusion and no echocardiogram evidence of tamponade.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 86-year-old man with history of depression, colon cancer, who presented with new-onset chest pain and hypotension.
The patient was found to have pericardial effusion.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient presented with chest pain and hypotension.
He was found to have a pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.
Apparently, the episode of hypotension was felt to be secondary to an exaggerated response to Metoprolol.
He ruled out for myocardial infarction.
The patient developed new atrial fibrillation thought to be secondary to his pericarditis.
The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response was initially stable, but then he developed a rate into the 140s to 160s.
Repeat EKG was done, which revealed atrial fibrillation in the 70s, leftward axis, normal [**Doctor Last Name 1754**], intervals.
ST segment elevation of 1-mm in lead 2, biphasic T in V2, and T wave flattening in lead 3.
When compared to an earlier [**2157-4-14**] EKG, there were no significant changes.
GENITOURINARY:  The patient has history of benign prostatic hypertrophy, maintained on Flomax and Cardura.
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient has history of Parkinson's disease maintained on Sinemet.
PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient has a history of depression with psychosis, maintained on Seroquel.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient has history of constipation treated with Senna, Dulcolax, Fleet, and Colace.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Depression with psychosis.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Colon cancer status post hemicolectomy two years ago.
