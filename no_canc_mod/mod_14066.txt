CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with acute onset confusion, rule out mass or encephalitis.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images obtained before gadolinium.
FINDINGS: There has been no significant interval change seen.
Subtle hyperintensities in the white matter are again noted indicating minimal changes of small vessel disease.
No midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus seen.
Following gadolinium no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement seen.
No evidence of acute infarct seen or slow diffusion identified to indicate encephalitis.
IMPRESSION: Minimal changes of small vessel disease.
No abnormal enhancement or mass effect.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 year old man with history of HIV, diabetes, presenting with acute altered mental status, combative, without clear source of infection.

CT head negative for acute process.
Given h/o vomiting an acute GI process is in differential as well.
Acyclovir was started and continued overnight for risk of HSV encephalitis.
And given low suspicion for bacterial meningitis will held vanc/ctx, and not covered for Listeria meningitis.
Given the normal brain MRI and normal CSF cell count, there was low suspicion for a positive HSV PCR on discharge, although the result remained pending.
Renally dosed truvada during acute renal failure, but discharged on his previous dose after renal function recovered.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Unclear etiology of nephropathy, likely diabetic given h/o microabluminuria.
