Improved but mildly persistent chronic phlegmon with few residual foci of intrinsic air noted extending from the inferior stomach antrum towards the anterior abdominal wall with decreased amount of intrinsic, but extraperitoneal air in this phlegmonous change.
Nonspecific new foci of air within the hilum of the right pelvic kidney transplant which could be iatrogenic from foley catheterization, however, underlying infection cannot be excluded.
New central left upper lobe and right lower lobe airspace consolidation with near complete resolution of the left lower lobe airspace consolidation.
Probable loculated right pleural effusion.
[**2184-9-6**] EGD :  Moderate erythema and scattered ulceration in mid esophagus.
Retained fluids in stomach Scattered erosions in body of the stomach consistent with NG tube trauma.
Small mucosal defect in D1 at site of surgical anastomosis.
Remainder of duodenal mucosa normal.
The lungs appear better ventilated than at the previous examination and the pre-existing signs suggestive of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema have decreased in severity in the interval.
However, small bilateral pleural effusions persist.
In the well ventilated areas of the lung parenchyma, there is no evidence of new parenchymal opacities.
[**2184-9-29**] Post pyloric FT placement :  Successful repositioning of Dobbhoff tube into the post-pyloric position.
There is no pelvi-infundibular thickening.
There is no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.
The resistive indices of the intrarenal arteries range from 0.75-0.77, mildly elevated but improved, previously ranging from 0.85-0.87.
Known prior gastric perforation, with improved right rectus sheath collection, but persistent sinus with mild enlargement of a small gas and fluid-containing collection anteroineferior to the pylorus.
No evidence for active leak.
Mild dilation of the proximal small bowel loops measuring up to 2.9 cm with decompression of the distal loops without focal transition; a partial small-bowel obstruction is a condieration though a single site can not be identified.
Extensive abdominal aortic atherosclerosis.
Moderate-sized right pleural effusion with compressive right basilar atelectasis, slightly worse.
Right lower lobe dependent opacity associated with bronchial occlusion is likely due to atelectasis secondary to mucus plugging.
Coexisting infection cannot be excluded.
Small right pleural effusion.
Mildly enlarged heterogeneous thyroid gland is incompletely imaged.
Pulmonary arterial enlargement likely secondary to pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Unchanged right rectus sheath air collection with suspected antral/antropyloric fistula with associated ill-defined area of soft tissue in the adjacent transverse mesocolon.
Minimally thickened gallbladder wall and possible small gallstones are not diagnostic for acute gallbladder disease, however if clinical suspicion exists, a right upper quadrant ultrasound would be helpful for further evaluation.
Extensive abdominal aortic atherosclerosis.
Unchanged right basilar atelectasis with small right pleural effusion.
No findings suggestive of osteomyelitis.
L4-L5: Multifactorial narrowing of the subarticular zones and neural foramina, with impingement upon the traversing L5 and the exiting L4 nerve roots, respectively.
In the ED he had a his chest xray had new LUL opacities and RLL opacities concerning for pneumonia.
He had an NGT placed with rapid outflow on about 1 liter of bilious fluid.
He was seen by transplant for his epigastric pain who recommended a CT of the torso which showed new central left upper lobe and right lower lobe airspace consolidation with near complete resolution of the left lower lobe airspace consolidation and probable loculated right pleural effusion as well as improved but mildly persistent chronic phlegmon with few residual foci of intrinsic air noted extending from the inferior stomach antrum towards the anterior abdominal wall with decreased amount of intrinsic, but extraperitoneal air in this phlegmonous change.
His INR was supratherapeutic so it was reversed with FFP and Vitamin K. Transplant surgery recommended EGD to rule out a perforation in the area of his previous perforated duodenal ulcer.
His heparin gtt was held in anticipation for bronchoscopy however he did not get bronched until HD3 which revealed significant mucopurulent secretions throughout the airway with mucous plugs and moderate supraglottic edema.
BAL cultures were sent which showed no growth.
EGD to evaluate his epigastric pain was planned but was difficult to coordinate due to his need for anesthesia and potential respiratory instability.
On HD 4 he had an episode of desaturation to the upper 80's which improved with suctioning.
On HD 5 he was no longer reporting abdominal pain so his NGT was discontinued.
Because his Cr continued to remain elevated on HD 7 he was started on a bicarb drip.
His trach was capped after which he experienced an episode of desaturation on room air which improved with uncapping and trach mask.
Bronchoscopy found thick whitish yellow secretion in the trachea and bilateral lungs, more on the right side.
Therapeutic aspiration was performed and a washing found commensal respiratory flora.
EGD found moderate erythema and scattered ulceration in mid esophagus, scattered erosions in body of the stomach consistent with NG tube trauma, and a small mucosal defect in D1 at site of the prior surgical anastomosis.
He was also noted to have what was thought to be increased psychomotor retardation likely secondary to depression.
Psychiatry was consulted and had no new recommendations.
He continued to have copious secretions requiring suctioning throughout the day.
On HD 10 he was triggered for unresponsiveness and inability to cooperated with an exam.
ABG revealed a metabolic acidosis with hypoxia and he was transferred to the SICU where his blood gas and respiratory status improved on BiPAP.
Neurology was consulted thought that his symptoms were more fitting with a metabolic disturbance rather than cerebrovascular in origin.
Though his respiratory status was somewhat improved he continued to have altered mentation and an elevated Cr so on HD 11 he [**Hospital1 1834**] hemodialysis.
Chest xray showed slightly enlarging bilateral plural effusions so on HD 12 he [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] bronchoscopy which noted significant supraglottic edema.
Significant mucus plugs were seen in the distal airways which were removed.
He was complaining of difficulty swallowing which was thought to be related to his supraglottic edema so he was restarted on tube feeds through his NGT.
On HD 15 his cefepime was stopped with a plan to reculture him if he spiked a fever or if his WBC increased.
He was seen by ENT for his supraglottic edema and laryngoscopy at the bedside showed mild epiglottic and arytenoid edema.
On HD 18 he had an episode of desaturation to the 60's overnight which improved with trach mask.
He was noted to have bilateral lung opacities on CXR.
Because of his episode of desaturation and his known prior positional occlusion of his tracheal button, his warfarin was held and his button was exchanged with IP for a tracheostomy tube.
He was also ordered for chest PT with a therapeutic shaking vest to help clear his secretions however he refused its use.
Over the next several days TF advanced to goal at an increased caloric density/reduced volume after experiencing some nausea and multiple attempts were made to wean him off of the vent, however each time he was transitioned to the trach mask he became tachypneic requiring that he be put back on pressure support.
It was thought that these episodes were due to anxiety so psychiatry was asked to weigh in.
He was stable on the floor on a trach mask and on HD 27 he was noted to have a Hct of 21.5 which was thought to be secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
On HD 28 he was set up with an inexsufflator which he was to use daily, with moderate success.
On HD 32 his tube feeds were cycled over 18 hours rather than given continuously because he was complaining of vague abdominal pain.
Over the next several days his tube feeds were switched from cycling to continuous and the back to an 18 hour cycle in an effort to help with his vague abdominal pain.
He continued to have problems with hyperkalemia, requiring occasional kayexelate.
The renal service followed him closely and did a battery of blood work and urine assays.
His blood sugars were also elevated to the 300 range as he took both tube feedings and and a diabetic diet.
(*********CURRENT THROUGH OF [**2184-10-3**]*********)  The patient was transferred to the medicine service for management of his hyperkalemia and hyperglycemia and a summary of his medical issues after his transfer are detailed below.
The source of his hyperkalemia was unclear.
It was largely thought that most his elevated potassium levels were related to both his dietary intake and also his heparin injections.
His elevated tacro can also cause a mild hyperkalemia.
We also attempted to fix his acidemia with NaHCO3 tablets.
After making some of these adjustments (he remained persistently acidemic) his potassium level normalized and was slightly elevated to 5.4.
# IDDM/hyperglycemia: When the patient was transferred to our service his FSG were persistently elevated.
Going through his medications, there were not medications that elevated his potassium and we made sure that all IV medications were mixed in normal saline and not D5W as they often are.
Later in his stay, he had elevated sugars of unclear etiology.
During that period it was discovered he had a pseudomonal UTI.
# Leukocytosis/thrombocytosis:  When the patient was transferred to our service he had a reactive thrombocytosis, but his white count was normal.
In the setting of uncontrolled hyperglycemia and a reactive thrombocytosis for 4 days, we were concerned for an infection.
Two days after transfer, he developed a white count and a U/A was sent off, stool cultures were sent and patient had a CXR.
His RLE wound was also a potential source.
He had other reasons for a leukocytosis and it was not clear the leukocytosis was related to an infection.
Blood cultures were sent and negative and histoplasma and CMV were also sent and returned negative.
When the final reads of the images came back and did not reveal an intrabdominal process or osteo of the sacrum, the vancomycin and flagyl was discontinued.
The patient is thought to have a neurogenic bladder and the plan initially was for long term foley placement.
# S/p Gastric perforation in [**Month (only) **] and repair:  He has a persistent phlegmon anterior to the site of his repaired ulcer.
It has a persistent sinus tract and could be a nidus for infection, but repeated imaging on multiple occasions reveals stable to slightly improving phlegmon.
# Pressure ulcers: Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] has multiple pressure ulcers.
Despite frequent turning, he developed a right scapular pressure ulcer that has healed well.
He also has a decubitus ulcer and a RLE lateral shin ulcer (he sits in a frog leg position).
With regards to his RLE ulcer, it was healing well with pink granulation tissue, but the patient had pneumoboots on at the time of transfer.
The pressure of the pneumoboots caused a hematoma to develop around the ulcer.
We continued aggressive wound care and he had multipodius boots on bilaterally.
Despite daily dressing changes and offloading the weight of the RLE, he developed a surface eschar over the wound.
Surgery came to debride the wound and it was stage II/III with pink granulation tissue under the eschar.
As for his coccyx ulcer it has progressed since he was transferred to medicine.
The patient began having multiple bowel movements and it was hard to keep the stool out of the wound.
# ESRD s/p renal transplant: Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] was admitted with a creatinine of 2.2.
He was given fluids and blood (as described below) for intravascular volume and his creatinine resolved.
Given his anemia and concern for anemia of chronic inflammation and also low epo levels, he was started on EPO 4,000 3x/week and also transfused as needed.
# Pulmonary secretions/dyspnea:  The patient was initially admitted on [**2184-8-30**] for increased secretions, respiratory distress and hypoxia.
He was felt to have a multifocal pneumonia and was given a course of vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin.
On bronchoscopy and repeated imaging he does have chronic mucous plugging in the RLL.
He had persistent secretions and was given guaifenesin w/ codeine on a PRN basis as a mucolytic.
We used humidified air with the trach mask to also help with airway passage into the lungs.
Respiratory therapy saw him regularly and he does have significant secretions, but there is also an anxiety component to his dyspnea.
He was started on clonazepam 0.25mg PO BID for anxiety and he is also written for ativan on a PRN basis.
# Anemia:  Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] had persistent anemia throughout his admission, requiring multiple blood transfusions.
His guaiac have been negative and he has known renal disease and was started on EPO 4,000 units 3x/week.
He also has anemia of chronic inflammation.
There were no signs of hemolysis onlaboratory values.
His calcium normalized, but when corrected with his low albumin (3.0), it was still mildly elevated.
# H/o right IJ thrombosis and CVA: Patient is being anticoagulated with warfarin.
On 6mg, he had a rapid rise in his INR and so his INR was lowered to 5mg the day prior to discharge.
He will be discharged on 5mg and will need a repeat INR on [**2184-10-24**] and need to adjust his dose based on his level  # Anxiety/depressions: Given his prolonged hospital stays and clinical deterioration over the last 5 months, the patient is notable very depressed and anxious.
Hopefully when he is discharged his strengths steadily improves at the LTACH and his mood improves when his symptoms resolves.
We tried decreasing his tube feeds in order to create a situation where he would be hungry and want to eat, but this resulted in poor calorie intake and his tube feeds were started again.
His catscans were negative for obstruction.
- Next INR check on [**2184-10-24**] and adjust coumadin as needed  VOLUME STATUS: - Monitor his fluid status closely.
If concerned for dehydration or BUN/Cr rising on labs, would give 1L NS - Make sure he is taking his Sodium Bicarbonate  ANTIBIOTICS: - Cefepime 1gm Q12H until [**2184-11-2**]  GENERAL CARE: - Straight Cath Q6H - Wound care daily - frequent turning Q2H - Will need aggressive PT and OT - Chest Physical therapy - Continued suctioning and trach care - Tube Feeds unless patient is able to be transitioned to PO or agrees to G-tube - need to follow up on his beta glucan - If FSG are persistently elevated would have endocrine come to see him  DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: - Would increase clonazepam to 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] if patient is requiring a lot of ativan - Consider psych consult if patient is not participating in care - Social worker and case managers to follow closely - Needs lots of encouragement.
