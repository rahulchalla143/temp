Admission Date:  [**2129-2-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-2-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-6-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxic respiratory failure, R hip fracture  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p ORIF of R hip  History of Present Illness: 78 yo male w/ hx of COPD on home O2 (5-6 L, w/ O2 sats in mid 80s) who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] following a respiratory arrest.
Patient was first seen at OSH following a fall on his R hip, initial read of plain film was neg for fracture.
CXR w/ bilateral lower lobe opacities so he was started on levofloxacin, vancomycin, and flagyl.
It was unclear if the pneumonia was the sole cause of such severe hypoxia.
Given hypotension and hypoxia, there was concern that he may have a PE.
Patient was briefly on a heparin gtt for presumed PE but this was stopped prior to transfer.
On a CTA done in [**2125**], there was note of an anomalous left pulmonary vein which connects to the left brachiocephalic vein.

Diffuse alveolar airspace opacity within the right mid- and lower lung zones is concerning for a diffuse pneumonia, although aspiration or asymmetric pulmonary edema are also diagnostic considerations.
L4 compression fracture.
Severe emphysema.
Left lower lobe pneumonia.
Possible three other small areas of infection in the right lung but neoplastic origin of this finding cannot be excluded.
Known left upper lobe anomalous venous drainage into left brachiocephalic vein; thus the central line is in the pulmonary venous system .
Coronary calcifications and aortic valve calcifications, unchanged.
Stable hypodense liver lesion is most likely cysts.
Total collapse of the left lower lobe with obstruction of the left lower lobe bronchus most likely due to mucus plugging given the short interval of appearance, less likely due to compression or endobronchial lesion.
Moderate - severe emphysema.
Focal nodular areas in the right lung should be reevaluated after pulmonary edema resolves, neoplastic origin cannot be totally excluded.
Coronary calcifications and aortic valve calcifications, unchanged.
**   Brief Hospital Course: Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient arrived from OSH intubated; when trying to leave the OSH he had an hypoxic respiratory event which required emergency intubation.
His respiratory failure was multifactorial; pneumonia and severe COPD were the most prominent factors during this event.
Additionally, patient had evidence of L --> R shunt given anomalous L brachiocephalic/L pulmonary vein anastomosis.
Respiratory distress was further compounded by R --> L shunt through the diseased lung.
ECHO @ [**Hospital1 **]- [**Location (un) 620**] showed mild RV hypokinesis.
Patient was covered broadly with vancomycin and cefepime for his pneumonia and started on steroids, albuterol and ipratropium for COPD exacerbation.
During his hospitalization, multiple attempts were made to decrease his respiratory support on the ventilator.
Patient was briefly able to tolerate a pressure support mode of ventilation but ultimately had to go back on AC when he became increasingly hypoxic.
Patient was intubated for a total of fourteen days and team had multiple discussions with family about his ongoing care and prognosis.
His respiratory distress was managed with fentanyl and midazolam.
