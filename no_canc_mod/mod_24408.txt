The patient had a L MCA dissection and large L MCA territory infarct [**11/2199**] with residual expressive aphasia and hemiplegia.
She underwent a bronchoscopy by IP at the time for residual dysphagia which showed subglottig stenosis above the stoma, and a T-tube was placed.
However, the T-tube was subsequently removed due to severe mucus plugging and a #6 cuffed portex tracheostomy tube was placed.
Patient was recently admitted from [**7-23**] to [**7-25**] for bleeding around tracheostomy tube.
During this coughing fit, her tracheostomy tube became dislodged and fell out.
After this episode she denied any cough, shortness of breath or chest pain.
However patient still presented to OSH ED for evaluation, where they attempted to replace trach into track with no success.
In ED, patient was evaluated and appeared in no acute distress.
On arrival to MICU, patient was comfortable and had no complaints.

There is no discrete mass or fluid collection or areas of abnormal enhancement around this area of stenosis.
There is the possibility of some granulation tissue, but given the lack of enhancement, this is difficult to assess.
There are slightly prominent lymph nodes bilaterally at the level 2A which do not demonstrate pathologic lymphadenopathy by imaging criteria.
The visualized portion of the brain shows an area of encephalomalacia and post-surgical changes previously noted on prior study in the left temporal region.
IMPRESSION: Grossly patent airway with an area of narrowing at the prior tracheostomy site at the level of C7-T1, without discrete mass, fluid collection or abnormal enhancement.
Brief Hospital Course: 39yoF s/p left cranioplasty and temporal lobectomy on [**11/2199**] for decompression after left MCA dissection and infarct, s/p tracheostomy for subglottic tracheal stenosis admitted after dislodged tracheostomy tube.
# Dislodged Tracheostomy Tube: OSH ED was unable to replace tracheostomy tube back in track.
However patient was oxygenating well and without any evidence of upper respiratory compromise.
CHRONIC ISSUES: No changes in medications or interventions necessary: #.
HTN #.
