Small volume of left pleural fluid and basal atelectasis are stable.
Orientation of multiple acute left lower lateral rib fractures is unchanged.
Asbestos-related diaphragmatic pleural calcification noted.
There is mild hydronephrosis of the right kidney.
A small amount of blood around the left kidney is redemonstrated.
There is no left hydronephrosis.
No shadowing stones are identified in either kidney.
A small/moderate amount of free fluid is redemonstrated about the spleen and liver; assessing changes in hemoperitoneum is difficult given difference in technique.
Doppler waveflow analysis of main renal arteries demonstrates brisk upstrokes bilaterally.
Mild right hydronephrosis, stable or slightly increased from [**2157-4-27**].
Small left perinephric blood collection with normal blood flow in the major renal vessels.
[**2157-4-27**] CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  Reason: please eval for psa/resolution CLINICAL INDICATION: Status post splenic laceration several days ago.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT images are acquired from the lung bases to the mid abdomen with and without intravenous contrast.
Bilateral pleural effusions are identified, left greater than right.
Areas of adjacent passive atelectasis are also seen.
Since the prior CT scan, there is increasing air within the pleural space noted at the lung base.
Recommend a chest x-ray for further characterization.
Evaluation of the spleen reveals interval decrease in the degree of perisplenic hematoma.
The differential considerations for this finding do include a small contained vascular injury such as a pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula.
Stable appearing left renal laceration is identified.
The adrenal glands and right kidney appear unremarkable.
_____ left-sided rib fractures identified.
Bibasilar areas of pleural calcification are identified.
Small, hyperattenuating focus seen within the splenic parenchyma with differential considerations including contained vascular injury such as a splenic arterial pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula.
Increasing air within the pleural space as noted.
Recommend a chest x-ray for further evaluation.
Bilateral pleural effusions and areas of adjacent passive atelectasis.
Unchanged appearance of a left renal laceration.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2157-4-21**] 10:44 PM HISTORY: Skiing accident with known severe intra-abdominal injuries.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular territorial infarct.
No underlying osseous abnormalities are identified.
There is mild circumferential mucosal thickening involving the right maxillary sinus and the ethmoid air cells with remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appearing unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  No acute traumatic injury.
An epidural catheter was placed for pain control due to his multiple rib fractures.
He was noted to have an elevated blood pressure; at home he had been on an ACEI, beta blocker and thiazide diuretic; these were restarted and his blood pressure stabilized.
He later developed hematuria noted with an increase in his creatinine.
Pulmonary: [**4-27**] CXR - L apical PTX on CXR, monitored clinically [**4-30**] CXR - Decrease in the size of the left-sided pneumothorax since the prior examination.
Stable amount of left pleural fluid and left lower lobe atelectasis.
The patient remained asymptomatic from the ptx and no intervention was performed  FEN/GI: Advanced to regular diet without complication.
Renal: The patient developed hematuria, difficulty voiding, and a rising creatinine.
Venodyne boots, no SQH given his splenic pseudoaneurysm.
Upon discharge, the patient was afebrile with all vitals stable, tolerating po feeds, ambulating well, with pain controlled on po pain medication, and urinating without difficulty   Medications on Admission: Atenolol 25', Enalapril 10', HCTZ 25', nexium  Discharge Medications: 1.
