Admission Date:  [**2103-10-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-10-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2025-10-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa(Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**] Chief Complaint: fatigue  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**Company **] adapta L ADDRL1 implantation on [**2103-10-19**]   History of Present Illness: 77 year-old woman with history of hypertension here with few days of profound fatigue and found to be in complete heart block with wide escape from the left posterior fascicle at a rate of 20-30bpm and BP of 80-90/40-50s.
EKG signficant for complete heart block with excape at a rate of 20-30bpm.
Labs signficant for Trop-T: 8.13, kidney failure with Cr at 4.7(baseline from [**2100**] at 1.1), phos-4.7, K-4.9, NA-132, and elevated WBC to 13.24 (80%N, no bands) and a relatively negative CXR.
A CXR was obtained demonstarting good positioning of corditis without complication.
On arrival to the floor, patient had no complaints.
Takes active care of her husband and hates being apart from him!
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Scattered crackles at bases.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Right neck with resolving rash at site of tegaderm.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES:  Palpable b/l LE DP/PT NEURO: No focal deficits, CN 2-12 grossly intacat.
IMAGING: [**2103-10-18**] Portable CXR: There is slight tortuosity and calcification along the thoracic aorta.
There is vague patchy hilar opacification on each side, which may suggest slight congestion.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF = 45%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and to pacemaker-induced dyssynchrony.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion subtending the epicardial surface where the pacemaker wire tip emerges.
There is no sign of cardiac tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2099-7-6**], the following findings are new: (1) pacemaker wire now seen in RA/RV, entering and probably perforating RV free wall (2) small pericardial effusion now seen subtending area where pacemaker wire tip seen (no sign of cardiac tamponade) (3) pacemaker-induced LV dyssynchrony is now present (4) inferior posterior wall hypokinesis now present (5) RV is now dilated and hypocontractile .
Bilateral pleural effusions are present.
Mild pulmonary edema from [**2103-10-21**] is mostly resolved.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 77 year old female with past medical history significant for hypertension presenting in complete heart block s/p temporary pacemaker placement and kidney failure (acute vs. CKD).
# Completed Inferior MI - Given q waves and lack of ST changes and elevated troponins, pt had MI in the near past, reports chest discomfort a week or so ago.
We started medical management with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325, Atorva 80, Metop XL 25, Echo showed inferior posterior wall hypokinesis, and EF 45%.
Pt was without chest pain during her admission.
# Acute Kidney Injury with possible CKD - Cr 4.7 on admission.
# HTN - We initially held all home BP meds (Dilt, HCTZ, telmasartan) during the admission given her low BPs.
### Transitions of care: - BP has been low during hospital stay, consider starting ACEi for remodeling benefit as outpatient.
Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg PO DAILY Hold SBP < 100, HR < 60 RX *metoprolol succinate 25 mg one tablet(s) by mouth daily Disp #*30 Tablet Refills:*2  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: national health solutions  Discharge Diagnosis: Complete Heart block Hypertension Ventricular perforation with pacer wire.
You had an abnormal heart rhythm called complete heart block and needed a temporary pacing wire that was changed to a permanant pacemaker to help your heart beat normally.
You had a heart attack before you came in to the hospital so we have started some medicines to help your heart recover from the heart attack.
