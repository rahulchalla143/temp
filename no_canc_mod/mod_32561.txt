He was admitted to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital on [**2141-8-1**] from [**Location (un) 270**] Jail after being arrested for public intoxication and developing hematemesis and falling in jail.
He had an episode of coffee ground emesis and an NGT was placed, with aspiration of 300 cc dark red blood and coffee grounds.
He also underwent an abdominal CT that demonstrated cirrhosis with severe esophageal varices extending to the portal vein and a head CT that was negative.
He underwent EGD on [**8-1**] with grade I esophogeal varices but no active bleeding, though there were stigmata of recent bleeding.
He then was noted to be acutely sedated in the setting of receving diazepam for ?withdrawal and underwent head CT that afternoon, which was again read as negative.
However, afterward, he had recurrent hematemesis.
He had a witnessed aspiration event and was started on imipenem emperically for aspiration pna and variceal bleeding.
Total transfusions were 10u PRBC and 8u FFP, with and 15 mg IV/SC vitamin K.  Because of continued bleeding and need for a possible [**Last Name (un) **] or TIPS procedure, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
On arrival, he was hemodynamically stable and scoped emergently by GI, with demonstration of no active bleeding.

Past Medical History: Alcoholism Cirrhosis (s/p EGD on [**3-30**] without varices) Acute febrile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome Seizure disorder Subgaleal bleed s/p head trauma MRSA positive   Social History: Currently homeless.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.4 BP: 140/75 P: 104 R: 18 O2: 99% (intubated) General: intubated, responds to noxious stimuli HEENT: ETT in place, sclera icteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: scattered rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, [**1-27**] SM Abdomen:  soft, non-distended GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema   Pertinent Results: ADMISSION LABS: .
Bilateral perihilar opacities, retrocardiac opacity.
EGD [**2141-8-2**]:  Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 3 cords of grade II varices were seen starting at 30 cm from the incisors in the gastroesophageal junction and lower third of the esophagus.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Diffuse continuous erythema, congestion, nodularity and petechiae of the mucosa were noted in the whole stomach.
These findings are compatible with extensive portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Other findings: no blood in stomach or duodenum Impression: Varices at the gastroesophageal junction and lower third of the esophagus.
No bleeding Erythema, congestion, nodularity and petechiae in the whole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy.
No blood in stomach or duodenum.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
EKG [**2141-8-1**]: NSR, nl axis, nl intervals, 2 mm q-wave in III, no acute ST-T wave changes.
Brief Hospital Course: 45-year-old man with history of HIV, hepatitis, and cirrhosis who is transferred from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital for management of upper GI bleed.
# GI bleed:  EGD showed bleeding varices and he underwent banding at [**Hospital 80985**] hospital.
Subsequently his HCT remained stable during this admission despite having guaiac positive stools.
On [**8-11**], he again was noted to have melanotic stools and NGT suction demonstrated gastric blood.
He was again placed on IV PPI and sucralfate, and he did not have any further episodes of bleeding.
# Respiratory failure:  Initially he was intubated for hypoxia and airway protection in the setting of UGIB and possible aspiration.
CXR was concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
His post extubation respiratory status remained stable although there was concern for a RUL lesion on CXR.
# Altered mental status:  On intial presentation he was noted to be sedated, which was attributed to diazepam that he received at OSH.
Also he was noted to have seizures (see below) and therefore his AMS was likely affected by post ictal confusion.
Once his sedation improved he was noted to be agitated/restless and this was treated with seroquel and prn haldol.
# Seizures: MRI with evidence of hypoxic encephalopathy and EEG with occipital focus for seizures.
# Cirrhosis:  Alcohol and hepatitis C are most likely etiology.
# Alcoholism:  No evidence of whithdrawl on discharge.
