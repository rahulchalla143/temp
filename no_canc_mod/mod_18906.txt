Well corticated fragments noted anterior to the C4 through C6 vertebral bodies are likely small regions of anterior longitudinal ligament ossificiation as no prevertebral soft tissues identified, however in the setting of trauma, ligamentous injury cannot be completely excluded.
The coronal view demonstrates mild asymmetry to the lateral masses of C1 on C2 on the left side due to slght head rotation.
Visualized contents of the intrathecal sac appear unremarkable, however MRI examination will be more sensitive for evaluation of spinal cord injury.
Maintained vertebral body height and alignment.
Small well corticated osseous fragments adjacent to the C4 through C6 vertebral bodies appear degenerative in nature as no prevertebral soft tissue swelling is identified, however in setting of hanging injury, ligamentous injury cannot be entirely excluded.
Mild asymmetry to the lateral masses of C1 on C2 due to rotation.
