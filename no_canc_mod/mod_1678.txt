Admission Date:  [**2144-4-19**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2082-1-26**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 62-year-old female with a complicated medical history including sarcoidosis, hepatic cirrhosis, Grade II esophageal varices, hypertension, multiple orthopaedic procedures to her left hip, right hip and right knee, who presented with left thigh recently admitted to Surgery for ventral hernia repair, which had caused an ileus and ascites, which required two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains.
The patient developed abdominal pain and diarrhea soon after.
The patient also developed left thigh pain.
The patient reported that the pain worsened to the point where she was unable to weight bear.
Her white blood cell count was noted to be 30, with 26% bandemia, and the patient was found to also be in acute renal failure with a creatinine up to 3.0.
On arrival to the [**Hospital 516**] Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was found to be lethargic, with pinpoint pupils secondary to dilaudid.
An amp of Narcan was given, with improvement of mental status.
On review of systems, the patient complains of exquisite pain in her left thigh, with decreased range of motion of her knee.
History of cirrhosis diagnosed by CT in [**2143-10-31**] with Grade II varices 4.
Hypertension 8.
Hypercholesterolemia 10.
Aortic stenosis with ejection fraction of 55% 11.
General examination revealed a lethargic patient, who became alert and oriented x 3 after Narcan administration.
Neck examination revealed no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination revealed that the patient was tachycardic, with normal S1 and S2, and III/VI systolic ejection murmur at right upper sternal border.
Lung examination revealed lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, with no wheezes or crackles.
The patient had a well-healed surgical scar with a scab in the subumbilical abdominal area.
The patient was mildly tender on palpation of the middle of her abdomen.
Extremity examination revealed trace bilateral lower extremity edema, tenderness and warmth along her left lateral thigh.
There was no induration or erythema.
Her electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia.
Her chest x-ray revealed no effusion, no pneumonia, and no pneumothorax.
There was minimal increased interstitial opacity, questionable atelectasis, in the lower lung bases.
Her ultrasound of her left thigh revealed a small fluid collection in the left lateral thigh.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   After being found hypotensive with hyperkalemia, the patient was treated with intravenous fluids and insulin and D-50, as well as hydrocortisone for stress dose steroids.
The patient's left thigh was evaluated by ultrasound, which showed a fluid collection suspicious for an abscess.
Surgery was consulted to evaluate the possibility of fasciitis in her left thigh.
The patient's hypotension resolved with aggressive intravenous fluid hydration and a brief course of pressors.
Her acute renal failure also appeared to improve after she was aggressively hydrated.
Her hyperkalemia began to resolved after insulin and D-50 treatments.
The patient's initial tachycardia on admission resolved after intravenous fluid hydration.
In terms of the patient's leukocytosis, the suspicion was that this is a reaction to the abscess in her left thigh.
On this MRI, the patient was found to have a discrete fluid collection in the subcutaneous tissue of the anterior abdominal wall measuring 16 x 20 x 3 cm.
The patient was also found to have extensive subcutaneous edema and small fluid collections in her left thigh.
She was found to not have any significant fluid within her left hip joint.
On this date, the patient had continual hypotension requiring aggressive fluid hydration, and also low-dose dopamine to be added via her central catheter.
Her blood culture on this date was found to have staphylococcus bacteremia.
On this date, the initial fluid aspirate from her left thigh also grew out coagulase positive staphylococcus aureus.
However, at the same time, the Surgical consultants felt strongly that this fluid should not be tapped due to potential for infecting it, and a potential connection with the patient's abdominal cavity, especially in the setting of known ascites.
On [**2144-4-22**], the patient was no longer requiring pressor support, and her creatinine had decreased to 2.0.
She also grew methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus at the aspirate of one fluid collection in her left thigh.
In the same culture, she also grew some bacillus species.
On [**2144-4-23**], the patient was found to have a positive urine culture growing Klebsiella pneumoniae.
As the patient has had stable blood pressure up until now, and has had peripheral edema due to saline resuscitation, the patient received a low-dose diuretic, and her urine output increased.
Her methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and left thigh abscess have been treated by continuing dosages of vancomycin, and the left thigh aspiration.
Her left thigh pain was much improved at this time, with no requirement of narcotics for pain control.
With regards to the patient's methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, the patient was determined to be too high risk to receive a transesophageal echocardiogram for further evaluation of her valves.
This is because she has known Grade II varices in her esophagus.
This is because she is thought to be high risk for seeding her known stenosed aortic valve.
She was diuresed with initially 20 mg of lasix by mouth, with minimal effects.
She had not been able to ambulate because of her gross lower extremity edema.
Her renal failure was completely resolved by this time.
This was thought to be from intravascular volume depletion due to aggressive diuresis.
This was thought to be a positive test result for her intravascular volume status.
However, on the same day, the patient noted new onset left thigh tenderness.
This was concerning for reaccumulation of fluids or reappearance of her left thigh abscess.
The patient was afebrile on this date.
Given the concerning symptoms, another ultrasound of her left lower extremity was obtained.
On this ultrasound, the patient was again found to have hypoechoic fluid collection tracking along her left lateral thigh.
After discussion with Surgery and Orthopaedics, it was determined that this fluid collection needed to be drained, with the placement of a pigtail catheter.
This was done on the morning of [**2144-4-28**], without complications.
The patient had purulent fluids drained from her left thigh fluid collection.
On the chest x-ray, the patient had no evidence of pneumonia.
Per patient's report, she stood up to go to the commode, and all of a sudden she felt gushing fluid coming from her abdomen.
The patient did require frequent dressing change, and had persistent leakage of clear-looking fluid from this site.
Due to the physical characteristics of the fluid drained from the patient's left thigh fluid collection, she was started on levofloxacin by mouth for broadening antibiotic coverage until this fluid culture returns.
The concern here is multiorganism infection which was not covered by vancomycin.
