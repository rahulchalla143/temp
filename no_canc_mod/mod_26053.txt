Admission Date:  [**2179-4-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-4-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-5-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 69 M with PMH significant for COPD who initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2179-4-16**] with chest pain and shortness of breath.
He is originally from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 14966**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NY and came to the [**Location (un) 3320**] area for a fishing trip with his wife two days ago.
According to his wife, his respiratory problems go back over the last 1-2 years.
He was diagnosed with COPD and told to use intermittent advair and oxygen at night.
He was stable until the previous few days when he was having sore throat, cough productive of white sputum, and increased dyspnea.
He admitted occasional subjective fevers, but no chills, had more trouble breathing at night, and felt better sitting on edge of the bed, but did not wish to use more than 1 pillow at night.
He has also noted some increasing ankle edema over the last few days.
Normally, he is physically active and able to maintain his farm with horses, dogs, cats, chickens, and rabbits without difficulty.
While on the fishing boat, he had worsening dyspnea and chest pressure, and was sent by EMS to [**Hospital3 **].
EKG appeared to have no ischemic changes.
CXR was felt to be consistent with failure, though official read was "clear", and he was given 20 IV lasix, resulting in 1500mL out.
EKG was done which showed no acute changes.
He was admitted to the MICU for concern of respiratory failure and potential requirement of mechanical ventilation.
He was treated with SoluMedrol 125mg IV q8h, Advair, Spiriva, and albuterol nebs for presumed COPD exacerbation.
He had a non-contrast chest CT, which demonstrated diffuse patchy bilateral ground opacities and interlobular septal thickening, and moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions with atelectasis.
Past Medical History: hypertension COPD - on home o2 at night for "oxygen deficiency" since 1 year ago left hip replacement [**2168**] - horse accident   Social History: Smoked 1 PPD x 40 years, quit 10 years ago.
Family History: no FH of CAD or DM  Physical Exam: Vitals: 98.4F BP: 138/59 P: 96 RR: 22 SaO2: 96% 2L NC Gen: Pleasant Caucasian male, lying comfortably in bed, ruddy complexion, NAD, speaking in full sentences.
HEENT: PERRL, MMM Resp: crackles bilateral bases, diminished breath sounds bilterally CV: RRR nl s1s2 +2/m SEM at apex Abd: soft, obese, NT/ND +BS no organomegaly Ext: 2+ pitting edema bilaterally Neuro: A&Ox3, no focal deficits.
left CP angle clear, right not visualized.
(Though officially read as no pna or CHF) .
Chest CT (same day as CXR): FINDINGS: There are diffuse patchy ground-glass opacifications within both lung fields.
There is no focal consolidation.
There are moderate-sized bilateral layering pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
No significant bullae are seen.
Numerous small lymph nodes are seen scattered throughout the mediastinum, the largest being a 9-mm subcarinal lymph node.
Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
Patchy ground-glass opacifications, interlobular septal thickening and bilateral pleural effusions, all indicative of pulmonary edema.
No focal bullae or consolidation.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Minimally increased gradient c/w minimal AS.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Based on [**2169**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (?#) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Minimal aortic stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Based on [**2169**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.

His lungs were clear by the time of discharge, with no clinical evidence of ongoing COPD flare.
#) CHF: Chest CT consistent with pulmonary edema.
TTE was done, which demonstrated predominantly diastolic dysfunction, most likely [**12-31**] tachycardia in setting of increased sympathetic drive from COPD exacerbation, and beta-blockade will be important facet of outpatient regimen.
His bicarb remained high, most likely [**12-31**] compensation for his respiratory acidosis, as well as [**12-31**] contraction alkalosis.
He was given one dose of acetazolamide 250mg IV on the morning of d/c in hopes of mediating elevated bicarb.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] should also have an outpatient stress test, as described below.
He was also instructed to make an appointment to see his PCP this week for follow-up of his respiratory and volume status, with further adjustments to be carried out on an outpatient basis.
#) Chest pressure - Admits stable anginal symptoms, with exertional chest pressure.
Should have an outpatient stress test to r/o reversible defects once respiratory status optimized.
LDL found to be 84 at OSH, so statin not started, although could consider adding statin as outpatient for overall efects on plaque stabilization if CAD is ongoing concern.
#) Prophylaxis - Maintained on subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen.
