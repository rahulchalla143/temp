Small acute right subdural hematoma, with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and right inferior frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Together, these exert moderate local mass effect, with 4-mm leftward subfalcine herniation, and likely early right uncal herniation.
Left skull base fracture, extending from diastasis of the left occipital mastoid suture, through the left temporal bone, left petrous apex, and terminating in the sphenoid sinus, which is opacified with blood.
Small focus of air is seen in the left carotid canal, with fracture extending through this region, and CTA is recommended to exclude injury to the carotid artery.
CTA neck ([**2190-5-6**]) IMPRESSION: No evidence of carotid artery injury.
For further description of the skull base fracture please see concurrent CT of the temporal bones.
head CT repeat ORBITS/SELLA ([**2190-5-6**]): IMPRESSION: Redemonstration of the left skull base fracture extending from a diastasis of the left occipital mastoid suture and through the left temporal bone, petrous apex and terminating in the sphenoid sinus.
Again, there is concern for injury to the carotid canal which has a small focus of air.
Please see concurrent CTA of the neck to evaluate for carotid injury.
CT head ([**2190-5-7**]): IMPRESSION: Since the previous study right frontal hemorrhagic contusion and right-sided acute subdural hematoma are unchanged in size and extent.
There is decrease in cerebral edema and decrease in mass effect with better visualization of the basal cisterns compared to the prior study.
CT head ([**2190-5-8**]): IMPRESSION: No significant interval change since [**2190-5-7**].
No new hemorrhage.
CT head ([**2190-5-11**]): IMPRESSION: No significant interval change since [**2190-5-8**].
Stable right frontal intraparenchymal and subdural hemorrhages with no new hemorrhage or mass effect.
His only complaint was headache, likely related to his traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.
He sustained very little deficits after his fall.
It was explained to mom that this change in his behavior might be secondary to his intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Additionally, due to difficulty with headache management, the pain team was consulted.
Disp:*150 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) basilar skull fracture 2) right-sided subdural hematoma 3) right inferior frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
4) traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Discharge Condition: good; no difficulties with vision, speech, ambulation, strength.
Mainly complaining of headache that was treated well with a dose of fioricet.
Discharge Instructions: You sustained a basilar skull fracture, a small right sided subdural hematoma, a right inferior frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.
You may continue to have headaches, and this is why we consulted the pain service during this admission.
This medication must also be used sparingly because you may also suffer from rebound headaches due to overuse of this drug.
*** Please contact the neurosurgery office or return to the nearest emergency room if you experience any difficulty with your vision; any weakness on a particular side of your body; any involuntary movements of a particular side of your body; difficulty with walking; or difficulty with talking.
