Admission Date:  [**2173-7-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-8-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-4-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Egg  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1390**] Chief Complaint: Rectal bleeding  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2173-7-22**] Diagnostic laparoscopy and rigid sigmoidoscopy.
[**2173-7-24**] Colonoscopy   History of Present Illness: This is a 67 year old male with a medical history of DM, HTN who presented to an OSH ED with rectal bleeding.
He initially had 3-4 days of constipation which was then followed by profuse watery diarrhea for 5-6 days which was then followed by three days of constipation.
During that time he had no other symptoms, no fevers or chills no nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain.
He did not have any bloody stools at the time.
At the OSH ED he developed frank rectal bleeding, hypotension (80/34), tachycardia.
A CT with contrast was done that showed colonic and small bowel distention, no free air or fluid, and a likely rectal impaction.
A repeat CT (CTA) done at [**Hospital1 **] showed interval development of sigmoid and left sided colitis as well as the new development of ascities.
He was given 4mg of IV morphine with minimal change of pain.
I performed a rectal exam which had significant amount of formed stool and bright red blood around it.
Pt had a large BM after the exam with semi-formed stool with bright red blood coating it.
The repeated labs were then notable for fibrinogen which increased from 72->99, with D-Dimer at [**Numeric Identifier 24587**].
The surgical team who had already evaluated the pt in the ED was called back, given that his abd pain was worsening and he still had blood BMs.
His lactate was also trending back up 8.7 in the OHS-> 1.4 in the ED to 4.4 in the MICU which was concerning for worsening ischemia.
He denies any colon or GI cancer  Physical Exam: Temp 99.9   HR 102   BP117/84   RR 16   O2 sat 100% 2L NC General: Alert, oriented, in significant pain, laying in fetal position HEENT: Sclera anicteric, mucous membranes dry, oropharynx clear  Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: tachy, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: tender diffusely but worse in the lower abdomen, + bowel sounds, +gaurding, + rebound Rectal: frank blood mixed with stool, hard stool palpated, no rectal mass Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Skin: dry skin noted on the skins bilaterally  Pertinent Results: IMAGING: OSH CT: No AAA but prominent vascular calcifications involving the aorta, diffuse colonic distention, scattered loops of mildly dilated small bowel, No free intraab gas or fluid, likely rectal impaction.
Interval development of bowel wall thickening and hypoenhancement of the left hemicolon raising strong concern for ischemic colitis.
New small volume ascites.
Moderate rectal fecal impaction.
Possible active GI bleeding along the ascending colon.

At the OSH ED he developed frank rectal bleeding, hypotension (80/34), tachycardia and a CT with contrast showed colonic and small bowel distention, and stool impaction.
He was transfused again and CTA showed interval development of sigmoid and left sided colitis as well as the new development of ascites.
He had an elevated lactate, leukocytosis and tachycardia though was normotensive with IVF and blood products.
GI was consulted who felt his clinical picture and rapid decompensation were most concerning for ischemic colitis.
Patient's abdominal exam continued to worsen, his lactate increased despite IVF and ABX so surgery was consulted and he had an exploratory laparotomy on [**7-22**] that showed diffuse bowel edema/mucosal inflammation but no necrosis, no resection was performed.
He has improved clinically, has been afebrile and normotensive since [**7-22**] but has had alcohol withdrawal and delirium which has complicated his course but is improved with Diazepam.
His GI symptoms have been ascribed to mesenteric ischemia in a patient with known atherosclerotic disease.
Initiating a diet was on hold as he developed DT's and his nutrition was given via feeding tube.
Once his withdrawal symptoms resolved it took a few days for him to clear the benzodiazepines and eventually he had a speech and swallow evaluation and was cleared for a regular diabetic diet.
