Patient was a poor historian and unable to tell much of her medical history.
Briefly, patient was admitted for pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia.
Past Medical History: # HTN # Emphysema # Bleeding Ulcers # Hepatitis B (tx related) # Bleeding ulcers # Carotid stent when 22 y/o # L Lymph node removal # Hyperparathyroidism s/p removal # Chronic back pain # Hx neurosyphilis # C. Difficile colitis  Social History: She lives alone and gets help from son and [**Name2 (NI) 9259**]; she has smoked 2PPD for approximately 40 years and note of quiting as of this past 9/08 per pt.
Per patient and son, she is competent in most ADLs and IADLs, but due to worsening vision (from cataracts) she has becoming increasingly dependent on support from family.
MMM CARDIAC: RRR, no m/r/g LUNGS: Coarse breath sounds throughout, no resp distress ABDOMEN: NABS.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: trace edema in lower extremities SKIN: No rashes/lesions, ecchymoses.
No acute intracranial process.
Marked chronic microvascular ischemic changes  Left LENI [**2166-2-28**]: No left lower extremity DVT.
New bilateral septal thickening and bilateral pleural effusions worse on the right likely reflecting volume overload.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta and coronary vasculature.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo F with severe COPD, HTN, and recent admission for lingular PNA with workup concerning for multiple pulmonary nodules and possible malignancy presents as a transfer from the medical [**Hospital1 **] immediately after ED admission with hypotension and hypoxia.
# Hypoxia: Resolved on transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**12-23**] Recurrent Lingular Pneumonia - Recent CT chest from [**12-30**] showing multiple b/l pulm nodules concerning for mets without found primary lesion raising suspicion for post-obstructive PNA vs. infiltrate from malginancy.
She did have fever and elevated WBC on presentation to the ED supporting active infection.
As she quickly clinically improved her vancomycin was stopped and chest CT showed almost complete resolution of multiple pulmonary nodules seen in [**12-30**], which indicated a likely infectious etiology.
There was evidence of volume overload, and she was diuresed with further improvement of her respiratory status.
CHADS score 2; however, given h/o bleeding ulcers and possible poor compliance with meds/followup, would not advise anticoagulating for now.
# COPD, severe - 40 pack year smoking history, quit [**7-29**], with severe centrilobular emphysematous changes on most recent CT. Was not started on steroids given concern for acute PNA, and repeat chest CT showed resolution of previously seen nodules as well as mild volume overload, treated as above.
# Hypotension: Floor team unable to obtain SBP >60/palp in the absence of obtundation despite 4L NS.
Home BP meds were initially held but restarted for afib with RVR as above, and her pressures remained stable afterwards.
# Hyponatremia - Likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia and HCTZ use, this resolved after IVF resuscitation and holding HCTZ.
# Acute Renal Failure - Likely prerenal in setting of acute infection.
Patient appeared volume depleted on exam on admission.
# Chronic Anemia, normocytic - Dates back to [**9-28**] with baseline around 30.
Iron studies from [**12-30**] consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
# Carotid Stent: continued with Plavix  # Dispo: PT initially recommended rehab, but the patient adamantly refused.
