In late [**2097**] the patient began to experience increasing episodes of AF and underwent pulmonary vein isolation/flutter ablation on [**2099-4-1**].
In [**Month (only) 1096**] of [**2098**] he had a prolonged episode of rapid palpitations that required cardioversion.
Following this he has had almost monthly episodes of rapid palpitations that he has treated with am "Flecainide cocktail", described as 300mg every four hours until resolution of symptoms.
He has not had further palpitations since then and is referred for left atrial tachycardia ablation.
He had intermittent LE edema which he treated with compression stockings and as needed lasix.
When he is in the arrhythmia for a prolonged period, he is aware of palpitations and a feeling of being run down.
He presented on the morning of admission to the CCU for elective ablation for A-fib complicated by pericardial effusion.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes (pre), + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: PAF s/p multiple cardioversions, s/p ablation [**3-/2099**], s/p ablation [**7-/2100**] Sleep apnea (does not use machine) Elevated PSA, three prior biopsies negative [**2083**] Cholecystectomy ?
Family History: His grandfather also had atrial fibrillation.
He has two daughters, one of whom is 29, has had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for the past five years.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
[**2100-7-21**] TTE: There is a small-moderate pericardial effusion visualized along the LV apex and right ventricle.
Following aspiration of 400 cc of fluid, the amount of pericardial effusion appears small without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2100-7-22**]: TTE There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Trivial pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 yo male with PAF, HTN, and HLD who presented for elective ablation for A-fib complicated by pericardial effusion.
#Pericardial Effusion: Patient's ablation procedure was complicated with ablation through left atriam with resulting pericardial effusion.
He was placed on neo and pericardiocentsis was perfromed with drainage of 500cc of bloody fluid.
He reported improvement in his pleuritic chest pain.
Overnight patient had about 125ml of serosangrounes fluid in the drain with no blood or clot therefore the drain was removed and sterile dressing applied.
He had repeat echo in the morning which did not show any further reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.
Patient was discahrged on colchicine 0.6mg for one month to help with pain and prevent pericarditis.
#Recurrent atrial fibrillation: He underwent a left atrial ablation for recurrent PAF.
Colchicine 0.6 mg PO DAILY Duration: 30 Days   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: pericardial effusion  Secondary: atrial fibrilation   Discharge Condition: Hospital course;  Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 90268**] was  admitted to the hospital following an elective ablation for recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation.
It was complicated by a collection of fluid around your heart.
You were admittted to the hospital following an ablation to treat atrial fibrillation.
The procedure was complicated by a collection of fluid around your heart.
- Please take colchicine daily for 1 month to prevent inflammation around the heart.
This medicine may cause nausea and diarrhea.
