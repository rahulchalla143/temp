HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old man with history of dilated cardiomyopathy since [**2094**] which was diagnosed in [**Hospital6 1129**], at which time his catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 38% with no coronary artery disease.
Over the last several years he has been followed with echocardiogram which has revealed worsening of his congestive heart failure.
He also has 3+ aortic regurgitation, 3+ mitral regurgitation and had pacemaker placement in [**2101-12-7**] for marked AV conduction delay.
He has had several admissions for congestive heart failure between [**12/2101**] and [**6-6**] and did reasonably well for approximately 6-8 weeks in regimen of Hydralazine and diuretics.
Major reason for the Emergency Room visits was shortness of breath.
He had a sleep study which revealed obstructive sleep apnea and therefore was started on C-PAP approximately two weeks prior to admission but did not tolerate it well.
On [**9-16**] he was transferred from CCH to [**Hospital3 4527**] and had pacemaker interrogation which showed conversion from normal sinus rhythm to atrial fibrillation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for atrial fibrillation with recent onset, cardiomyopathy diagnosed in [**2094**] with an EF of 38%.
Echocardiogram in [**2097**], [**Month (only) 404**], revealed an EF of 45% with mild aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation with diffuse hypokinesis.
In [**2100-10-6**] he had an EF of 45% with severe mitral regurgitation.
In [**2102-5-7**] ejection fraction of less than 20% with severe aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation as well as left ventricular dilatation.
He had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in [**2093**], history of anemia, combined iron deficiency and chronic disease and he is status post cholecystectomy.
Also has a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, obstructive central mixed sleep apnea, gout.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for shortness of breath, anorexia over the past two days prior to admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission he was afebrile with blood pressure of 102/48, pulse 64, respirations 18 to 20.
He appeared comfortable, with no distress.
HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, bilateral ptosis which is noted to be longstanding.
Neck, positive JVD but no carotid bruits.
Cardiac, S1 and S2, normal with a [**3-14**] holosystolic murmur at the apex and a 1-2/6 diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.
Extremities, positive for edema, positive pedal pulses.
Echocardiogram done on [**9-19**] revealed an EF of 15% with marked left atrial enlargement and right atrial enlargement with patent foramen ovale, left ventricular dilatation and 2+ aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, no major changes since the echocardiogram done in [**2102-5-7**].
The decision was made to delay biventricular pacing at that time given his atrial fibrillation and suboptimal hemodynamics.
His cardiac function remained stable, however, he became dry last few days of admission with decreased po intake and continued po diuresis with Lasix and his Lasix dose was held on [**2102-9-19**] and po intake was encouraged to keep him euvolemic.
He was switched to Amiodarone po 400 mg q d and was given Heparin until the date of discharge at which point his Coumadin became therapeutic and that was stopped.
Pulmonary wise he had severe pulmonary edema on admission and had an oxygen requirement, however, this improved markedly with his diuresis and over the last few days of his hospital course he had no oxygen requirement whatsoever, was satting well on room air.
Renal, his BUN and creatinine decreased to 1.9 creatinine and this later increased after being transferred from the unit up to 2.7, most likely secondary to dehydration and intravascular depletion.
GI, he had occasional bouts of loose bowel movements.
He continued to have poor po intake and for this reason a swallowing study was done which revealed no abnormalities in swallowing except for some poor chewing and suggestion was made for soft diet with lots of fluid supplement.
The Probenecid was stopped because of his renal function.
The patient was started on Effexor because of depression and was seen by physical therapy and case management because of decreased strength compared to his baseline.
