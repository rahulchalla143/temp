Patient underwent diagnostic arteriogram on that admission which [**Year (4 digits) 3780**] right lower extremity occlusive disease with high-grade stenosis at the proximal profunda and minimal distal reconstruction.
He returns now secondary to poor pain control at home for possible intervention.
He denies any constitutional symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath or dyspnea.
He denies any acute changes in his rest pain symptoms, although he has noted increased erythema of the lower extremity.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2128-3-16**], ejection fraction is 35%, history of hypercholesterolemia, history of chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 1.2, history of peripheral vascular disease status post right external iliac stenting status post left AKA, status post iliofemoral endarterectomy on the left, status post right common femoral- peroneal bypass with in situ saphenous vein in [**2120**], status post right fem-peroneal with in situ saphenous vein to the right fem-peroneal with thrombectomy and vein patch angioplasty, right inguinal herniorrhaphy, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stenting in [**2128-3-16**].
General appearance is alert, oriented male in no acute distress.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
Heart is a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop or rub.
Lower extremity exam shows mild blanching and erythema with tenderness to palpation.

Patient was started on Dilaudid for analgesia control.
Acute pain service was consulted, and recommendations to begin Dilaudid PCA.
They continued to follow the patient during his hospitalization until his initial surgery with adjustment in his PCA dosing for adequate pain control.
The patient was continued on IV heparin with some improvement in his ischemic pain.
Foley was placed for urinary retention.
for pain with Tylenol 650 mg q.
Dilaudid was recommended only if tramadol did not provide adequate pain control.
PVRs were obtained which showed extremely poor perfusion at all levels.
His INR was 2.3 and required fresh frozen plasma for reversal.
He developed postoperative hypotension with a rise in his troponin.
The patient was transferred to the SICU for continued monitoring and vasopressive support.
Patient was in congestive failure.
IV heparinization was instituted secondary to evidence of MI by troponin levels.
Patient remained intubated and underwent a diagnostic cardiac cath on [**2129-4-25**] via the right brachial artery which [**Year (4 digits) 3780**] main trunk stent was patent, the left anterior descending with diffuse disease with a stenosis of 50%, the left circumflex was totally occluded to the first obtuse marginal, the right coronary artery was the dominant system with an 80% stenosis in the PDA.
Patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation on [**4-27**] which required amiodarone drip and continued amiodarone conversion to oral medication.
On [**4-28**], the patient continued in significant congestive heart failure requiring continued IV Lasix.
Patient was made floor status with telemetry.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Right foot ischemic, rest pain, peripheral vascular disease status post right external iliac stenting, status post left above-knee amputation, status post left iliofemoral endarterectomy, status post right common femoral-peroneal bypass with in situ saphenous vein, status post right femoral-peroneal thrombectomy with vein angioplasty, history of hypertension, history of coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties with stenting [**2128-3-16**], history of hypercholesterolemia, history of right inguinal hernia status post repair, postoperative urinary retention, postoperative blood loss anemia-- transfused, postoperative non-ST elevation myocardial infarction on [**2129-4-23**], postoperative congestive heart failure secondary to myocardial infarction, postoperative hypertension--uncontrolled, requiring medication adjustment, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci by rectal swab.
