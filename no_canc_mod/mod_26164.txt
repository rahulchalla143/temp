History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 40612**] is a 66-year old male with a history of hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presents from an OSH with unstable angina.
Says that two days prior to admission to outside hospital, he awoke from sleep with chills and shivering.
The following morning, he went out for an hour long walk without any dyspnea on exertion.
On night prior to admission to OSH, he again woke from sleep with chills and subjective coldness.
EKG showed AF but no ischemic changes.
He denied chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness or dizziness.
Also notable was a bandemia to 17% on a WBC of 3.9.
He received lopressor 5 mg for atrial fibrillation with rates to 160s.
He denied fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, chest pain, palps or lightheadedness.
Said that he has no h/o anginal type symptoms, that he walks about 3 miles per day without difficulty prior to this episode.
Possible sleep apnea (does not use CPAP therapy).
Bilateral hip replacement.
.. CARDIAC HISTORY: CABG:  None Percutaneous coronary intervention: None Pacemaker/ICD placed: None .. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Smoking quit 30 yrs ago, <10 pk-yrs total - Hypercholesterolemia + Hypertension - Diabetes - Family history of premature cardiac death or MI  Social History: He is married and lives in [**Location (un) 3844**].
Similarly he has a remote history of significant alcohol use but has not had a drink in many years.
Family History: His father had diabetes and died of stroke at 65.
No family history of sudden cardiac death, cardiomyopathy, or premature coronary artery disease.
Physical Exam: VITALS:  T 97.1, BP 123/74, HR 135 irregular, RR 16, 96% RA GENERAL:  AAOx3, NAD, talking complete sentences, sitting upright in bed breathing normally HEENT:  EOMI, PERRLA NECK:  Supple, non-tender HEART:  Distant and irregular heart sounds.
No obvious murmurs.
No focal changes in breath sounds.
No wheezes or crackles at bases.
[**Last Name (un) **]:  Soft, non-tender, no masses.
LEGS:  No pitting edema.
CXR:  FINDINGS: The lungs are clear without consolidation or effusion.
IMPRESSION: There is no radiological evidence of pneumonia.
No ST-T changes or TWI.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**8-1**]): No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.. 2D- ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2164-8-29**]):  PER OUTSIDE HOSPITAL RECORD LV dilitation with diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with EF 20%, biatrial enlargement, mild to moderate MR. .. TRANS-THORACIC ECHO ([**2164-8-31**]): The atria are moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (consistent with tachycardia, toxic, metabolic process, etc.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global systolic dysfunction.
Dilated right ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-8-11**], tachycardia and mild LV dysfunction are new.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is a 66-year old man with a history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presents from OSH with elevated troponins in setting of AF with RVR, fevers, and question of gram positive cocci bacteremia.
He had no history of diabetes, no CAD history, and no history of anginal-type symptoms during his 3-mile/day walks.
There was no significant family history of premature CAD and no Q-waves on EKG to indicate a prior myocardial infarction.
His elevated troponins at OSH were believed due to demand ischemia in the setting of prolonged tachycardia and febrile illness.
He was without chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, or dizziness throughout the hospitalization.
He complained only of mild fatigue that was subacute over the days leading up to admission.
We were unsure of the accuracy of the recent measurement, given the absence of significant CHF symptoms or cause for such a dramatic decrease in ejection fraction.
Iron studies were checked to r/o hemochromatosis and TSH came back normal to r/u hypo or hyperthyroidism; EKG, as above, did not show any pathologic q-waves or ST-deviations and thus was not suggestive of active or past coronary artery disease.
# RHYTHM:  He presented in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response of 130s.
However, after 20 mg of Lopressor his rate came down to the 110s, but he remained in atrial fibrillation.
He was monitored on telemetry for 24 hours and discharged on carvedilol for rate control and his outpatient coumadin dose for embolic stroke prevention.
# HTN:  At admission he was hypotensive with SBP in the 90-100s.
# FEVERS / ?PNA / ?GPC BACTEREMIA:  Per OSH records, he had Tm 102.4 upon arrival at ED on [**8-29**].
His initial CXR showed possible pneumonia and labs showed 17% bands on normal white count.
When he remained afebrile and the speciation from OSH showed coag-negative staph, vancomycin was discontinued.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Community acquired pneumonia Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response status post cardioversion .
Secondary: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] after experiencing fever and an abnormal rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
You may have had a Pneumonia which caused your fever.
If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, recurrent fevers or any other concerning symptoms, please call your primary care doctor or go to the nearest Emergency Department.
