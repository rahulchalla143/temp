The patient reports an initial increase of her baseline abdominal pain on [**6-18**], which progressed until she presented to an OSH on [**6-20**].
The pain is described as a severe ache, primarily in the L epigastrium with radiation to the back as well as some R iliac pain.
Depression 2.
Necrotizing Gallstone pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst  PSH: C-section x2 Cystgastrostomy Appendectomy  Social History:  Former cigarette smoker, 2ppd x30 yrs, quit 4 years ago; Rare EtOH use; No IVDU.
Family History: non contributory  Physical Exam: PE: T 99.0 HR 94 BP 122/80 RR 24 SpO2 93RA GEN: NAD, A&O x3, pleasant, comfortable, WD/WN, NCAT, PERRLA, EOMI RRR, no m/r/g CTA B obese abdomen, 2 midline scars (one above, one below the umbilicus), small [**Last Name (un) **] scar, tenderness in LUQ, mild tenderness in RLQ.
Acute on chronic pancreatitis with development of complex pseudocyst with 4.6 cm dominant component insinuating under the hepatic capsule, exerting mass effect upon the caudate lobe.
New tortuosity and dilatation of the pancreatic duct within the tail to the level of the gastric anastomosis suggests stenosis at the pancreatico-gastric anastamosis.
No residual enhancement of pancreatic body parenchyma body related to prior necrosis.
New thrombosis of left portal vein branches to segments II and III and non- occlusive thrombus within the main left portal vein.
Increase in size of now 2.4 cm cystic lesion in pancreatic tail.
Stable size of subcentimeter cystic lesion of uncinate process.
The pancreatic duct is clearly seen with no evidence of any strictures.
Contrast is seen within the pancreatic head outside the duct which is consistent with an acinar extenstion of contrast.
The common bile duct, cystic duct, and intrahepatic ducts are of normal caliber with no evidence of any filling defects or other abnormality  [**2145-7-5**] Abd CT:IMPRESSION:  1.
Multifocal hemorrhage into known pancreatic pseudocyst in the  gastrohepatic ligament and hepatic subcapsular spaces with marked enlargement since [**2145-6-27**]; it exerts mass effect on the liver, stomach and vasculature in the upper abdomen.
New main portal vein thrombus with occlusion and collateral formation to supply the left and right portal veins.
Persistent partial thrombus in the main left portal vein and within segment 2  3.
Small fluid collection anterior to tail of pancreas and peri-splenic fluid likely related to pancreatitis.
Mild pancreatic tail duct dilation is unchanged from [**2145-6-27**].
Extensive peripancreatic fluid collections and pseudocyst formation with hemorrhagic components.
Superior extension of the organizing complex fluid collections into the mediastinum, incompletely imaged.
New poorly defined fluid collection along the left anterolateral abdominal wall.
New organizing pseudocyst anterior to the stomach in the left upper quadrant.
Her abdominal pain gradually subsided and she started a clear liquid diet.
Attempts were made over 48 hours to increase her to a regular low fat diet however her symptoms recurred prompting insertion of a PICC line and beginning TPN.
MRCP was done on [**2145-6-27**] which showed a portal vein thrombosis as well as some compression of the caudate lobe of the pancreas.
Her abdominal pain also increased.
She started anticoagulation with heparin for the thrombosis and plans were made for a distal pancreatectomy during this admission.
On [**2145-7-5**] she developed increased abdominal pain and shortness of breath.
Her O2 sats improved although her chest Xray showed a left effusion with atelectasis.
Unfortunately she desaturated again and was short of breath prompting transfer back to the ICU.
Her chest xray showed an increase in the left effusion with some compressive atelectesis.
Subsequently a left pigtail catheter was placed for drainage of the effusion and she had immediate relief of her symptoms.
She was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service and was found to be very deconditioned secondary to her prolonged hospitalization.
Nutritionally, she continued her TPN which was eventually cycled simply for her convenience during the daytime and she remained on a full liquid diet without any significant abdominal pain.
Her diet was increased to low fat on the day of discharge but she will continue her TPN and should she have any problems with this diet she should be scaled back to clear liquids.
She was taking Ultram on a routine basis for pain which was tolerated well.
