Admission Date:  [**2142-11-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-12-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-7-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: shortness of [**First Name3 (LF) 1440**]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right-sided thoracentesis CT-guided biopsy of a lung nodule cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 61 year old Hatian-Creole speaking female who presented on [**2142-11-27**] with shortness of [**Date Range 1440**].
The patient reports intermittent SOB over the past year.
She was admitted for an extended period of time to [**Hospital 8**] hospital in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year and had an extensive workup which included the diagnosis of severe dilated cardiomyopathy.
Immediately following her return she started experiencing worsening of her shortness of [**Country 1440**].
She also was experiencing pain in legs bilaterally as well as lower extremity swelling.
On presentation she endorsed paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea also endorsed a cough productive of white sputum.
At baseline she is able to walk [**1-23**] blocks without shortness of [**Month/Day (2) 1440**] but on presentation had dyspnea with one or two steps.
She also reported an itchy rash on her chest, back and feet which has only been present "while she has been sick."
In the ER she was found to be hypertensive with SBP in the 170s for which she was started on a nitroglycerin drip.
CXR showed a R. sided pleural effusion and a CT torso revealed multiple filling defects which were felt to represent chronic pulmonary emboli and not an acute process.
Review of systems: Denies fevers/chills, headache, chest pain or pressure, and abdominal pain.
Has noted a decrease in her appetite for a while, with some weight loss (unable to quantify), but recently this is improved.

Pleural fluid cytology-  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Reactive mesothelial cells, histiocytes and lymphocytes .
Flow Cytometry, peripheral blood- INTERPRETATION:  Non-specific T-cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
CXR, portable, [**2142-11-27**]- Right pleural effusion with associated consolidation, likely atelectasis.
Multiple eccentrically located filling defects and linear webs in the branches of the pulmonary arteries as described above, concerning for chronic pulmonary emboli.
No defintite acute PE is identified.
Multiple nodular opacities measuring up to 9 mm in diameter.
Gallbladder wall thickening and edema with calcified gallstones suggestive of acute cholecystitis.
Extensive occlusive DVT of the right distal femoral, popliteal and posterior tibial veins with more acute clot distally and a more chronic appearance proximally.
Chronic DVT with recanalization of the right superficial femoral vein.
No definitive evidence of left-sided acute or chronic thrombus, however, some wall irregularity is noted.
ECHO (TTE), [**2142-11-28**]- Conclusions:  The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20%).
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate to severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is likely UNDERestimated due to elevated right atrial pressures.
CXR, portable, [**2142-11-29**]- Reason: evaluate for PTX s/p R thoracentesis In comparison with the study of [**11-27**], there has been removal of a substantial amount of fluid from the right pleural space.
No convincing evidence of pneumothorax.
CXR, PA & LAT, [**2142-12-1**] 12:03pm- Reason: Questionable reaccumulation of right pleural effusion.
There is interval increase in right pleural effusion [since [**11-29**]], which appears to be partially loculated with predominantly increased anterolateral rather than posterior component of pleural fluid.
The lungs are clear except for unchanged opacity in the right mid lung consistent with area of atelectasis demonstrated on a torso CT from [**2142-11-27**].
There have been no acute interval changes.
Marked cardiomegaly, right pleural effusion are unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax and overt CHF.
EKG, [**2142-12-1**]- Sinus rhythm with premature ventricular beat.
Left atrial abnormality.
Q-T interval is slightly shorter.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST, [**2142-12-4**]- Reason: Please assess pulmonary "nodules" noted in [**2142-11-27**] CTA for round atelectasis [**2-23**] CHF vs. masses, suspicious for malignancy.
Impression: One-week stability of multiple roughly nodular subpleural lesions in the lower lungs argues against bacterial infection, such as septic emboli, and could be due instead to more indolent pathogens such as Nocardia or even fungus.
Involution of the thymus also argues for an infection, but more likely is vasculitis, including Wegener or Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], and lymphoma, including lymphomatoid granulomatosis.
Left atrial abnormality.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Diffuse ST-T wave changes - could be due in part to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Since previous tracing of [**2142-12-1**], further ST-T wave changes seen.
CT-GUIDED NEEDLE BIOPSY, [**2142-12-7**]- Successful right lower lobe lung nodule biopsy.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without any immediate post-procedure complications.
Impression: No increase in small right pleural effusion, no pneumothorax and no new parenchymal opacity are present after CT-guided lung biopsy.
Multiple lung lesions are better evaluated on the CT scan of three days prior.
Moderate-to-severe cardiac enlargement with prominence of the left ventricle is unchanged.
No new pulmonary lesions are identified.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely depressed cardiac index of 1.3 L/min/sq meter.
The patient tolerated milrinone load well and was transferred to the CCU with stable blood pressure for further care of her heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo Haitian-Creole-speaking female who presented with shortness of [**Month/Day/Year 1440**] and unclear past medical history, revealed to have R pleural effusion, EF 15-20% on Echo, chronic PEs and R DVT, and pulmonary nodules on CT of unclear etiology .
Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: On admission the patient was complaining of shortness of [**Month/Day/Year 1440**] and was found to have a BNP in the 7535.
She was found on echocardiogram to have severe global hypokinesis, with etiology unclear and no focal abnormality.
Prior to this admission she was not taking any medications for her congestive heart failure despite being diagnosed with heart failure at [**Hospital 8**] hospital in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year and was found to have an ejection fraction of 24%.
She was observed on telemetry throughout her stay with baseline normal sinus rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions.
A cardiac catheterization on [**12-10**] was significant for no angiographically apparent disease in all vessels, a CI of 1.3, SVR 3015, and elevated biventricular filling pressures as well as PA pressures.
Her baseline SBP was 80s-90s, but she was asymptomatic without lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain or shortness of [**Month/Year (2) 1440**].
Pulmonary Nodules: Patient was noted to have multiple nodular opacities on admission CT scan.
Of note she also had a CT scan during her admission to [**Hospital 8**] hospital in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year at which time she was also noted to have "ground glass opacities, peribronchial thickening and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy as well as a small right pleural effusion."
She underwent CT guided biopsy of a nodule during this hospitalization which was negative for malignancy but showed reactive cells.
She underwent three induced sputum samples which were AFB stain negative for tuberculosis.
She will likely need a VATS biopsy as an outpatient for further investigation of these nodules.
Pulmonary Embolism: Patient diagnosed with subacute pulmonary embolisms on admission.
She had an elevated D-dimer at 4878.
She was also diagnosed with chronic right sided DVT.
Given the patient's prolonged illness and weight loss there was concern for malignancy.
The patient was also experiencing hemoptysis and vaginal bleeding.
Per her records from [**Hospital 8**] hospital it appears that the vaginal bleeding is chronic and was worked up with a transvaginal ultrasound in [**2142-5-22**] which revealed a 5 mm endometrial stripe.
She had a CT guided biopsy of her pulmonary nodules which was negative for malignancy.
She was seen by the pulmonary service who recommended that there was no contraindication to her anticoagulation given that her degree of hemoptysis was slight.
For the majority of her hospitalization she was anticoagulated with a heparin drip and ultimately transitioned to warfarin for chronic anticoagulation.
Abnormal CBC: On admission the patient was noted to have a lymphocytosis on differential with a normal WBC.
Differential diagnosis for a lymphocytosis is extremely broad and includes infectious, autoimmune, hypersensitivity, malignant and pre-malignant states.
Flow cytometry revealed non-specific T-cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma were not seen in specimen.
No etiology was found for her abnormal differential.
Abnormal Liver Enzymes: On admission the patient was noted to have a midly elevated LDH and alkaline phosphatase.
She also was found to have an elevated GGT.
On admission she had a CT scan which was consistent with acute cholecystitis.
Her enzyme abnormalities were attributed to congestive heart failure leading to hepatic congestion.
Given her lack of symptoms this was deferred to outpatient management.
Vulvar Swelling: On admission ER physical exam the patient was noted to have "multiple vulvar lesions."
The location is consistent with a Bartholin's gland cyst.
The patient reports that she has never had a mammogram.
Vaginal Bleeding: Patient with noted vaginal bleeding since initiation of anticoagulation for her pulmonary embolism.
In records from her previous hospitalization at [**Hospital 8**] hospital she was also noted to have vaginal bleeding and underwent transvaginal ultrasound which revealed a 5 mm endometrial strip no specific abnormalities.
She did have a pelvic exam during this hospitalization which revealed scant blood in the vaginal canal.
Hemoptysis: The patient began to experience hemoptysis after initiation of anticoagulation.
Patient did have a positive PPD during this hospitalization and currently has three negative induced sputums on acid fast stain.
Patient does have a number of pulmonary nodules and underwent CT guided biopsy which was negative for malignant cells and showed reactive cells.
Positive PPD: The patient was noted to have a 15 mm PPD at [**Hospital 8**] hospital in [**2142-5-22**].
While on a heparin gtt for her PE/DVTs as above, she was noted to have several episodes of hemoptysis.
This was discussed with infection control, who recommended placing the patient on TB precautions and ruling her out for tuberculosis with three induced sputum samples for acid fast stain.
Rash: Patient reported a pruritic rash on presentation.
On exam she has a rash on her back, chest and the soles of her feet.
The other above etiologies did not appear consistent with her presentation.
Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy 2.
Congestive heart failure 3.
Bilateral pulmonary embolism 4.
Vaginal bleeding 8.
Mitral regurgitation 10.
Tricuspid regurgitation 11.
Abnormal liver function tests 12.
Vulvar lesions 13.
During this hospitalization you were found to have an enlarged and poorly functioning heart.
You were also found to have blood clots in your lungs and in your right leg.
You underwent CT-guided biopsy of a pulmonary nodule, which was negative for malignancy.
Please call 911 or your doctor if you develop lightheadness, dizziness, chest pain, worse shortness of [**Date Range 1440**], bleeding that will not stop or any other concerning symptom.
If you develop lightheadedness or dizziness, please call your doctor.
You should also see an OB/Gyn doctor as an outpatient regarding your episode of vaginal bleeding and the mass you have noticed at your vulva.
