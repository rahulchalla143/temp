RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2137-12-15**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**2137-12-9**] ECG: [**Month/Day/Year **] fibrillation with premature beats, probably ventricular, after which on one occasion there is a ventricular paced beat.
Intraventricular conduction delay of right bundle-branch block type.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present.
Opacification in the left lower lobe could be atelectasis or pneumonia, with similar abnormalities though less severe on the right lower lung.
No pneumothorax.
[**2137-12-10**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls, and hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall and apex.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Severely dilated left ventricle with regional dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary disease.
Mild right ventricular dilation and dysfunction.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
[**2137-12-10**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study earlier in this date, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion appears to have increased.
Atelectatic changes are seen at the bases, though supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Mild to moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension .
Bibasilar alveolar opacity persists but decreased.
Interstitial edema improved.
There is no other change.
[**2137-12-14**] CXR: Compared to the prior study, there is no significant change in the ET tube, NG tube, pacemaker, and retrocardiac opacity.
There is no new infiltrate.
[**2137-12-16**] Transesophageal Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated with severe hypo/akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and mild-moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 25-30 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-12-10**], the distal anterior function is improved and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are lower.
Bilateral infrahilar and left lower lobe consolidations remain stable since yesterday's study.
Small bilateral pleural effusions remain unchanged.
Extensive areas of patchy opacities are again noted, but there is overall decrease in degree of pulmonary edema.
Thus, the current abnormalities most likely represent multifocal pneumonia and unlikely to represent just residual of pulmonary edema.
No appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 82020**] was transferred to the CCU from an OSH for respiratory failure in the setting of coronary artery disease and an echo which showed a depressed EF of 10% and 3+ MR. .
RESPIRATORY FAILURE This patient's respiratory failure was due to a combination of pulmonary edema from heart failure as well as a pneumonia.
His chest x-ray did not show significant congestion upon admission and there was no clear focal consolidation indicating pneumonia.
He extubated on [**2137-12-11**] but later that day had worsening respiratory status with copious secretions.
He was given Carvedilol and Lasix but was reintubated later that day for worsening respiratory failure.
The Digoxin was dose at 0.125mg/day due to renal dysfunction.
He was febrile on and off during his treatment for presumed pneumonia based on chest x-ray.
FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS This was believed to be due to his pneumonia.
He had no other sputum cultures that were positive.
He has a persistent leukocytosis with WBCs of 16 on [**2137-12-17**].
He had been afebrile for days.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS Mr. [**Known lastname 82020**] experienced severe delirium during this hospitalization.
His delirium was managed with Haldol and Seroquel PRN.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE Mr. [**Known lastname 82020**] had known coronary artery disease involving 3 vessels.
An ACE inhibitor was not given due to his poor renal function.
He experienced no chest pain or anginal symptoms during this hospitalization.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE Mr. [**Known lastname 82020**] experienced severe heart failure during this admission which was complicated by his 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] fibrillation with lack of [**Last Name (Titles) **] kick.
He initially required Levophed on arrival due to hypotension but this was quickly weaned off on the day of transfer.
His heart failure was managed with diuretics and carvedilol.
An ace inhibitor was not given initially due to poor renal function but was resumed on discharge.
He had an echo which showed an LV thrombus and was also in [**Known lastname **] fibrillation which were reasons for his anticoagulation.
ANEMIA Mr. [**Known lastname 82020**] was anemic with a hematocrit of 26.5 on admission.
There was no clear source of his anemia.
Iron studies were checked and showed a low iron of 19 with a low TIBC and low transferritin but normal ferritin.
He had no guaiac positive stool during this admission.
RENAL FAILURE Mr. [**Known lastname 82020**] had a creatinine of 2.3 on admission which rose as high as 2.5 on [**2137-12-16**] and was 2.1 on discharge.
He seemed to have baseline chronic kidney disease based on old laboratory data.
DIABETES MELLITUS Mr. [**Known lastname 82020**] was placed on an insulin sliding scale on admission.
