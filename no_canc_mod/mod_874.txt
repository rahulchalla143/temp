Patient originally presented for EBUS with transbronchial biopsy of known hilar mass.
However, the patient's post-procedure course was complicated by hypercarbia and SOB, which necessitated observation in the SICU.
However, during this course, the patient became hypertensive.
The patient also has known afib but had not been anticoagulated given the recent procedure.
He did not complain of any residual pain, though he did have blood tinged sputum.
Has remote hx of cigar smoking.
No current alcohol or tobacco.

Bronchial biopsy: negative for malignant cells.
CXR: FINDINGS: Compared with 11/20, allowing for interval development of atelectasis at the left base medially, no obvious significant interval change in the small left pleural effusion is appreciated.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo M with h/o CAD/CABG, afib, HTN, lung dz with perihilar mass, s/p transbronchial biopsy complicated by hypercarbia and HTN, who presented from the SICU for post-procedure management and observation.
P: Nodule s/p biopsy.
A bronchoscopy was performed with sampling of the mediastinal lymph nodes, and bronchial washings were obtained as well.
Anemia: Pt had acute hematocrit drop after the procedure, likely secondary to acute blood loss anemia.
He had an active type and screen.
SOB/hypercarbia/s/p biopsy: Patient likely had hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to oversedation, initially but had persistent hypoxia after discharge to the floor which was felt to be secondary to baseline restrictive and obstructive lung disease, with also component of anemia and recent bronchoscopy with resultant atelectasis.
He was ruled out for an MI in the SICU with negative cardiac enzymes and no EKG changes.
His atrial fibrillation was rate controlled and stable.
For his CAD and hypertension, his lisinopril dose was uptitrated.
