Admission Date:  [**2111-12-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-1-21**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**] Chief Complaint: transfer with cholangitis for ERCP  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation, PICC line placement, ERCP   History of Present Illness: 85 yo female transferred from OSH.
In the OSH ED, the patient was noted to be tachycardic and febrile to 101 with a bilirubin of 11.3 and increased alkaline phosphatase.
CT abdomen and ultrasound demonstrated gallstones, gallbladder sludge, and a soft tissue density causing obstruction of the distal common bile duct with biliary ductal enlargement.
Blood cultures grew gram negative rods (later identified as klebsiella) and enterococcus.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, the patient complained of diffuse frontal headache, which resolved w/o any intervention, soreness in her left shoulder and a transient episode of nausea.

Blood gram negative rods and gram positive cocci in pairs from aerobic and anaerobic bottles.
Gram positive rods from anaerobic bottle.
There are no filling defects or strictures seen within the common bile duct.
[**1-4**] MRCP: Within the limits of this non-contrast examination, the parenchymal morphology of the pancreatic head/ampulla appears normal, and there is no evidence of pancreatic ductal dilatation.
No evidence of intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, although evaluation of CBD may be limited by the presence of biliary stent.
Sacral decubitus ulcer.
Endometrial thickness which appears thicker than expected in a patient of this age.
Bowel  and fat-containing left abdominal wall hernia.
Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Small right-sided pleural effusion.
[**1-6**] CT Abd pelvis with contrast: Ttwo focal areas of fluid seen adjacent to the greater curvature of the stomach.
Both fluid collections contain small surrounding soft tissue rim (focal collections of abdominal fluid vs abscess)  [**1-13**] KUB: No evidence of bowel obstruction or free air  [**1-18**] CXR PA/lateral: Moderate CHF.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Superimposed pneumonia is not excluded   Brief Hospital Course: 85 year old female transferred from OSH [**12-30**] w/ cholangitis/Klebsiella sepsis for ERCP.
ERCP [**12-31**] was without evidence of biliary obstruction, but a common bile duct stent was placed.
1) Cholangitis, Klebsiella/enterococcus sepsis: CT Abdomen at outside hospital showed a soft tissue density either within the duct or as it enters ampulla most consistent periampullary carcinoma or sludge and debris in distal CBD.
ERCP here shows no pus, stone, or mass.
MRCP (limited study) was without mass or biliary/pancreatic ductal dilatation, although it did show cholelithiasis (should have outpatient cholecystectomy).
Further work-up for other causes of LFT abnormalities include HBV panel (negative),  HCV Ab (negative), AMA (negative), HAV IgM (negative), and RUQ ultrasound (no evidence of hepatic/portal thrombosis).
An Abdomen CT showed 2 small fluid collections along the curvature of the stomach; it was unclear whether these represented abscesses or focal collections of abdominal fluid.
2) Acute renal failure: On [**1-13**], the patient's creatinine rose to 1.3 from 0.7.
FeNa was 3%, not consistent with a pre-renal etiology and urine eosinophils were negative, making acute interstitial nephritis less likely.
Her acute renal failure may be related to antibiotics (vancomycin vs ciprofloxacin), of which she has completed her course.
3) Congestive heart failure: The patient was diuresed with resolution of hypoxia - 95% RA at time of discharge.
Lisinopril had been started, but was held in the setting of acute renal failure (see above).
Cardiac enzymes were cycled, which were not consistent with myocardial ischemia  4) Atrial fibrillation: The patient had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR while in the ICU, most likely related to hypoxia/stress.
On the general floor, she remained in sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs.
6) Poor oral intake: The patient was noted to have a poor appetite, which her family reports is a chronic issue.
8) V-tach: in ICU had 20 beat run of hypotensive V-tach.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: [**1-26**] neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Discharge Instructions: 1) Please follow-up as indicated below 2) Please see your primary care physician or come to the emergency room if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, abdominal pain, or other symptoms that concern you.
