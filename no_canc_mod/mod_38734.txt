Admission Date:  [**2160-9-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-9-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-3-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: atenolol / Serax / Neurontin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**] Chief Complaint: GI Bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD ([**2160-9-7**])  History of Present Illness: 40 year old man with PMH of alcohol abuse, withdrawal, DT, alcoholic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, HTN, depression, polysubstance abuse, GERD, tobacco abuse, and withdrawal seizures from stopping Xanax presents with sudden onset of chest and abdominal pain at 3 AM yesterday AM waking him from sleep, with associated nausea and dry heaves.
Ultimately, he had two episodes of vomiting bright red blood, as well as having some watery diarrhea.
he denied any blood int he stools or black stools, and endorsed feeling week or dizzy.
He also endorsed some mild SOB.
His ROS at that time notable for a rash on the bilateral lower extremities.
His admission labs were notable for a glucose of 175 and a BUN of 20.
His OSH imaging showed a CXR with no acute disease, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis showing some gallbladder wall thickening, hyperemia and inflammatory changes suspicious for acute cholecystitis, as well as some mild fat stranding around the pancreatitis head, with a stable pseudocyst in the region of the pancreatic tail.
RUQ u/s showed thickening gallbladder wall up to 1 cm with a small amount of pericholecystic fluid.
No cholethiasis and no definite son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 90875**] sign.
normal caliber CBD and possible minimal intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
EKG at OSH showed sinus rhythm 70, no ST changes.
From his elevated WBC count, e was started on Unasyn and Flagyl, and ultimately sent here on Vancomycin, Metronidazole, and Meropenem.
Review of systems: Unable to answer   Past Medical History: Alcohol abuse Alcohol withdrawal Delirium tremens Alcohol pancreatitis pancreatic pseudocyst anxiety and depression hypertension polysubstance abuse GERD Tobacco abuse withdrawal seizures from stopping Xanax   Social History: The patient lives at home with his girlfriend.
General: sedated HEENT: nasal passageways with clot in the nares bilaterally Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: mild TTP in the epigastrium, without rebound, without hard surgical abdomen.
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema .
There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Left lower lobe consolidation is associated with pleural effusion.
Findings consistent with worsening pancreatitis including increased peripancreatic stranding and increased small volume ascites.
New small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Wall thickening of the second and third portions of the duodenum are likely reactive.
Bilateral renal hypodensities, some of which are simple cysts and others that are too small to characterize.
1 cm hypodensity in the right hepatic lobe adjacent to the gallbladder fossa is likely a region of focal fat deposition versus a perfusional anomaly.
Small segment V liver hemangioma.
Splenic infarct.
Pancreatic tail pseudocyst.
Trace ascites seen on CT two days prior not evident on ultrasound.
EDG ([**2160-9-7**]) -Blood in the esophagus -Ulcers in the middle third of the esophagus and lower third of the esophagus -[**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear -Diffuse ulceration and fibrin deposition was seen in the stomach.
The fundus had a large diffuse area of ulceration, adherent clot and fibrin deposition.
There were some areas that appeared to resemble a mass although it was not possible to distinguish a mass from inflammatory tissue and fibrin deposition.
-Ulcers in the antrum, pylorus and stomach body -Ulcers in the duodenal bulb, second part of the duodenum and third part of the duodenum -The etiology of the diffuse, severe ulceration is unclear and could represent a malignant process (ZE syndrome), ischemic event or caustic intake.
[**2160-9-11**] Repeat EGD Severe gastropathy consistent with portal hypertensive gastropathy Large areas of superficial serpiginous ulceration were noted in the body and fundus.
There was a large area with dusky-black appearance with thickening of the mucosal folds noted in the fundus -  differential diagnosis necrosis of gastric mucosa, gastric varices or an underlying infiltrative process.
Mild duodenitis in the duodenal bulb.
Brief Hospital Course: 40 year M with PMH alcohol abuse, withdrawal, DT, alcoholic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst who presents with upper GI bleed after chronic NSAID and energy drink (MONSTER) intake.
# GI Bleed Patient was evaluated by GI and underwent a EGD which revealed diffusely eroded edematous gastric mucosa with central black membranes v. clot in the fundus but no definitive bleeding site.
He had erosive esophagitis, esophageal/gastric/duodenal ulcers to the 3rd part of duodenum, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Tear.
No Bx were done initially b/c of low Platelet.
There was still erosive changes seen.
He was instructed on NSAID/ASA and Monster/Other energy drink avoidance.
He did not have an oxygen requirement upon transfer to the general medicine floor.
# Abnormal CBC (thrombocytopenia, anemia, possible hemolysis): The patient was noted to have a leukocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia.
No blasts were seen in his WBC differential, but there were bands at the outside hospital, and the elevated counts were attributed a possible infection v. pancreatitis.
Hematology was called regarding his thrombocytopenia and undetectable haptoglobin on admission (suggesting a consumptive/hemolytic process).
Upon review of his smear, they saw evidence of few schistocytes which raised their concern for possible TTP.
Upon further discussion, it was decided not to initiate plasmapheresis and to monitor the patient closely.
Given his low platelet counts, there was also concern for possible ITP and the patient was started on steroid therapy.
# Pancreatitis and pseudocyst: The exact etiology of his pancreatitis was unclear, though NSAIDs were high on the differential.
His RUQ u/s demonstrated no gallstones, though there was presence of biliary sludge (which can also cause pancreatitis).
# Tobacco use:  He was placed on nicotine patch and encouraged to stop smoking to allow his GI ulcers faster healing.
)(s)* Refills:*0* 3. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Severe pancreatitis Pancreatic pseudocyst Thrombocytopenia, unspecified  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to ICU with bleeding from the upper intestinal tract (including esophagus, stomach and duodenum).
You required mechanical ventilation for a short period.
You underwent 2 endoscopies which showed irregularity of the stomach wall.
You were found to have low platelets (blood cell involved in clotting) of unclear etiology and were treated empirically with steroid medication under hematology consultation.
You were found to have pancreatitis and a pancreatic pseudocyst.
Biliary sludge was seen on imaging studies.
The pseudocyst will need to be monitored, and it is recommended you have your gallbladder removed in the future when you have recovered from this hospitalization.
Please continue to refrain from alcohol, tobacco use, caffeine use, use of any ibuprofen, motrin, advil, naproxen/naprosyn, or aspirin containing products in order to promote healing of your GI ulcers.
