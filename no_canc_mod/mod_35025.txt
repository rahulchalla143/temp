FINDINGS: There is an extensive amount of high-density material tracking around the cerebellum, as well as through the basilar cisterns.
Overall, this is consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There is no obvious area of greatest density to indicate a source for the bleeding.
Hyperdense material also layers dependently within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, and collects in the third and fourth ventricles.
However, there is no large ventricular outlet obstruction.
High-density material also layers along the tentorium cerebelli.
There are no other foci of intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no edema, shift of normally midline structures or evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.
There is no large mass effect associated with intraventricular and subarachnoid bleeding.
There is no other evidence of herniation.
There is no fracture.
There is fluid within scattered ethmoid air cells, but the sphenoid, maxillary and frontal air cells are well aerated.
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage along the base of the brain, and collecting within the ventricles, predominantly within the third and fourth ventricles, but also layering dependently in the lateral ventricles.
No evidence of outlet obstruction at this time, although a comparison with prior CT would be useful to determine interval change.
No mass effect or herniation at this time.
Opacification of scattered ethmoid air cells.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2107-5-29**] 2:36 PM SCAN FINDINGS: Non-contrast CT of the head demonstrates diffuse cerebral subarachnoid hemorrhage including blood products within the lateral ventricles, third ventricles and filling the fourth ventricle extending through the foramen of Luschka with subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right perimesencephalic cistern.
There is no significant shift of midline structures.
CTA OF THE HEAD: CTA of the head demonstrates a tiny 2.5-mm outpouching at the origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery suggestive of a tiny aneurysm.
The location of this aneurysm would be consistent with the pattern of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The remaining intracranial circulation demonstrates no evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis, aneurysm or occlusion.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage including right perimesencephalic cistern and fourth intraventricular hemorrhage.
2.5 mm likely tiny aneurysm at the origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
ECG Study [**2107-5-30**]  10:08:18 AM Sinus rhythm Nonspecific diffuse ST-T changes.
Unchanged appearance of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory infarction.
2 mm aneurysm at the origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery is again seen.
The posterior inferior cerebellar artery remains patent.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-5-30**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly higher and the severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation is slightly higher.
No cardiac source of embolism identified.
Unchanged appearance of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory infarction.
2 mm aneurysm at the origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery is again seen.
The posterior inferior cerebellar artery remains patent.
Expected evolution of right cerebellar infarction.
TRANSCATH THERAPY Study Date of [**2107-6-17**] 10:51 AM Evaluation of the right vertebral artery showed moderate stenosis at the origin.
The arteriogram demonstrated mild vasospasm.
5 mg of Verapamil were given IV via slow infusion, secondary to the vasospasm.
No new aneurysms, regions of flow-limiting stenosis or occlusions were identified.
The left internal carotid artery arteriogram demonstrated minimal vasospasm in the left lenticulostriate and MCA branches.
No new aneurysm is identified.
The left vertebral artery arteriogram demonstrated minimal vasospasm.
No new aneurysms are identified.
A right common carotid artery arteriogram was performed secondary to moderate plaque at the origin of the right internal carotid artery.
Mild vasospasm was noted.
Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of Fentanyl throughout the total intraservice time of 1 hour and 15 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2107-6-23**] 4:01 AM Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema have improved since [**6-21**].
Leftward mediastinal shift and opacification at the left lung base suggest left lower lobe collapse, present since at least [**6-6**].
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was received to the ED from OSH after c/o headache and neck pain at home.
Cardilogy consult was initiated in the ED for elevated troponins.
It revealed a Right PICA aneurysm.
Her L EVD was dc'd without difficulty.
She underwent an attempted coiling on [**6-10**] of her right vertebral artery but it was unable to be accessed.
On [**6-12**], patient had a right cerbellar infact that was not previously seen on CT. Neuro suspected that the infarct may have occluded the PICA and the aneurysm.
[**6-13**], CTA showed patency of PICA and planning for open coiling or clipping of PICA aneurysm started.
Her repeat head CT shows slight increase in lateral ventricle size, but stable.
She tolerated the procedure well and her post-op head CT show no new hemorrhage however she did have further evolution or R cerebellar infarct.
On [**6-17**], angiogram showed good clip placement with mild vasospasm.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever pain .
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for thrush.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
?Please return to the office in [**8-5**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
