Admission Date: [**2194-4-24**]        Discharge Date: [**2194-7-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2126-1-15**]        Sex:  F  Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old female with a past medical history of morbid obesity, noninsulin- dependent diabetes mellitus and ulcerative colitis.
She initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital with a diagnosis of toxic megacolon following colitis which required a total colectomy and end ileostomy.
The patient had a protracted course at this hospital requiring tracheostomy placement as well as percutaneous gastrostomy patient for persistent respiratory failure and nutritional support.
The patient was noted to have an open abdominal wound with a dehiscence.
She also had multiple areas of skin breakdown and a large sacral decubitus ulcer.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon arrival the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 98.9.
Her abdomen was soft and nontender with no evidence of peritonitis.
There was an opening at the inferior aspect of her wound which appeared to communicate with the perineal cavity.
At gastrostomy site there was a small open wound which was not draining any purulent material.
She had a VAC in place over her sacral decubitus wound.
She was noted to have 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities.
The patient was admitted to the ICU for supportive care.
The patient was noted to have fungal bacteremia which ultimately grew candidal species sensitive to fluconazole.
Her midline abdominal wound was also treated with a VAC.
I should also note that the patient upon transfer to [**Hospital1 **], 2 [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains were placed through the inferior aspect of her wound to drain any persistent collection which had developed from her gastric leak.
This was a very difficult task given her morbid obesity and extreme debilitation from her several months of prior illness.
She was treated with aggressive nutritional support with 2 grams per kg of protein per day to assist with her wound healing.
However, she continued to have slow healing of her wounds, including her midline abdominal wound, her sacral decubitus wound, as well as wounds in her axilla which were felt to be hydradenitis.
She also had wounds in her lower extremities consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum, a diagnosis of which she had in the past from her ulcerative colitis.
Her [**Last Name **] problem remained wound care and poor wound healing despite aggressive nutritional support.
Increasing her mobility was very difficult due to lack of patient motivation as well as her extreme debilitative state, as well as morbid obesity in addition to her extensive wound care issues.
Towards the end of her hospital course patient was noted to spike a fever and developed hypotension while on the floor.
Diagnosis ultimately of urinary tract infection was made.
This was later switched to caspofungin due to fluconazole resistance of her candidal species that grew out of her urine.
She was transferred to the ICU for a short stay.
The nurses on the regular [**Hospital1 **] felt that her wound care issues simply required too much time and involvement for which to adequately care, so she remained in the ICU for wound care.
Her mental status deteriorated with increased periods of worsening delirium and decreased responsiveness.
On [**7-19**] the patient was noted to be in acute respiratory distress with rapid atrial fibrillation and hypotension.
The patient required an emergent trip to the operating room for intubation under fluoroscopic guidance for ventilatory support for respiratory failure.
The patient's clinical status continued to deteriorate, requiring increased pressor support in a worsening metabolic acidosis.
However, she continued to deteriorate without signs of improvement, again with signs of multiorgan system failure.
Following this, the patient expired shortly thereafter and was pronounced dead on hospital day #84 presumably of multiorgan system failure secondary to gram-negative sepsis from Acinetobacter bacteremia.
