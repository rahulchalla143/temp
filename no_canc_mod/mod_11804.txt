Admission Date:  [**2127-1-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2127-2-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2067-1-31**]       Sex:  F  Service:  VASCULAR  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Discoloration and coolness of the left foot.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, type 1 diabetes with triopathy, chronic renal insufficiency baseline creatinine 2.0, peripheral vascular disease.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2126-12-7**] demonstrated right coronary artery dominant system with severe three vessel disease, left main trunk had 30% stenosis at the ostium.
The left anterior descending coronary artery had diffuse disease with a mid 80% stenosis.
The right coronary artery had a mid 40% lesion with diffuse disease into the posterior descending coronary artery with an 89% stenosis of right coronary artery and distal posterior descending coronary artery.
Echocardiogram done on [**2127-1-13**] demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with severe inferior posterior hypokinesis and akinesis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Chest examination lungs showed coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Peripheral vascular disease pulses femorals palpable bilaterally.
The posterior tibial pulse on the right was biphasic signals only.
The dorsalis pedis pulse on the right was palpable and absent posterior tibial pulse.
The forefoot was ischemic and cool to touch with diminished sensation.
Electrocardiogram was without ischemic changes.
Renal was consulted regarding her acute renal failure.
Recommendations they felt this was secondary to hypovolemia both to poor oral intake and diuretic use.
The abdominal MRA showed a mild and distal abdominal aorta appears to be within normal limits.
There is no significant stenosis.
The proximal celiac trunk or the proximal superior mesenteric artery with a single right renal arteries bilaterally.
On the right the run off showed good in flow without significant stenosis of the common iliac, external iliac, femorals, superficial femoral artery and popliteals.
A three vessel run off was identified with poor quality proximal AT and posterior tibial peroneal arteries.
There were multiple foci of moderate stenosis identified in the proximal half of each of the three vessels.
Anterior tibial and posterior tibial occluded at the level of the mid calf and the peroneal occludes in the distal one third of the calf.
There are multiple areas of mild to moderate stenosis along the AT length.
Posterior tibial occludes at the distal one third of the calf, collateral vessels are identified in the medial calf extending to the level of the ankle, which reconstitutes at the plantar arch.
The chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe consolidation/collapse with worsening left sided pleural effusion.
There was a patent AT through the calf with diffuse disease distally.
The posterior tibial and peroneal were occluded with reconstruction of the dorsalis pedis at the foot that is patent and two tarsal branches in the forefoot with incomplete arch.
Ischemic left foot secondary to tibial disease.
Type 1 diabetes with triopathy.
Bilateral lower lobe opacities, stable.
Hyperglycemia corrected.
