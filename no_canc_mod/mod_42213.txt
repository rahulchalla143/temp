Initial workup of his aortic stenosis revealed critical disease with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.45cm2, mean gradient 55mmHg, EF 55-60%.
Cardiac cath revealed nonobstructive CAD and patent stent.
He was then referred to [**Hospital1 2025**] for evaluation for TAVR and was found to have large annulus.
He met all inclusion criteria for COREVALVE/TAVR and was admitted on [**2181-8-19**] for the procedure.
Upon admission he endorsed SOB after walking [**12-11**] mile and climbing 4 stairs, lightheadedness when getting out of bed, and chest pressure when loading the car.

No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is mild perivalvular leak.
Moderate mitral regurgitation persists.
Rest of the examination is unchanged  DISCHARGE LABS:   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 69 yo man with critical symptomatic aortic stenosis, history of CAD s/p stent to midLAD and D1 [**2172**], HLD, DM, CKD, afib, HTN deemed not a surgical candidate for conventional AVR due to heavily calcified aorta, now s/p Corevalve.
Severe aortic stenosis admitted for COREVALVE.
Post-op ECHO on [**8-27**] showed a mildly dilated LA, markedly dilated RA, moderate symmetric LVH.
There is a mild resting LVOFT obstruction.
Mild (1+) AR/MR, mild PAH.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Diastolic heart failure - NYH Class II, LVEF >55%.
Atrial fibrillation: went into LBBB and afib during procedure, but now natively conducting without narrow complex QRS.
Sotalol was held for bradycardia and was not restarted prior to discharge.
CAD - (stent to midLAD and D1 [**2172**], patent), losartan, ASA, vytorin and plavix as above.
HLD - continue ezetimibe/simvastatin, and heart healthy diet.
Simvastatin dose was reduced secondary to med interaction.
HTN - as noted above, he was initially on nitro gtt for elevated blood pressures and then Losartan was restarted as above.
DM - home metformin held, and he was started on insulin sliding scale while hospitalized.
Eye Pain: When patient was extubated, he complained of eye pain, likely due to corneal abrasion.

Groin restrictions - no lifting >10 lbs x 1 month post procedure   Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 112298**],      It has been a pleasure working with you in the treatment of your severe aortic stenosis.
Postoperatively you demonstrated some changes on your EKG [**Location (un) 1131**].
Electrophysiology specialists were consulted, an EP study was done which demonstrated no indication for further intervention.
