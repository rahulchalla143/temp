Admission Date:  [**2177-3-29**]       Discharge Date: [**2177-4-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2106-9-3**]       Sex:  M  Service: HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 620**] is a 70-year-old right-handed male with history of hypertension (diagnosed five years ago), diabetes mellitus (since two years ago) and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin for one month now, who underwent elective cardioversion at [**Location (un) 511**] observed overnight and discharged around 4 p.m. the next day.
CT scan was negative for hemorrhage.
He was also given Labetalol for elevated blood pressures to 192/109 mmHg.
He had a left gaze preference and a flaccid right arm.
ALLERGIES:  The patient does not have any drug allergies.
He had no carotid bruits.
CARDIAC:   Cardiac examination revealed regular rate and rhythm without any clicks or murmurs.
He occasionally said no to questions, but had no other speech output.
Eyes were mid position with occasional roving movements.
He was able to move to the left with ocular cephalics, but not to the right.
He had right facial droop.
There was minimal internal rotation of the right shoulder to noxious stimulus.
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the left upper extremity and knee and absent on the right.
MR imaging of the brain revealed a large area of restrictive diffusion in the left frontal temporal parietal lobes consistent with a left MCA territory infarct on DWI series.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 620**] is a 70-year-old gentleman with a large left MCA infarct after 30 hours after elective cardioversion for atrial fibrillation, was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 Neurology Service for further assessment and management of left MCA territory infarct.
Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed dilated left atrium; mild spontaneous echocontrast seen in the body of the left atrium; mild spontaneous echocontrast was seen in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus was seen in the left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echocontrast or thrombus was seen in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage.
There was significant regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities included akinesis of the mid and distal anterior and septal walls and apex.
The mid and distal inferior walls were hypokinetic.
The ascending, transverse, and descending thoracic aorta were normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaques.
The aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation was seen.
There was mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.
There was no clear effusion.
The patient, on admission, also had elevated creatinine kinase and troponin levels.
The patient also had gastrointestinal prophylaxis with Ranitidine.
On Apri 4th, [**2176**], the patient was still having atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and premature ventricular contractions or aberrant ventricular conduction with long QTC intervals and left axis deviation.
However, that night he developed some gastric hemorrhage and later on started having low blood pressures.
However, consequently the mental status started declining and he became somnolent.
The CT scan revealed increasing edema and midline shift most probably secondary to hypotonic fluids, diffusing into the large stroke area.
He was started on monitor and over the course of three days, edema and midline shift corrected and his neurological condition improved dramatically.
We wre awaiting input from neurology re: when this would be safe to do as there was concern re: risk of hemorrhage into the CVA at this time.
pt was on vanco for MRSA in sputum and flagyl and levaquin for aspiration pneumonia during his stay.
