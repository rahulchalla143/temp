Fevers, Line infection .
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old man with a history of ESRD on HD, DMII, HCV who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from home complaining of "not feeling right".
He had nausea and one episode of vomiting.
He mentioned some of his symptoms at [**Hospital1 2286**] but it is not clear if anything such as blood cultures were done at that time.
He also noted that he began feeling lower back pain which was new.
Type 2 diabetes times 16 years.
End stage renal disease secondary to diabetes, currently on hemodialysis.
History of deep venous thrombosis and superior vena cava thrombosis 5.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 40 percent in [**2145-8-27**].
Elevated homocysteine.
VS: Tm 101.4 Tc 96 BP 102/63 HR 76 RR 25 Sat (100% on 2L in ED)  Gen: Man in no apparent distress, somewhat uncooperative HEENT: OP clear, MM, PERRL, sclerae anicteric Neck: Scars from R IJ tunneled cath, CV: nl s1/s2, no m/r/g Pul: Crackles in bilateral lower lung fields Abd: Soft, NT, ND, +BS Back: No midline tenderness Ext: L femore tunneled cath, no purulence or tenderness Neuro: A&Ox3 .
There is a catheter projecting over the mid abdomen likely into the IVC.
There is a very large right-sided pleural effusion, which is partially loculated along the right lateral chest wall, which is unchanged from the prior study.
The right side down decubitus view demonstrates some layering of the fluid; however, a LEFT side down decubitus view would be best for evaluation of the pleural fluid.
There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema.
There is a large right pleural effusion.
There is no free air under the diaphragm.
IMPRESSION: 1)  No obstruction.
2)  Large right pleural effusion.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2148-8-21**], mitral regurgitation is now more prominent and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
As noted in the prior report would consider diagnosis of amyloid versus hypertensive heart disease.
No vegetation identified but cannot exclude.
Extensive venous disease in the infrarenal inferior vena cava, left common iliac and left external iliac veins.
There is no apparent venous inflow from the right iliac system.
This will likely preclude any further de [**Last Name (un) 11083**] placement of transfemoral approach lines or catheters.
This patient may be served with placement of a stent within the narrowed segment of the infrarenal inferior vena cava and or left common and external iliac veins.
Status post venous angioplasty in the infrarenal abdominal aorta and left external iliac artery.
Removed catheter tip sent for microbiology.
Chest xray, [**2148-9-17**]: Right-sided pleural thickening and subpleural atelectasis are chronic since at least [**2147-12-28**].
Since [**9-14**], a large right pleural effusion has reaccumulated.
Atelectasis at the base of the left lung is unchanged.
There is no interstitial pulmonary edema.
EKG, [**2148-9-14**]: Sinus rhythm; Indeterminate axis; Intraventricular conduction delay; Possible anterior infarct - age undetermined; Generalized low QRS voltages; Since previous tracing of [**2148-1-16**], no significant change .
No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis on this non-enhanced study.
Question of elongation of intra-articular region at L5 level could be to spondylolysis.
EGD: Esophagus: Mucosa: Esophagitis with ulceration and no bleeding was seen in the lower third of the esophagus .
Protruding Lesions A single nodule with some supoerficial erosion was seen in the gastroesophageal junction.
Not biopsied because of elevated INR.
Other Whitish exudate was seen in the esophagus Stomach: Other Small thickened fold was seen with some erythema in the body of the stomach Duodenum: Other A small thickened fold vs nodule was seen in the duodenal bulb.
Impression: Esophagitis in the lower third of the esophagus Nodule in the gastroesophageal junction A small thickened fold vs nodule was seen in the duodenal bulb.
Small thickened fold was seen with some erythema in the body of the stomach Whitish exudate was seen in the esophagus Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: PPI Repeat EGD with biopsy of the esophageal nodule when INR is lower Follow Hct   Brief Hospital Course: .
This is a 55 year old man with a history of ESRD on HD, DMII, HCV admitted to the MICU after tunneled fem line infection and hypotension requiring pressors in the unit.
Blood cxs revealed [**4-30**] Coag Neg Staph with antibiotics were narrowed to Vancomycin QHD.
The patient had a low blood pressure at baseline, however dopamine was required for hypotension (80s/60s).
A Cortisol stim test was performed to evaluate for adrenal insufficiency and the patient did not respond appropriately.
He was transferred to the general medicine [**Hospital1 **] after his hypotension resolved and his pressors were weaned.
Sepsis/Line Infection: The most likely source for his sepsis was the HD cath (prior to this admission, last changed 1 yr ago).
Vomiting/esophageal nodule/ulceration: Towards the end of his hospitalization, the patient had nausea and vomiting intermittently.
A KUB showed no abdominal pathology.
The DDx included diabetic gastroparesis vs. PUD vs mesenteric ischemia.
Given the absence of abdominal pain and a neg FOBT, mesenteric ischemia was low on the differential.
The epigastric burning and tenderness made PUD a possible cause.
The patient had a previous EGD which showed Barrets esophagus.
The current EGD showed esophagitis and a nodule in the GE junction.
As the patient had no vomiting in > 72 hrs and was tolerating PO, it was thought that he was ready for discharge.
Worsening effusion/consolidation on chest xray: The patient has had a persistent R sided effusion for years which has been tapped multiple times, showing transudative fluid.
In [**2145**] a pulmonary consult was obtained which recommended no further taps and no pleurodesis.
As the patient was felt to be only minimally symptomatic with occasional SOB, it was decided that tapping the fluid would be of minimal utility and was not done.
The sliding scale was adjusted down secondary to episodes of hypoglycemia and decreased PO intake from vomiting.
Possible Adrenal insufficiency: As the patient did not respond appropriately to the [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test, he was started on hydrocortisone TID x 5 days.
The patient again became supratherapuetic on 4mg Qhs.
Due to very poor peripheral access, a midline was placed for his EGD and peripheral access.
Insulin Please resume your outpatient insulin regimen, Regular Insulin 5 units PRN hyperglycemia (high blood sugar).
3- Please call your doctor if you experience fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting.
