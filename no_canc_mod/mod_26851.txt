The patient has had extensive recent hospitalizations.
During the most recent admission, she was tx'd for hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory failure, recurrent multi-drug resistant pseudomonal pneumonia, (for which she completed a 21 day course of meropenem, altered mental status and rapid atrial fibrillation.
Although a chronic CO2 retained, pt left the hospital in no respiratory distress.
Remote history of pneumonia.
track in place CV: +s1+s2 irregular No Murmurs Resp: Coarse air movement anteriorly.
Abd: Tender over umbilicus and to the right of the umbilicus.
+R CVA angle tenderness There is some guarding.
No rebound tenderness.
There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities throughout both lungs, which have worsened and have more confluent opacification within the left mid-to-lower lung field.
There is a prominent retrocardiac opacity.
The patient has severe scoliosis.
These diffuse airspace opacities are nonspecific and could be due to a combination of extensive pulmonary edema versus infectious/inflammatory process.
Alveolar hemorrhage would also have a similar appearance.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
No evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
Continued pulmonary consolidations consistent with pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 71F with chronic respiratory failure secondary to influenza/ARDS, reccurent pseudomonal pneumonias, afib, bronchiectasis admitted with changes in mental status and hypercarbic respirator failure.
Her respiratory status was continuing to decline, and she also developed acute renal failure (oliguric), as well as thrombocytopenia and coagulaopathy.
It was unclear the etiology of her thrombocytopenia, and there was concoern for HIT or DIC.
