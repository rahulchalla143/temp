Admission Date:  [**2114-2-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-2-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-12-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**] Chief Complaint: Chronic mesenteric ischemia.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right common iliac to superior mesenteric artery bypass with 6-mm PTFE graft and reimplantation of inferior mesenteric artery into infrarenal abdominal aorta.
History of Present Illness: This 62-year-old lady has previously had a celiac angioplasty and stent about 5 or 6 years ago for chronic mesenteric ischemia.
This showed her celiac artery to be chronically occluded including the stent.
The inferior mesenteric artery had a 90% stenosis at its origin and there was a very large meandering mesenteric artery reconstituting the superior mesenteric artery at the takeoff of a replaced right hepatic artery.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2114-2-20**]): POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.
Pulmonary edema has improved since [**2-17**], but there is still a severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality that suggests a combination of residual edema and a widespread infiltrative process unrelated to cardiac decompensation.
Interstitial pneumonia, drug reaction, or chronic interstitial lung disease are possibilities.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the  descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally  normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral  valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 70202**] was admitted on [**2113-2-13**] for an elective Right common iliac to superior mesenteric artery bypass with 6-mm PTFE graft and reimplantation of inferior mesenteric artery into infrarenal abdominal aorta.Pre-operatively, she was consented, prepped, and brought down to the operating room for surgery.
She tolerated the procedure well without any difficulty or complication.
On the floor, she remained hemodynamically stable with her pain controlled.
She did develop an acute onset of SOB.
Stat CXR showed Pulmonary edema VS ARDS.
She continues to make steady progress without any incidents.
A diminished blood flow to your small intestine or colon is referred to as intestinal ischemia (is-KE-me-uh).
Intestinal ischemia can cause pain and make it difficult for your intestines to do their job.
In severe cases, loss of blood flow to the intestines can lead to damaged or dead intestinal tissue, not unlike what happens to the heart during a heart attack.
Intestinal ischemia may develop suddenly (acute intestinal ischemia), often as a result of a blood clot blocking the flow of blood to or from the intestines, or it may develop gradually over time (chronic intestinal ischemia), due to a variety of causes.
Signs and symptoms:  Although there are different types of intestinal ischemia, signs and symptoms are most often perceived as having a sudden (acute) or gradual (chronic) onset.
Signs and symptoms of acute intestinal ischemia typically include:  Sudden abdominal pain that may range from mild to severe An urgent need to move your bowels Frequent, forceful bowel movements Abdominal tenderness or distention Blood in your stool Nausea, vomiting Fever  Chronic intestinal ischemia, in which blood flow to the intestines is reduced over time, is characterized by:  Abdominal cramps or fullness, beginning within 30 minutes after eating and lasting for one to three hours Abdominal pain that gets progressively worse over weeks or months Fear of eating because of subsequent pain Unintended weight loss Diarrhea Nausea, vomiting Bloating  Chronic intestinal ischemia may progress to an acute episode.
If this happens, you might experience severe abdominal pain after weeks or months of bouts of pain after eating.
These arteries are the:  Celiac artery Superior mesenteric artery Inferior mesenteric artery  When the flow of blood through these arteries or their adjacent draining veins is altered, whether the change is acute or chronic, intestinal ischemia results.
Like other arteries in your body, any or all of the arteries that serve your digestive tract may be affected by an accumulation of cholesterol particles, scar tissue, calcium and other cellular debris (atherosclerosis), which narrows those arteries and restricts the amount of blood moving through them.
Atherosclerotic buildup can progressively reduce blood flow to your small intestine, your large intestine or both.
Chronic intestinal ischemia is often the result of atherosclerotic buildup.
Most of the time, acute intestinal ischemia is due to a blood clot that forms in your heart and then travels to one of your intestinal arteries.
Sometimes intestinal ischemia occurs because a portion of your intestine becomes trapped due to a hernia (strangulated hernia) or due to adhesions from a previous abdominal surgery.
Other times it occurs because of heart failure or low blood pressure.
This leads to an inability to absorb food and nutrients, resulting in bloody diarrhea.
If damage is severe enough, infection and gangrene may result.
Intestinal ischemia is often divided into several categories:  Colon ischemia (ischemic colitis)  Disrupted blood flow to the colon is the most common type of intestinal ischemia.
Signs and symptoms of colon ischemia are generally milder than with other forms of intestinal ischemia, and severe complications are uncommon.
For most people, colon ischemia appears as a sudden onset of mild, crampy pain on the left side of the abdomen.
What causes diminished blood flow to the colon isn't always clear, but a number of conditions can make you more vulnerable to colon ischemia:  Atherosclerosis:  Dangerously low blood pressure (hypotension) associated with congestive heart failure, major surgery, trauma, shock or life-threatening infection in your bloodstream (sepsis)  A blood clot in an artery supplying the colon  Bowel obstruction caused by a strangulated hernia, scar tissue or a tumor  Heart, blood vessel, intestinal or gynecologic operations  Other medical disorders that affect your blood, such as inflammation of your blood vessels (vasculitis), lupus or sickle cell anemia Some medications, especially those that constrict blood vessels, such as some heart, migraine or hormone medications  Cocaine or methamphetamine use  Vigorous exercise such as long-distance running  Acute mesenteric ischemia:  This type of intestinal ischemia usually affects the small intestine.
It has an abrupt onset and may be due to:  A blood clot that dislodges from your heart and travels through your bloodstream (emboli) to block an artery leading to your intestines, usually the superior mesenteric artery.
This is the most common cause of acute mesenteric artery ischemia and can be precipitated by congestive heart failure, an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) or a heart attack.
This type of acute ischemic episode tends to occur in people with chronic intestinal ischemia.
Impaired blood flow resulting from low blood pressure due to shock or heart failure.
This is more common in people who are critically ill and who have some degree of atherosclerosis.
You may hear this type of acute mesenteric ischemia referred to as nonocclusive ischemia, which means that it's not due to a vascular obstruction.
Aortic dissection , a partial tear in the main artery from the heart (aorta), which causes a separation of the layers of the aortic wall and bleeding into and along the wall of the aorta, thus reducing blood flow to the intestines.
Chronic mesenteric ischemia:  Chronic mesenteric ischemia, also known as intestinal angina, results from atherosclerosis.
The disease process is generally so gradual that at least two of the three major arteries supplying your intestines become severely narrowed or completely obstructed before you experience symptoms.
A potentially dangerous complication of chronic mesenteric ischemia is the development of a blood clot within a diseased artery, causing acute mesenteric ischemia.
Ischemia due to mesenteric venous thrombosis  Occasionally, a blood clot will develop in a vein draining deoxygenated blood away from your intestines.
A blood clot in a mesenteric vein may result from:  Acute or chronic inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) Abdominal infection Scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) Cancers of the digestive system Bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or diverticulitis Disorders that make your blood more prone to clotting (hypercoagulation disorders), such as an inherited protein deficiency Trauma to the abdomen Hormone therapy, which can cause a blood clot  Risk factors:  Many of the risk factors for intestinal ischemia are those associated with atherosclerosis and clogging of the mesenteric arteries.
These factors include:  Age (older than 50) High blood pressure (hypertension) Diabetes Elevated levels of blood lipids or fats Smoking Your risk is also higher if you have a history of atherosclerosis that affects blood flow in other areas of your body, such as your heart (coronary artery disease), legs (peripheral vascular disease) or the arteries serving your brain (cerebrovascular disease).
Other factors that can increase your risk of intestinal ischemia include low blood pressure, congestive heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, a blood clotting disorder, a hernia and previous abdominal surgery.
Risk factors for ischemia due to mesenteric venous thrombosis include extended bed rest, obesity, certain types of cancer, birth control pills, smoking, and a history of high blood pressure or heart disease.
When to seek medical advice:  Seek immediate medical care anytime you have sudden, persistent abdominal pain.
Also, see your doctor promptly if you have blood in your stool or if you have chronic abdominal pain after eating, especially if you're also losing weight unexpectedly.
