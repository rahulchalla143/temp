No epileptiform features were noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old woman with history of epilepsy since her 50's, with a number of breakthrough seizures over the past several years, now with two breakthrough seizures, intubated for airway protection.
She might have had additional focal motor seizures at home, of which she is not always aware, which could explain her worsening confusion over the past two days.
She has not recently weaned any medications, has no evidence of systemic illness, and no recent trauma.
Upon extubation, patient was slightly confused secondary to ativan and additional dilantin bolus that she had received however daughter reported that this was not unusual.
He recommended increasing the Topamax while keeping all other medications the same.
Patient had no subsequent seizures.
Patient returned to her baseline mental status and was discharged with instructions to follow-up with her neurologist as an outpatient within 1-2 weeks.
CV: Patient had peak troponin 0.14, CPK 191 and MB index 6.2 with normal EKG upon admission which likely represented stress-induced cardiac ischemia/NSTEMI associated with her seizure activity.
She remained asymptomatic during her hospital stay and warrants follow-up with her PCP and cardiologist for further work-up and evaluation.
No events on telemetry.
Pulm: Patient was extubated without complications and subsequently transferred from the ICU to the floor.
