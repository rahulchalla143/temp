On POD 2, patient experienced increased abdominal pain, her WBC was 14.8 and she was hypotensive to 66/44.
She developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with the heart rate to 150s.
She experienced one more episode of atrial fibrilation, and again responded to IV metoprolol.
She was fluid resuscitated and taken to the operating room at the outside hospital for an exploratory laparotomy on [**2151-11-5**] where she was found to have leaking cystic duct which was ligated.
An intraoperative cholangiogram was performed at that time and showed a common bile duct stone.
The arterial blood gas level was indicative of met-hemaglobenemia and patient subsequently received methylene blue.
Past Medical History: - symtomatic cholelithiasis - gallstone pancreatitis - paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the setting of acute illness - s/p laparoscopic cholecystectomy c/b cystic duct leak ([**2151-11-3**]) - s/p exploratory laparotomy, found cystic duct leak - tied off, intraoperative cholangiogram showed CBD stone, JP drain placement ([**2151-11-5**])   Social History: Patient is a single mother of a 6 week old infant.

The arterial blood gas level was indicative of methemoglobenemia and patient subsequently received methylene blue.
She was intermittently febrile in the ICU, and received antibiotics for treatment of potential pneumonia or bile infection.
On [**11-10**], she was extubated and transferred to the floor, where her JP drain continued to put out increasing amounts of bilious fluid.
For this reason an MRCP was performed on [**11-12**], which initially showed no leak but was later re-reviewed and noted to show a small leaks potentially from the cystic duct stump.
She was started on ciprofloxacin and flagyl on [**11-12**], and vancomycin was added on [**11-13**] after she developed C. Diff positive diarrhea.
The remainder of her time on floor, she remained afebrile with stable vital signs and her laboratory values were normal except for a stable elevated WBC count and an elevated alkaline phosphatase.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
