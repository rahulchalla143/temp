In EMS she reported SOB and feeling as if she would die then had PEA arrest.
Also had emergent femoral line placement.
Went on to have CT head, which revealed no acute process before being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Planned to be cooled again but patient developed an additional two PEA arrests in the ED during which she received atropine/epinephrine/bicarb and atropine/epinephrine/dopamine respectively with CPR.
Of note, patient has had flaccid tone on all exams and fixed dilated patients.
No heavy alcohol or illicit drug use per recent [**Hospital1 2025**] discharge  Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: VS: P 125, BP 107/72, RR 15, O2 Sat 100% (AC, 500, 15, 10, 100%)  GEN: Intubated, sedated, no spontaneous movements HEENT: Pupils midline, fixed and dilated, anicteric, OP not assessible due to intubation.
RESP: Coarse rhonchi bilaterally anteriorly, no wheezes appreciated CV: Difficult to appreciate over coarse breath sounds, tachycardic, no obvious murmurs ABD: Obese, soft, NT, ND, BS+, no organomegaly or masses EXT: 2+ woody edema in lower extremities bilaterally NEURO: No spontaneous movements, no response to voice, pain or painful stimuli, no withdrawal to pain, pupils fixed, dilated, and midline, no gag reflex.

The mediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.
No definite pleural effusions are present.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe atelectasis.
[**2145-10-11**] CT head w/o contrast There is global loss of the sulci and effacement of the lateral ventricles with only the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles visible.
This is consistent with global cerebral edema.
No acute large vascular territory infarct, shift of midline structure or acute large hemorrhage is present.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells show bilateral maxillary mucosal thickening.
There is no axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
No pericardial effusion, anterior mediastinal hematoma or evidence of aortic injury is present.
There is significant soft tissue injury in the anterior chest wall.
Ground-glass opacities within both lungs could represent infection, pulmonary edema, or pulmonary hemorrhage.
No large hematomas are seen in the soft tissues.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: The visible osseous structures show no fractured ribs.
There is a non-displaced incomplete fracture through the mid sternum.
Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities may represent edema, infection or pulmonary hemorrhage.
Diffuse soft tissue subcutaneous hemorrhage anteriorly.
No well marginated hematoma.
Non displaced partial sternal fracture.
Bilateral lower lobe consolidations, aspiration cannot be ruled.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 year old female with past medical history mostly notable for morbid obesity presenting with shortness of breath followed by PEA arrest requiring multiple rounds of CPR.
The etiology of arrest remained unclear but given dyspnea preceding event, PEA, ?
Given her instability and pressor requirement, full diagnostic evaluation with CTA chest was deferred and the patient was continued on empiric therapy with heparin gtt.
Given dismal neurologic prognosis following prolonged ischemic time with CT head showing diffuse cerberal edema and GCS of 3 on exam, goals of care were readressed with family.
