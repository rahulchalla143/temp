While in the ICU, the patient's clinical course remained relatively stable with the main issue as being pain control.
Ultimately due to pain control issues, the Chronic Pain service was consulted and made multiple adjustments in his pain medications to keep the patient's pain under control.
While in the ICU, the patient began to have daily temperature spikes up to levels as high as 102.9, which responded well to Tylenol.

Ultimately, the patient's pain was relatively controlled.
The patient also developed an area of pleural effusion on the left side above the area, where the spleen had infarcted.
