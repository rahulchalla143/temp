Admission Date:  [**2128-12-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2128-12-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2064-3-1**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  DIAGNOSIS:  Acute inferior myocardial infarction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year old male with a history of COPD who presented to outside hospital complaining of intermittent substernal chest pain for five days prior to admission.
On [**12-11**] the patient again developed substernal chest pain with radiation to the left arm that lasted for approximately five hours and resolved spontaneously.
On [**12-13**] he again developed chest pain that occurred intermittently throughout the day until he was brought to an emergency department that evening.
An EKG in that emergency department demonstrated 2 mm ST segment elevations in leads 2, 3, aVF with persistent pain.
His chest pain resolved after the administration of tenecteplase with some improvement of ST segment elevations on EKG.
At 7:30 a.m. on [**2128-12-14**], he had two episodes of chest pain with 1 mm ST segment elevations in leads 2, 3 and aVF again.
Intravenous nitroglycerin drip was increased and his chest pain again resolved.
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for failed lytic therapy after acute myocardial infarction as an indication for cardiac catheterization.
Esophageal stricture.
Status post carpal tunnel surgery.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father and two brothers died from myocardial infarction at ages between 60 and 80.
General exam revealed a lethargic, 64 year old male in no other distress.
Head, ear, nose, throat and neck exams revealed normal extraocular movements with no icterus.
There was no S3, no murmurs noted, no rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary exam revealed bilateral diffuse son[**Name (NI) 7884**] [**Name2 (NI) 1440**] sounds with expiratory wheezes.
There was mild decreased air entry bilateral bases.
Abdominal exam revealed an abdomen that was soft, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremity exam revealed warm extremities with intact pulses and no pedal edema.
The patient had right groin minimal hematoma status post sheath pull from the cath lab.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal with no motor or focal sensory deficits.
There were [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in leads 2, 3 and aVF with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in leads 1, aVL.
There was T wave flattening in leads V2 and V3 and Q waves noted in leads V2 and V3.
EKG #2 post lysis administration of TNK revealed normal sinus rhythm at 70 with 0.5 mm ST segment elevations in leads 2, 3 and aVF with T wave inversions in leads 2, 3 and aVF.
The patient continues to have PR prolongation at 220 msec.
Catheterization of the patient's coronary arteries revealed 90% discrete stenosis in the proximal RCA, tubular mid-RCA stenosis of 70% with normal acute marginal and normal distal RCA.
LAD had serial stenosis of the mid-vessel of 50% and 90% respectively with a "moth-eaten" appearance of the lateral lesion suggesting thrombus.
Left circumflex artery had mild diffuse disease throughout.
RCA was dominant with proximal 90% stenosis and mid-vessel 70% stenosis.
At the end of cardiac catheterization the patient was noted to have some periorbital swelling and questionable tongue swelling.
This was thought to be a dye reaction allergy.
The patient had altered mental status with drowsiness and lethargy after receiving intravenous Benadryl.
There was a concern for CNS bleeding as the patient was status post lytic therapy at the outside hospital with altered mental status status post cardiac catheterization.
An emergency head CT was performed which showed no intracranial bleeding.
