There was no associated shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.
When the pain did not go away, she called the ambulance.
In the ambulance she received NTG SLx3, which made the pain resolve.
In the ED, she was hypertensive to >200 and started on NTG gtt for chest pain and HTN.
While on the NTG gtt, she reported L arm discomfort/pressure and midsternal burning, which resolved with uptitration of the drip.
Initial EKG showed T wave changes in aVL, but repeat EKG later in AM showed TWI in II,III,aVF, and V3-V6.
D-dimer elevated to 0.61 so pt had V/Q scan which found low probability of PE.
Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath, she developed nausea which was treated with Zofran.
She complains of persistent nausea but denies chest pain, arm/jaw pain, shortness of breath, or diaphoresis.
Patient denies recent h/o anginal symptoms: no recent chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, etc.
She did have a similar episode of chest pressure 2-3 years ago, for which she was worked up for PE (CTA negative).
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

Brief Hospital Course: # CHEST PAIN: Pt with multiple cardiac risk factors including HTN, HLD, cigarettes and +FHx presenting with new-onset substernal chest pressure.
Initial EKG without changes at OSH, but repeat EKG showed TWI in II,III,aVF and V3-V6.
Patient's TIMI score was 5, putting her at 12% risk of death/MI at 2 weeks, and 26% risk of death/MI/urgent revascularization at 2 weeks.
Patient did well after cath, with no recurrence of chest pain or nausea.
It was felt that given that she had had SBP>200 at OSH, her chest pain was most likely [**1-28**] hypertensive emergency.
#.Nausea: patient c/o persistent nausea starting 2-3 hours prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] CCU.
No evolving EKG changes or increasing enzymes.
#.AFib: Per patient, she is no longer on Coumadin as her cardiologist found that she only has paroxysmal afib.
Given that her chest pain was most likely [**1-28**] hypertensive emergency ([**Last Name 788**] problem #1), she was discharged on Lisinopril in addition to her home Metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **].
Outpatient Lab Work Please check A1C and potassium on Tuesday [**2-9**] at 2:30p at Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 92136**] office   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Chest Pain Hypertensive urgency Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
