[**1-13**] EKG: Sinus rhythm.
Inferolateral ST segment elevation with reciprocal depressions in leads I and aVL, consider acute inferolateral myocardial infarction.
[**1-13**] Cath report (prelim): Successful thrombectomy, PTCA, and stenting of the proximal and mid RCA was performed with a 3.0x33 mm Cypher stent which was postdilated with a 3.5mm NC balloon.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral walls.
