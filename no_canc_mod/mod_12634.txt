HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) **] office complaining of disabling claudication of both legs, right greater than left that occurred after walking approximately 20 feet.
He had undergone arterial reconstruction with a right femoral to popliteal bypass approximately two years prior for claudication.
He also had a right iliofemoral bypass.
Each time he had some period where the claudication resolved, but recently the graft has thrombosed again.
The patient had undergone an MRA that revealed a small aneurysm of the infrarenal aorta with very diseased iliac vessels on both sides.
The profundas were noted to be widely patent and the superficial femoral artery on the left and the vein graft on the right were patent.
It was explained to the patient prior to the surgery of the increased risk with this type of operation especially when done for claudication alone.
Hypertension 2.
Coronary artery disease with possible myocardial infarction in the past.
Hyperlipidemia 5.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline serum creatinine of approximately 2.3.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1.
Right femoral to popliteal bypass, as well as a right iliofemoral bypass.
He was bolused with his epidural when he had some breakthrough pain and subsequently became hypotensive and desaturated.
The patient was then reintubated by anesthesia and was noted to be quite acidotic.
Electrocardiogram was also performed which revealed ST depression in leads V2 through V4 and T-wave inversions in 2, 3 and AVF with slight elevation.
It was based on this that the patient had officially ruled in for an acute myocardial infarction and he was then started on intravenous nitroglycerin, Lopressor.
He remained intubated and sedated for several days.
He was then transferred back up to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day #5 where he was maintained on a face mask of 50% due to his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and he was given aggressive diuresis.
He was intermittently confused and it was most likely felt to be due to mild hypoxemia and volume overload.
He remained hemodynamically stable however and did not require any pressors or intervention.
On postoperative day #6, he was noted to have copious amounts of diarrhea, up to about nine bowel movements a day with an elevated white count to 19,000.
Clostridium difficile culture was sent and it ended up being positive for Clostridium difficile toxin.
He has had no fluctuation in his blood pressure and has remained stable.
Disabling claudication secondary to significant aortoiliac disease.
Perioperative myocardial infarction currently stable and managed with postoperative beta blockade.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease currently stable with need for aggressive chest physical therapy.
