A CXR showed mild vascular congestion.

Her volume status improved and she had no oxygen requirement.
However, she still complained of SOB, so RHC with Swan Ganz was performed to assess volume status.
Given her elevated pressures despite Lasix and in the setting of a creatinine increase and low EF, the patient was transferred to the CCU for initiation of milrinone and IV Lasix.

Read by: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] V.  TTE [**2156-7-5**] IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity dilation with severe global hypokinesis.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left filling pressures.
The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was elevated at 21 mmHg.

Decompensated congestive heart failure with depressed cardiac output.

Cardiac perfusion study [**2156-7-7**] Final Report  RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:    10.1 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi Rest ([**2156-7-7**]); HISTORY: 75 yo woman with a history of CAD with prior MI and CABG referred for evaluation of chest pain and worsening left ventricular systolic function.
INTERPRETATION: The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue attenuation and patient motion.
Left ventricular cavity size is markedly increased.
Resting perfusion images reveal a moderate reduction in photon counts involving the mid anterior wall, mid anteroseptum, the entire distal ventricle and the apex.
Large, moderate severity resting perfusion defect involving the LAD territory.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 2470**] is 75F with history of CAD s/p STEMI, CABG in [**12/2155**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1, SVG Y-graft-diag, SVG-PDA), ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%), most recent estimate at 10% who initially presented with dyspnea on exertion for the last one month and chest pain for 2-3 days prior to presentation.
ACUTE ISSUES # DECOMPENSATED ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE (EF 10%): Prior to her CCU admission, she was being diuresed while on the cardiology service service.
Given her persistent shortness of breath without other signs of heart failure, right heart catheterization was performed and the patient found to have elevated filling pressures.
Her pulmonary artery systolic pressures were between 34 and 53, with a general trend towards lower values as she was optimized medically.
Although she did complain of some right upper quadrant pain likely related to her poor right heart function (in the setting of unremarkable transaminases), she did not develop peripheral edema.
Notably, her weight on admission to the CCU was 56.1kg (down from 58.3kg on [**2156-7-4**]) and her weight on discharge was 57.9 kg  Precipitants for this episode remain unclear but include the possibility of dietary indiscretion, new wall motion abnormality [**1-29**] another ischemic event, rapid atrial fibrillation (although pt well controlled in house), or worsening valvular disease (pt with with known MR).
Patient was discharged on the following mediations for her CHF: dobutamine drip, lisinopril 5mg, Dig .125 every other day, torsemide 40mg daily, spironolactone 25 mg daily, imdur 60 mg daily  # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: since CABG 1/[**2155**].
Her coumadin was initially held given the need for catherization and central line placement.
# CAD: On presentation to the hospital, the patient was ruled out with two sets of negative enzymes (MBI negative, mild trop elevation).
She denied chest pain at rest and there were no EKG changes from prior studies.
Cardiac perfusion study revealed a resting perfusion defect of the LAD territory.
#VAGINAL BLEEDING: While in house pt described some vaginal bleeding which she has had for a couple of weeks.
We did a pelvic exam and there was no cervical motion tenderness but there was blood in the vaginal vault.
This is concernding for endometrial cancer especially with her age.
The bigger issue here is of course her decompensated heart failure requiring inotropes however if the patient wishes this should be worked up further.
# Hyponatremia: Asymptomatic, mild.
Likely hypervolemic, though this may manifest in older women with abdominal fullness rather than lower extremity edema.
A1c 6.4%, indicative of degree of glucose intolerance.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -decompensated CHF: will follow up with cardiologist -Postmenopausal bleeding: concerning for endometrial cancer.
Consider having a pelvic u/s and or endometrial biopsy in outpatient setting.

You were admitted because of increasing shortness of breath over the month prior to coming to the hospital with a recent onset of exertional chest pain.
We found that your heart functioned had worsened, but there was no easily identifiable cause to indicate why- we concluded at the end of your stay that it was disease progression and worsening of your pre-existing heart failure.
We gave you medications to remove the excess fluid that was causing you to be short of breath and gave you other medications to help improve your heart function.
