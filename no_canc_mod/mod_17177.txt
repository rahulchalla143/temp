CT PELVIS W&W/O C   [**2125-2-11**] 11:15 AM FINDINGS: There is a large intraluminal filling defect within the urinary bladder, predominantly on the right, slightly adherent to the wall, measuring 6 x 5.5 x 5.3 cm.
This filling defect is heterogeneous in appearance and has irregular margins.
There is a Foley catheter within the urinary bladder as well as foci of air.
There is no evidence of significant retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Multiple small foci of hypodensity within the right renal parenchyma, most likely representing small cysts.
There is evidence of cholelithiasis.
There is no evidence of free fluid or free air.
There is a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, measuring 4.4 cm in maximum diameter at the inlet to the abdomen, after which it tapers to 2.5 cm at the level of the SMA.
Bilateral lung bases are unremarkable.
There are no suspicious bony lesions.
Large filling defect within the urinary bladder, which is heterogeneous, measuring 6 cm in maximal diameter.
Differential diagnosis includes a bladder tumor versus a blood clot given that the patient has been on Coumadin  ================  MICROBIOLOGY ================  URINE CULTURE (Final [**2125-2-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
female with known bladder tumor and mechanical Mitral valve, presenting with gross hematuria, now with stable Hct, s/p transurethral tumor resection .
# Hematuria / Bladder tumor: Although culprit for hematuria was a known tumor, intervention was not possible upon admission secondary to anticoagulation.
Patient has mechanical valve at the mitral position, for which she is anticoagulated with coumadin.
Continuous bladder irrigation was initiated and INR was allowed to drift down without reversal due to increased risk of adverse events in setting of mechanical valve.
# UTI: History of VRE UTI in the past.
This admission, patient had infection with streptococcus species.
# CAD: Patient is S/P MI with bare metal stent [**8-5**].
# Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: EF 40-45% on [**9-4**], following MVR.
# Carotid artery stenosis: Per ultrasound ([**2124-9-6**]) 80-99% right ICA stenosis, with no significant left ICA stenosis.
No neurological symptoms during this presentation.
Percocet 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 7 days.
