CHEST: There has been no significant change since the prior chest x-ray.
No areas of consolidation are seen.
Possible right atrial abnormality.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o F with a history of COPD on home oxygen (3LNC) and chronic prednisone, who initially presented to the hospital with dyspnea and two days of chest pain along with a cough productive of green sputum, diagnosed and treated for COPD exacerbation.
Active Issues: # COPD exacerbation: She has severe COPD (stage III) on home oxygen (3LNC) and chronic prednisone, who initially presented to the hospital with dyspnea and two days of chest pain along with a cough productive of green sputum.
On admission she was diagnosed with a COPD exacerbation, thought to be due to heat exposure as this has happened in the past and there was no evidence of pneumonia on her chest x-ray.
She was treated with prednisone 60mg and q2h nebulizer treatments however her symptoms progressed over her first two days in the hospital and she was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory distress on [**2124-7-8**].
There was discussion about keeping her in the ICU overnight for bipap titration, however as it was thought that she likely had a complex sleep apnea, so will need a full sleep study with titration prior to bipap initiation.
It was felt that she will benefit from inpatient pulmonary rehab for her significant underlying disease.
Inactive Issues # Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: See above for MICU details, she was diuresed with good effect in the ICU, appears euvolemic on exam at discharge.
# OSA: Likely contributing to hypercarbia in addition to her COPD, no bipap for now but will make sure outpatient sleep study is arranged on discharge  # Fibromyalgia: she was continued on home morphine, oxycodone, carisoprodol, gabapentin, ibuprofen.
TRANSITIONAL CARE: - Will need evaluation for BiPAP as an outpatient due to worsening hypercapnea and OSA.
Please confirm pt has pneumovax and influenza vaccine.
