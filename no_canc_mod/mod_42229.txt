There is questionable rim enhancement in postcontrast studies around the area is not certain if these are related to the patient's motion.
There is evidence of multiple prior infarctions.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mild depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include basal septal hypokinesis, inferobasal akinesis, with inferior and basal septal hypokinesis.
4.The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.
Parasagittal hemorrhage.
67 year old man with history of bilateral ischemic strokes, vascular risk factors, and hypertension who presented with worsening weakness, dysphagia, and speech 2 days after a fall.
Head CT was done and showed small left parasagittal hemorrhage.
MR of the brain was done but did not visualize the area of the hemorrhage because the bleeding was located above where the cuts were taken.
The differential diagnoses included hypertensive bleed, bleeding secondary to AVM, aneurysm, mass, or amyloid.
The patient underwent CT Angio on [**3-4**] which was negative for aneurysm.
The patient was loaded with dilantin on [**2-28**] for seizure prophylaxis.
The patient had urinalysis on admission that was c/w UTI.
He was initially started empirically on Levofloxacin which on [**3-2**] was changed to Zosyn after his urine culture grew resistant E coli and sensitive Klebsiella.
He spiked fevers up to 100.7.
On [**3-3**] CXR showed new LLL infiltrated and Clindamycin was added to cover aspiration pneumonia.
The patient has been afebrile since [**3-4**].
Initially, the patient had episodes of central and obstructive apnea with >20 sec frequent apneic pauses.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Patient received one unit pRBC for HCT 28 given h/o CAD on [**2-28**].
Hypernatremia - hypovolemic hypernatremia due to NPO and being on IV NS.
HCTZ was added to his medications for BP control.
Urinary tract infection 4.
Hypertension 5.
Diabetes 7.
