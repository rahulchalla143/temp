Admission Date:  [**2154-3-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-3-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-11-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vicodin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea and back/neck pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 78 DM, PAD known severe AS [**Location (un) 109**] 0.9cm2 mean gradient of 20mmHg, CHF EF 35-40% with regional variation, 3vd cath 1mo ago, RLE angioplasty/stent for poorly healing TMA now presents with dyspnea and pain.
Last evening around 10pm, she developed back/neck pain while at rest that subsided somewhat by trying to sleep/rest, but she awoke at 4am with wheezing, concerning enough to call her daughter and present to [**Hospital3 **].
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of frank chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: AS 0.9cm2, gradient 20by echo, 40 by cath Diabetes PVD Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Hypothyroidism SVT status post ablation Tachycardia, sinus PSH: Right TMA in [**11-3**] Left TMA in '[**51**] Left femoral/popliteal bypass in [**2151**] R femoral/popliteal bypass in [**11-3**] Thyroidectomy Right hip fracture  Social History: Tobacco Use: Former smoker Alcohol Abuse: No history of alcohol abuse.
Family History: Daughter with MI in 50s.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
LE U/S ([**3-3**]): No DVT of either lower extremity.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-1-28**], global left ventricular systolic function is more depressed (and apprears global) and the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed.
No discrete vegetations identified (does not exclude with deformed valves).
These findings are consistent with decreasing pulmonary [**Date Range 1106**] congestion and pleural effusions.
Some streaks of atelectasis persist, especially at the left base.
There is a vague suggestion of an area of increased opacification involving the right mid lung laterally.
TTE showed global LV systolic dysfunction and severe aortic stenosis.
She remained in sinus tachycardia in the 100-110s range, which per patient and daughter has been her baseline for at least 40 years.
[**Date Range **] surgery was consulted and felt this wound was not infected.
She had no evidence of acute ischemia during her hospitalization.
No evidence of leg DVT on ultrasound.
Her fever curve trended down and she had no leukocytosis.
Congestive Heart Failure Exacerbation 2.
Sinus Tachycardia 4.
Hyperlipidemia 5.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.
This was thought likely related to your congestive heart failure.
Please return to the hospital if you developed shortness of breath, chest pain, increased lower extremity swelling, changes in your weight, fevers, shaking chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, palpitations, or passing out.
