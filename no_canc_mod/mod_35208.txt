She was taken to an area hospital where she was reportedly alert and awake with no discernable neurological defecits and underwent imaging studies which revealed a small subdural hematoma, pulmonary contusion, possible C7 transverse process fracture, pelvic fracture, and open fracture of right foot.
Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
The size of the acute left parietal subdural hematoma is unchanged.
A low-density right frontal extra-axial collection is also unchanged.
There is soft tissue swelling in the right frontal region.
No bony abnormality is seen.
Scattered ethmoid opacification is noted.
IMPRESSION:  No change in size of subdural hematoma.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-5-31**] 9:47 AM CT HEAD: The size of the acute left parietal subdural hematoma is unchanged.
A low-density right frontal extra-axial collection appears slightly more prominent, though without new hyperdense material, which is consistent with a hygroma.
Soft tissue swelling along the right frontal region is improved compared to the earliest study; however, there appears to be new left temporal soft tissue swelling.
No underlying fracture is seen.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted in the sphenoid and left maxillary sinuses along with opacification of some of the ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: Acute left parietal subdural hematoma, unchanged.
Slight increase in right frontal low-density collection, consistent with hygroma.
New left temporal soft tissue swelling, without evidence of underlying fracture.
CT LOW EXT W/O C RIGHT  [**2165-5-30**] 2:35 PM FINDINGS:  Numerous comminuted fractures are present throughout the right mid and hind foot.
Multiple comminuted fractures of the first, second, and third metatarsal bases, with lateral and dorsal dislocation of the second metatarsal base, are consistent with a Lisfranc fracture-dislocation.
The fracture at the base of the second metatarsal also extends into the metatarsal shaft.
The middle cuneiform is relatively intact, with only several small avulsion fragments.
Through the body of the cuboid, there is an oblique, comminuted fracture.
The calcaneus demonstrates a longitudinal, moderately anteromedially displaced fracture along its plantar surface.
Finally, an oblique, intra-articular fracture extends across the base of the fourth proximal phalanx.
Extensive soft tissue edema and fat stranding is present circumferentially about the hind, mid, and forefoot.
There is no evidence of soft tissue entrapment in any of the fracture fragments.
Findings consistent with Lisfranc fracture-dislocation, with lateral displacement of the 2nd-5th metatarsals, but without displacement of the first metatarsal.
Additional fractures of the fourth metatarsal base, the calcaneus and the fourth proximal phalanx.
Because of her injuries Neurosurgery and Orthopedics were consulted.
There were no intraoperative complications.
Her small left subdural was managed non operatively, she was loaded with Dilantin and will need to remain on this for a total of 10 days.
She remained in a hard cervical collar because of the C7 transverse process fracture.
An MRI was done to assess for ligamentous injury; this was ruled out, the cervical collar was removed.
She was initially on IV narcotics for pain control and was later changed to long acting narcotics with shorter acting ones for breakthrough pain.
Her pain was adequately controlled with this regimen.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q3H:PRN as needed for breakthrough pain.
Dulcolax 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1)  Rectal once a day as needed for constipation.
Milk of Magnesia 800 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML's PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Motor vehicle crash Small left subdural hematoma C7 tranverse process fracture Right rib fracture Left pulmonary contusion Grade I liver laceration Left superior/inferior pubic rami fracture Right ankle/foot: open lis franc injury, calcaneal/cuboid fracture Right distal radius fracture   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: NEUROSURGERY D/C INSTRUCTIONS NOTIFY DR.
