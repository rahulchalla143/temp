Labs notable for ARF, with BUN 153 and Cr 6.3; leukemoid WBC of 46.8; anion gap acidosis (gap 29).
ED spoke to [**Hospital3 **] pcp [**Name9 (PRE) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name9 (PRE) **], who reported that he has 3-drug HTN; sometimes c/o nonspecific leg pain; last seen 2wks ago for reg visit, no specific complaints at that time.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Rads: [**6-1**] KUB - ileus [**6-2**] - Abd U/S - no ascites, possible cirrhosis [**6-2**] - CT abd - Small bowel dilatation up to 4.2 cm with relatively decompressed distal loops of small bowel and colon - pSBO vs. ileus, cholelithiasis [**6-4**] - KUB/CXR - free air under L hemidiaphragm and dilated SB up to 5 cm with decompressed loops distally.
Cecal perforation, 6.0 cm, with associated transmural inflammation and serositis.
Partial fibrous obliteration of appendix.
Brief Hospital Course: 53M with acute polyarticular arthritis and acute renal failure, also 3-drug hypertension and alcoholism .
Acute Polyarticular Arthritis: although joint distribution is not classic, polys and needle shaped crystals and negative gram stain on microscopy of joint fluid is c/w gout.
pt not complaining of pain at time and says he wants to avoid medications; rheumatology consulted, as presentation is atypical.
Gout symptoms improved, decreased swelling and pain.
Leukemoid reaction: suspect stress response from several days of acute inflammatory illness.
Liquid tumor is less likely, but must be considered, especially if WBC not responding to managements directed at inflammation.
Had some loose stool so sent for C. Diff although abdominal exam benign, and no known recent antibiotic exposure prior to presentation.
More concerning possibility was for underlying malignancy.
Differential notable for left shift without significant predominance of abnormal forms.
Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase was elevated - not c/w CML.
SPEP/UPEP sent given ARF and anemia and were... .
Acute renal failure: BUN:Cr ratio > 20:1 and pt has not been taking adequate po x5 days, highly suggestive of prerenal azotemia.
Metabolic acidosis and hyperphosphatemia likely secondary to renal failure with inadequate acid secretion also resolved with hydration.
Anemia: Hct low despite significant volume contraction.
macrocytic, no signs of active/obvious bleeding.
Suspect alcohol bone marrow suppression + iron deficiency.
Will need outpt colonoscopy--concern for underlying malignancy given anemia, and leukocytosis.
pt with odd affect and seems confabulatory, so will empirically replete thiamine, folate.
monitored per CIWA scale protocol- no signs of withdrawal noted during admission.
HTN: antihypertensives held durign early admission due to hemodynamic instability.
On [**2141-6-4**] General Surgery consulted for complaints of abdominal distension and emesis - treated as an ileus with an NGT and had dark bilious output from the NGT - put out 1-2 liters per day.
Also had elevated WBC, which was trended down from 40.
Heme-Onc attributed elevated WBC as reactive leukocytosis.
POD1-He continued with NGT, NPO, IV fluid hydration, and PCA for pain control.
Due to gout flare and associated pain, patient had difficultly mobilizing.
Both Physical and Occupation therapy were consulted, and recommended short term Rehab.
His abdominal incision developed some mild erythema, and serous drainage.
Erythema decreased.
There was no increase in WBC or development of fever.
On [**2141-6-13**], patient reports gout pain to have resolved.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain for 2 weeks.
Post-op ileus Gout flare Post-op urine retention Post-op surgical wound cellulitis .
