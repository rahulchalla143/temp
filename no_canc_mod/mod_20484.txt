Severe hyperemesis requiring Zantac, Reglan, Zofran and     Ativan and frequent admissions for this problem.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for maternal developmental delay with mild-moderate mental retardation, with history of maternal prematurity at 29-30 weeks and unremarkable genetic evaluation as a child; maternal mitral valve prolapse, asthma.
Positive pressure ventilation was given for 1 minute with improved heart rate and respiratory effort and tone.
Heart: Normal rate and rhythm, no murmur.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the NICU with the diagnosis of prematurity, rule out sepsis and respiratory distress syndrome, history of maternal developmental delay.
He had occasional apnea spells and desaturations with feedings, but was never treated with caffeine and has not had any concerning episodes for greater than 5 days by the time of discharge.
Cardiac: The patient was noted in the second week of life to have a murmur which on echocardiogram on [**10-20**], showed a small muscular VSD.
GI: The patient is noted to have an umbilical hernia and retracted testis on the left.
Initial hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin max of 19.9/0.7.
Repeat sepsis evaluation was performed on day 6 for hypothermia that was unremarkable.
Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall for all infants once they reach 6 months of age; before this age and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and home caregivers.
Finally, although this infant has appeared well throughout admission, some members of the care team questioned mildly dysmorphic features; given mother's developmental delays and dysmorphisms, a genetic evaluation of this family can be considered as an outpatient.
Sepsis ruled out.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy.
Mild anemia.
History of maternal developmental delay.
