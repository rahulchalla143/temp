Admission Date:  [**2192-10-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2192-10-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2140-6-29**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old male with newly diagnosed aortic stenosis following a workup of progressive dyspnea on exertion with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
The patient underwent an echocardiogram which revealed a severely reduced ejection fraction (20%) with global hypokinesis.
The patient's valve area was calculated at 0.8 cm2 with a mean gradient across the aortic valve of 35 mmHg.
The patient's aortic stenosis was further confirmed by cardiac catheterization.
The patient's coronary arteries were noted to be free of disease on the cardiac catheterization.
Severe aortic stenosis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None  ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
The hemi-arch grafting was deemed necessary when the patient was found to have a significantly dilated aortic root.
The patient was incidentally noted to have a large intra-abdominal mass during surgery.
On postoperative day two, the patient had an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and an Electrophysiology Service consultation was requested.
The recommendations from the Electrophysiology Service regarding the patient's nonsustained ventricular tachycardia included the additional of Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o.
On the night of postoperative day three, the patient had a second episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Management of the patient's alcohol withdrawal symptoms had been changed from Ativan p.o.
The patient had also been noted to have cloudy urine with a sample sent to the laboratory for analysis on postoperative day three.
The patient was noted to have a urinary tract infection, and antibiotic therapy was initiated.
The patient was noted to have a large intra-abdominal overt mass extending from the level of the medial portion of the right kidney into the deep pelvis.
The mass was noted heterogenic in density (indicating a possible cystic, necrotic, or hemorrhagic component).
No significant intra-abdominal adenopathy was noted.
The patient was also to follow up with his primary care physician for further management of his nonsustained ventricular tachycardia following discharge.
Severe aortic stenosis requiring surgical repair.
Urinary tract infection.
