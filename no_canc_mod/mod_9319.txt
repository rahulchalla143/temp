Admission Date:  [**2132-7-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2132-7-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2076-2-1**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old female with a history of lupus, who had 5-6 months of crescendo angina escalating to angina with minimal exertion while at work as a surgical Intensive Care Unit nurse at the [**Hospital3 28333**] [**Hospital3 **].
The patient was scheduled to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1445**] today and had chest pain while in his office.
At that time the EKG revealed diffuse T wave inversions in the precordial leads.
She was going to be a direct admission to the floor but she had recurrent chest pain and was admitted to the cardiac catheterization lab.
Upon further questioning, she reports that she had had 8 episodes of angina usually exertional over the last several months.
On two nights prior to admission she had midline chest pain radiating to her left neck at work but we cannot get a further history at this time due to patient's weakness.
Then upon arrival to the holding area, she had a bradycardic episode with systolic blood pressure decrease and unresponsiveness.
Prior to this, her EKG had persistent precordial T wave inversions with prolonged PR intervals.
During her rest she had a brief course of chest compression and was subsequently given Atropine which brought her blood pressure up to the 100 systolic and her pulse  up to 90.
She subsequently had recurrent chest pain [**1-20**] and bedside echo revealed no effusion.
Repeat was 27, although she had no physical evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
In CCU her blood pressures remained stable with systolic blood pressure in the 120's to 130's and a repeat hematocrit was done while we were waiting for the type and cross which returned at 32.
The patient remains chest pain free.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Pre-cath is significant for occasional palpitations, no left lower extremity edema, no PND, no syncope, positive occasional dizziness.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosed about 20 years ago by joint pains and pancytopenia during that flare.
She also had a history of seizures since a teenager but none times 30 years.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Her father died of an MI at age 46, mother has a history of Q wave MI, her brother has right bundle branch block and hypertension.
There is a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.
Abdomen soft, nontender, non distended, no flank ecchymosis.
Extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, 2+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally.
She has a right femoral hematoma about 2 cm in diameter with surrounding ecchymosis and a 2+ pulse.
Her echocardiogram showed an EF of 45-50% with mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] pulmonary hypertension.
LAD had severe proximal disease and 70% at the distal portion of the lesion, 95% proximal portion with appearance of a clot and/or plaque avulsion.
She also had a small diseased "side branch" diagonal I which was attempted but not entered.
RCA showed 60% mid lesion, 90% tubular lesion at the bifurcation into short PDA and posterior left ventricular branch.
Left circumflex showed a tubular 50-60% lesion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  56-year-old female with remote history of SLE, positive family history for coronary artery disease presents with crescendo angina and EKG with diffuse T wave inversion, status post catheterization showing three vessel disease with a stent to the LAD.
Post cath was complicated by a question of a vagal episode with bradycardia and a hematocrit drop from 42 to 32, likely delusional, however, there was concern for retroperitoneal hematoma.
Cardiovascular - Ischemia:  Her Integrilin was discontinued secondary to acute blood loss and concern of bleed.
