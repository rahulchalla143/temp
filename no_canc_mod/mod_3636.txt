Admission Date:  [**2109-8-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-9-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-6-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Augmentin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: Syncope/Chordae Tendinae Rupture of Mitral Valve   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left and right heart catheterization Intra-aortic balloon pump Mitral valve replacement  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 5874**] is a 45 y/o male with a history of syncopal episodes and holosystolic murmur who was admitted to the CCU after a 9 second asystolic pause in the emergency department.
The patient has a history of recurrent sinusitis and presented on the morning of [**2109-8-21**] to the hospital in [**Location (un) 620**] for scheduled ENT surgery.
While urinating pre-procedure, he became light-headed and syncopized.
An echo was done to work up his syncopal episode which showed severe (4+) mitral regurgitation and evidence of posterior chordae tendinae rupture.
Of note, his primary care physician stated in his note last [**Month (only) 205**] that he heard a new, loud, systolic murmur in the mitral area.
The patient was referred for an echo at that time, but there is no note in the system and his family cannot recall him having this study done.
Over the past few months, he has had armchair orthopnea and has been waking up several times per week short of breath and experiencing malaise (per wife, [**Name (NI) **] notes).
PCP note from [**2109-7-30**] also states chest pain and this symptom complex was attributed to bronchospasm [**3-7**] post-nasal drip.
When his blood was drawn for routine labs, the patient became nauseated and again syncopized, his heart rate subsequently decreasing into the 40s and then leading to 9 seconds of asystole, during which is SBP dipped into the 80s.
A STAT echo revealed severe MR, flail posterior leaflet/chordae, LAE, severe pulmonary HTN, mild pericardial effusion, RV hypokinesis, and an LVEF of 75-80%.
A chest X-ray showed marked cardiomegaly and congested pulmonary vasculature.
His cardiac index was 1.7 and an intra-aortic balloon pump was subsequently placed for cardiogenic shock.
He held his blood pressure well and his first cardiac index in the unit had increased to 2.6 with an SVR of 829. .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Unable to obtain given intubation, but patient's wife states that recently he has reported waking up several times a week short of breath over the past few months and general malaise over the same time period.

Patient was found to have severe mitral regurgitation with a flailed valve leaflet.
He was intubated and had a swan placed and was found to have a low CI (1.7).
Patient had aortic balloon pump placed because of low cardiac output and impaired forward flow.
We felt his mitral regurg was likely chronic given the progression of his EKG changes since [**2105**] (increasing RVH, new RAD), his elevated PA pressures without florid pulmonary edema, and the gradual worsening of his symptoms, which were previously attributed to sinusitis alone.
Echo showed myxomatous mitral valve.
CXR showed no PNA but we treated him for possible aspiration pneumonia because he was at high aspiration risk because he was intubated.
His first night post-op he had significant rise in his pulmonary artery pressures and was hypotensive.
He remained intubated, sedated and on pressors and inotropes for several days.
He developed post-op afib and was started on amiodarone.
He initially was confused with generalized weakness, greater left sided weakness noted.
Pain meds were adjusted and he was seen by the Psych service for his depression and Wellbutrin was increased.
He was febrile consistently in the first few days post-op and sputum culture was positive for PANTOEA SPECIES.
He developed intermittant atrial fibrillation and his lopressor was increased and he was started on amiodarone and coumadin.
He was also note to have folliculitis over his anterior chest.
Pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
