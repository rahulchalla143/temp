She presented to [**Hospital6 33**] [**2192-2-27**] with complaint of abdominal pain, vomiting, and blood-streaked diarrhea.
She denied fevers at that time.
Initial CT scan diagnosed ileitis of the distal ileum, and she was treated with iv levofloxacin/metronidazole, and kept NPO.
Repeat CT showed improvement in inflammation, but she failed po trial, and continues to have nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
She underwent upper and lower endoscopies and small bowel follow through studies that were nondiagnostic, showing only a small patch of cecal inflammation and left diverticulosis.
She developed a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, thought to be due to ongoing diarrhea.
The LLE pain developed while hospitalized at [**Hospital1 34**].
Doppler U/S was negative for DVT there.

Bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left) with associated atelectasis.
Intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation that is likely secondary to cholecystectomy and likely chronic.Mo retained stones are seen.Correlation with LFTs is recommended.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
HEAD CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
There are again noted mild periventricular changes of small vessel disease.
There is prominence of ventricles and sulci, consistent with age-related mild involutional change.
Imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) NAUSEA/VOMITING: At OSH, pt had evidence of ileitis on CT scan.
This may have provoked N/V that is persisting due to IBS or another cause.
In addition, a head CT was done to r/o intracranial mass lesion.
2) SVT: Pt went into an SVT, likely afib or aflutter with RVR and required admission to ICU.
She was maintained on lopressor for HR and BP control.
3) CHF: Pt had total body fluid overload with b/l pleural effusions, pericardial effusions.
An echo was done which showed mild LVH with preserved EF.
There was mild LVOT gradient.
4) CHRONIC LEG PAIN: Continued on fentanyl patch.
In the hospital, she was moving air well and had no evidence of asthma exacerbation.
8) ANEMIA: Iron studies consistent with ACD though level of anemia and lack of chronic inflammation made this unusual.
