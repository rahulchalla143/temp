Chest x-ray indicated worsening congestive heart failure.
It was suggested that the patient's thrombocytopenia might be secondary to his valproic acid.
On [**4-10**], the patient was noted to be increasingly lethargic with increasing oxygen requirement and arterial blood gas indicated a pH of 7.27 with PACO2 of 75 and pAO2 of 63.
The patient was, therefore, transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
He was maintained on 100 nonrebreather in the Intensive Care Unit, where he was subsequently subject to bronchoscopy, which indicated diffuse mucous plugging.
The patient was also started on a Lasix drip for additional diuresis and started on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl to broaden coverage of his aspiration pneumonia.
On [**4-14**], the patient underwent a left-sided thoracentesis during which 1800 cc of serosanguinous fluid was removed.
