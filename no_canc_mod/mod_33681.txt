Some persistent atelectatic changes or effusion at the left base.
Stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
[**2150-8-5**] Right lower lobe collapse is new.
Left upper lobe collapse has resolved.
Moderate left basal atelectasis present but improved.
Partial opacification of the entire tracheobronchial tree suggests considerable retention of secretions.
[**2150-8-4**] Left lung is almost entirely collapsed, reflected in a uniform opacification and ipsilateral mediastinal shift.
Heterogeneous opacification in the right upper lung could represent incipient collapse or pneumonia.
On [**2150-8-4**] a flexible bronchoscopy showed granulation tissue that was completely occluding the lumen of the trachea.
He was immediately taken to the operating room for Rigid and Flexible bronchoscopy; Tracheostomy tube change from [**Location (un) 17122**] #7 to [**Last Name (un) 295**] #8 adjustable placed at 12 cm.
Repeat flexible bronchoscopy revealed granulation tissue in the subglottic region, vocal cord edema, and supraglottic edema.
Attempted to wean from ventilator patient became tachypnic, saturation 90-92% .50% FiO2 but the patient complained of shortness of breath (high anxiety) on T-tube.
