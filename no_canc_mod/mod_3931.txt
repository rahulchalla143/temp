Admission Date:  [**2105-10-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-10-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-3-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Accupril / Ceftriaxone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: RUQ abd pain, fever, nausea, vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 69 y/o M s/p spinal fusion surgery on [**9-1**], followed by hospitalization for sepsis/cholecystitis managed with percutaneous cholecystostomy, now presenting from [**Hospital 38**] Rehab with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
The abdominal pain is predominantly over his RUQ, at the site of his cholecystostomy tube.
He also has lingering mild left sided pain that has been present since his surgery.
Finally, he has had thigh pain and weakness while at the rehab facility.
There, he had blood cultures drawn, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] out of concern for bacteremia.
Microbiology data from rehab (see below) featured wound culture with VRE and klebsiella, and UCx with yeast, presumptive c. albicans.
During prior admission, patient was found to have cholecystitis on HIDA scan, polymicrobial bacteremia with e. coli and abiothropha, as well as enterococcus in abdominal wall wound culture.
The patient had an ED visit on [**10-13**] for left-sided colicky abdominal pain, for which CT ruled out nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis.
He was started on amox-clav for u/a with 6-10 WBC and few bacteria, with no culture.
CXR, CT chest/abd/pelvis, and abd u/s were unrevealing for source of infection.
The patient was seen by the surgical service, who felt no urgent surgical interventions were necessary at this time, but recommended that ortho spine be consulted for question of possible fluid collection in post-surgical site.
He had also had atrial fibrillation with RVR to 150s early in ED course, which resolved with the IV fluids.

# Abdominal pain/nausea/vomiting: The etiology for these symptoms has not been conclusively established.
An abdominal ultrasound revealed an uncompressed gallbladder and non-dilated billiary tree without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
A CT abdomen/pelvis revealed only a small fluid collection at the site of his lumbar spine surgery that was thought unlikely to be the source of his infection by ortho-spine.
The most likely source of his symptoms is the percutaneous cholecystostomy; a cholecystectomy in the near future is being arranged by the [**Hospital1 18**] surgery department and is planned for 7 to 14 days after discharge once symptoms have resolved.
# Bacteremia: Mr. [**Known lastname 21369**] blood culture from [**Hospital 38**] Rehab grew E. coli in [**1-3**] cultures.
Linezolid was also started in the acute setting because of a report indicating that Mr. [**Known lastname **] had grown VRE from a wound culture.
At the time, it was unknown where the wound culture was taken from, but it was subsequently found that it was from a sacral ulcer not present on this admission.
Fevers resolved and he remained hemodynamically stable without need for pressors.
His linezolid was discontinued because the source of the VRE culture was established as a superficial wound and was unlikely to be the source of his current bacteremia.
His WBC count normalized and he remained afebrile throughout the rest of his hospitalization.
He was discharged on Levofloxacin/Flagyl for a planned course of 14 days or until his follow-up appointment with surgery; ceftriaxone was discontinued because of concern for an allergic reaction to this medication.
# Hypotension: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had one episode of hypotension to 90/54 while in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
This was initially thought to be concerning for sepsis, but it resolved with IV fluids and he experienced no further hypotensive episodes while in the hospital.
This episode was temporally coincident with an episode of AF RVR by history, which may have been the etiology.
# Diabetes: Mr. [**Known lastname 21369**] blood sugars were elevated on [**10-29**], most likely because an evening Lantus dose was skipped on [**10-28**].
His glucose showed a trend toward normalization prior to discharge.
# Eosinophiilia: Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed an absolute eosinophil count of 600 on [**10-29**] that increased to 800 on [**10-30**].
This is thought to be an allergic reaction to cephalosporin antibiotics, which is what prompted the transition to Cipro prior to discharge.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Mr. [**Known lastname 21369**] INR dropped to 1.5 on [**10-30**].

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: E. coli bacteremia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, you got a CT abdomen and pelvis, which revealed a small fluid collection at the site of your lumbar spine surgery.
The orthopedic surgeons felt that this was not the source of your infection.
You also had an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed a decompressed gall bladder and no signs of acute cholecystitis.
There, you remained afebrile and continued to improve clinically with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.
At this point, the most likely source of your infection is thought to be your gall bladder.
