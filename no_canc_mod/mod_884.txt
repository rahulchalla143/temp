Trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layering posteriorly.
Otherwise, no intracranial hemorrhage.
Facial fractures, better assessed on the concurrently performed facial bone CT scan.
Right maxillary sinus wall fractures as detailed, lateral orbital wall fracture, orbital floor fracture without evidence of entrapment or orbital hematoma.
Moderate-sized left pneumothorax without evidence of tension.
Multiple rib fractures on the left, left-sided transverse process fractures in the lumbar spine, left humeral shaft fracture.
NG tube decompression is recommended if there is clinical concern for impending aspiration.
[**2189-11-15**] Left humerus : There is a comminuted fracture along the distal shaft of the left humerus with posterior angulation of the distal fracture fragment and a large adjacent butterfly fragment positioned posteriorly.
Associated soft tissue swelling is noted.
There is an acute fracture involving the base of the first metacarpal.
Multiple lucent fracture lines are seen involving the proximal phalanx of the thumb.
There appears to be a fracture involving the proximal shaft of the proximal phalanx of the fourth finger.
[**2189-11-16**] Left knee : Single frontal view of the left knee demonstrates a mildly comminuted fracture of the proximal shaft of the fibula at the neck.
The fracture appears to extend into the head of the fibula as well.
No fracture is identified within the proximal tibia or within the femur.
[**2189-11-16**] Chest Xray : As compared to the previous radiograph, a minimal millimetric pneumothorax is now visible at the very apex of the left hemithorax.
No evidence of tension.
Unchanged position of the left-sided chest tube.
[**2189-11-16**] Head CT : Small amount of hemorrhage layering in the occipital horns is again noted, minimally increased in the right side, but with no associated hydrocephalus or transependymal CSF flow.
There is no midline shift or mass effect.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 3035**] was evaluated in the Emergency Room, scanned and found to have the following injuries including a very small intraventricular hemorrhage in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] along with multiple fractures in the face, ribs, left arm, left hand, left leg and a pneumothorax in the left chest.
A Chest tube was placed with near complete resolution of the pneumothorax and her respiratory status was stable.
Her pain was controlled and she was able to use her incentive spirometer without much discomfort.
She had a full opthomology exam and her globe was intact and there was no entrapment.
The Ortho-trauma service followed her daily for her left distal humeral fracture, left hand fractures and left fibular fracture.
The Plastic surgery service will tentatively fix her orbital fracture next week if she continues to make good progress  She was seen by the Physical therapy service for a full evaluation and was making progress ambulating on a daily basis.
