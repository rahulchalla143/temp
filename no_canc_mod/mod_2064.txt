male with previous episode of CP and ETT consistent with an inferiour septal fixed defect, hyperlipidemia and GERD presented to [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2103-11-24**] c/o chest pain - intense, retro-sternal, radiating into the back.
Pt also had a similar episode of lesser severity in the evening prior to admission when he took Protonix + Tums with some relief.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt received nitro x2, ASA and Lopressor 5mg iv with very mild relief.
After an hour or so, his CP subsided and pt remained pain-free since then.
ECG in ED showed 1mm ST depression in lateral leads.

ECG ([**2103-11-24**]): Reg sinus rhythm 80, normal axis, normal PR and QT intervals, narrow QRS, mild (<1mm) ST depressions in II, III, avF, V3, V4 .
Ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Mild MR. [**Name14 (STitle) 13274**] on [**2095**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended).
He attained 87% of his maximum heart rate and stress was stopped because of fatigue.
EKG showed 1.5 mm ST segment depressions in leads II, III, and AVF.
The stress images demonstrated a mild defect of the inferior wall and septum.
IMP: MILD FIXED INFERIOR AND SEPTAL DEFECTS.
male with previous episode of CP and ETT consistent with an inferiour septal fixed defect, hyperlipidemia and [**Hospital 5550**] transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] with NSTEMI for cath lab.
Cath lab revealed 3-VD, no wall motion abnormalities and EF of 55%.
He has h/o muscle cramps while on statins, hence this will have to be monitored.
[**Name (NI) **] - pt is euvolemic on exam - pt will continue on ACEI and beta-blocker (see above) - echo done to evaluate EF - Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, LV EF>55%.
Rhythm - currently normal - patient remained on tele - no events reported.
Valves - echo done to r/o vavlular disease: only mild AR and mild MR noted, normal LA and RA.
Post-cath anticoagulation - patient was on Heparin and Integrillin infusions post-cath with Integrillin discontinued [**2103-11-29**], >12hrs prior to surgery - patient compained of a small hematoma in rt cubital area that appeared [**11-28**] and looked much improved [**11-29**], resolved [**11-30**] - he also compained of a "small lump" in his rt groin, which looked like a small ecchymosis.
No hematoma palpated, normal rt femoral pulse with no bruit, normal (2+) rt pedal pulses .
GERD, gastritis in the past - given ASA treament (plus Heparin, Integrillin) patient was started on Protonix 40mg daily - pt reported few episodes of sharp LUQ pain - immediately after meals (not always), no radiation, with no other symptoms.
Pain different from his previous episode of substernal pain, hence was unlikely to be cardiac.
Given that echo reported "abnomal flow" in the abdomen, [**Last Name (un) 103**] U/S done to r/o aortic aneurysm - normal aorta with a moderate atheroma, normal mesenteric vessels.
Therefore, this LUQ pain was thought to be of GI origin - gastritis or duodenitis.
remained pain free on heparin and integrilin prior to surgery.
CXR on [**12-2**] showed no pulm.
edema or effusions, and some right atelectasis, left side cleared.
Percocet changed to dilaudid for improved management of incisional pain.
