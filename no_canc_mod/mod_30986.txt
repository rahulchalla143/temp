Hypoxia: This developed in the setting of IV narcotics use; quick development and rapid improvement was most suggestive of aspiration in the context of sedation.
Contributing could have been chronic low ventilatory state in the context of OSA and MG, although MG crisis thought to be unlikely given 5/5 strength otherwise.
Anemia slightly worse then normal but not sufficient to explain tachycardia.
This was felt to be either related to beta-blocker withdrawal or narcotic withdrawal.
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 2902**]: There was no evidence for current flare.
This was felt to be secondary to B12 deficiency with the possible contribution of Cellcept.
Given that the patient has no reason for nutritional deficiency, pernicious anemia was entertained and IF antibody was sent (pending at d/c).
Headache: Thought to be secondary to possible migraine headache versus med withdrawal headache.
Spinal compression fractures: Narcotics were initially held, but restarted many of the patient's symptoms were felt to be secondary to withdrawal.
