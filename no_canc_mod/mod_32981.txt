He did not immediately seek medical attention but he subsequently developed odynophagia, throat pain and voice change.
He was seen at OSH where a CT scan of the neck demonstrated a right-sided comminuted thyroid lamina fracture with associated laryngeal hematoma.

The pulmonary asculature is normal, allowing for low lung volumes.
CT Neck [**2187-1-30**]: Status post placement of lateral plate and screws over the anterior and posterior fracture of the right thyroid cartilage, with no complication including no pneumomediastinum or subcutaneous emphysema.
He was s/p fiberoptic intubation at the OSH for airway protection after he was found to have multiple thyroid cartilage fractures.
