Admission Date:  [**2193-6-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-6-13**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Nitroglycerin / Plavix  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory arrest s/p foreign body obstruction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation, extubation NGT placement  History of Present Illness: 87 year old woman with PMHx of coronary artery disease (s/p BMS to RCA in [**2184**]), hypothyroidism, GERD/peptic ulcer disease, chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, recurrent UTIs who was in her usual state of health at her nursing home today, baseline A&O X3, who presents with respiratory arrest after choking on lunch.
The patient subsequently lost consciousness when EMS arrived, O2 sat 90% with spontaneous shallow respirations.
En route, the patient did not regain consciousness but maintained shallow spontaneous respirations and O2 sats >90%; she never lost cardiac circulation.
The patient remained unresponsive but agitated, not following commands, so she was intubated for airway protection w/ etomidate and succinate; the ED resident reports not seeing any food around the vocal cords etc.
Labs were otherwise remarkable for creatinine 1.6, mildly positive UA (trace leuks, 2 WBC, few bacteria, <1 epi).
ROS: Patient awake, mildly agitated but able to be calmed by family.
Denies any pain but endorses discomfort from ETT and strongly wishes to be extubated soon.
Briefly, this is an 87 [**Hospital **] nursing home resident who was admitted to the ICU 1 day ago for respiratory failure after choking on a corned beef [**Location (un) 6002**] and subsequently losing consciousness but who never had cardiopulmonary arrest; her pertinent comorbidities include CAD, first degree AV block, hypothyroid, GERD/PUD, hiatal hernia, recurrent UTIs, CRI.
After successful heimlich in the field, she was maintaining sats of 90%, was bagged, brought to ED, intubated for airway protection, and found to be in metabolic acidosis 7.26/36/175/17 with a lactate 5.7.
ICU Course: * Suctioned out chunks of corned beef * Extubated less than 24h after admission * Repeat UA -> large leuk, wbc 44, many bact, no yeast -> Cipro .
<b>ROS:</b> Notes chronic tension headaches and heartburn, otherwise no CP, palpitations, wheezesm, cough, abdominal pain, leg swelling, rashes.
Past Medical History: * Coronary artery disease (s/p BMS to RCA in [**2184**]) * First degree AV block * Hypertension with labile blood pressures * Hyperlipidemia * Myocardial infarction * Hypothyroidism * Orthostatic hypotension * Osteoporosis * Primary hyperparathyroidism * Vertigo * Anxiety/depression with psychotic variant * GERD/Peptic ulcer disease s/p GIB (?upper) in [**8-/2190**] * Hiatal hernia * Chronic renal disease * Recurrent UTIs * Iron deficiency anemia * Tension headaches * Hard of hearing .
No alcohol or illicits.
Otherwise, no family history of sudden cardiac death, malignancies.

CT head - No acute intracranial pathological process.
Large amount of secretions in entire nasopharynx and imaged portion of the oropharynx.
These findings may be compatible with the reported history of recent Heimlich maneuver.
If acute brain ischemia is a clinical consideration, MRI is more sensitive.
There is moderate cardiac enlargement.
High-positioned diaphragms are consistent with poor inspirational effort or reduced pulmonary compliance in this elderly patient.
There are some basal linear densities consistent with plate atelectasis, but no conclusive evidence for acute pulmonary infiltrates is present.
The lateral view discloses a markedly increased depth diameter of the chest related to an accentuated kyphotic curvature and osteopenic appearance of the skeletal structures with multiple mildly wedge deformed vertebral bodies, but no true acute vertebral body fracture.
Bilaterally, small amounts of pleural effusion have accumulated in the posterior pleural sinuses.
When comparison is made with previous chest examinations dated [**2190**], the heart size has moderately increased and the pulmonary vasculature and the pleural effusions suggest a mild degree of chronic CHF.

Although foreign body aspiration events are not uncommon in the elderly population, patient's course has been complicated by loss of consciousness and inability to follow commands.
Can not rule out mental status changes to precipitate the event although daughter states she has had previous partial choking and food stuck in her esophagus in the past.
No bronch overnight, slight risk of chronic inflammation with residual oily foods if left over in airway, but pt doing well clinically and given age, wouldn't sedate her again for bronch.
# Aspiration Pneumonitis: Transferred to the floor with O2 requirement of 3L above baseline of no O2.
CXR and history pointed to aspiration pneumonitis; PNA was considered but thought unlikely in the absence of clinical sequallae.
Follow-up CXR showed small pleural effusions, no infiltrate.
Treated for a complicated UTI with Cipro and discharged on this antibiotic to complete a total course of 7 days.
# Anemia: Previously diagnosed with iron deficiency although also on Vitamin B12.
# CRI: @ Baseline 1.0 .
# Coronary artery disease: s/p BMS to RCA in [**2184**], GIB in [**2190**].
# Hypothyroidism: - Continued home levothyroxine .
# Anxiety/depression: With psychotic variant, reportedly.
# GERD/Peptic Ulcer Disease: s/p GIB in [**8-/2190**] although unclear source at the time.
The patient also has known hiatal hernia.
# Osteoporosis: - Continued home vitamin D, calcium and multivitamin .
# Seasonal allergies: - Therapeutic exchange from loratadine to fenafexadine in-house; discharged on loratadine.
# Elevated eosinophils: Last CBCd showed elevated eosinophils; this should be rechecked on follow-up with primary care physician.
