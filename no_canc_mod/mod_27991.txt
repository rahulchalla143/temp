ECG: Sinus rhythm Marked left axis deviation Septal ST changes are nonspecific Since previous tracing, limb lead voltage increased, R wave progression differences may be related to axis, lead placement, pulmonary disease Clinical correlation is suggested .
MRI HEAD W/ AND W/O CONTRAST: FINDINGS: There is a single focus of increased signal intensity on FLAIR images near the cranial vertex in the right cerebral hemisphere.
Minimal increased FLAIR signal intensity is seen in the periventricular white matter around both lateral ventricles.
There is no abnormal susceptibility artifact or area of restricted diffusion.
Post-contrast images demonstrate no abnormal enhancement.
There are no structural abnormalities.
There is mucosal thickening with the fluid levels seen in the left maxillary sinus and some apparent thickening of the maxillary sinus walls consistent with chronic sinusitis.
IMPRESSION: No finding to specifically suggest present or past toxoplasmosis.
Chronic left maxillary sinusitis.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No evidence of endocarditis seen.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND DOPPLERS: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
Multiple foci of increased echogenicity are noted throughout the liver.
Six discrete areas and several smaller areas of increased echogenicity likely represent hemangiomas.
There is no evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is a right-sided pleural effusion.
No evidence of ascites is seen.
No evidence of biliary obstruction.
Right pleural effusion.
CT ABD/PELVIS W/ CONTRAST: FINDINGS: Note is made of diffusely increased attenuation of the intraperitoneal fat; however, there is no discrete abscess.
No significant bowel dilatation or obstruction is noted.
Note is made of several small low densities in the left lobe of the liver, measuring up to 1.5 cm.
There is right lobe hepatic hemangioma.
Small retroperitoneal nodes are seen; however, there is no significant lymphadenopathy.
Spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and the visualized portion of large and small intestines are within normal limits.
PELVIS: The visualized portion of large and small intestines are within normal limits.
No evidence of abscess is noted.
In the visualized portion of the lung bases, note is made of consolidation in the right lower lobe and a cavitary lesion in the right middle lobe as well as effusion, as demonstrated on the CTA study performed on the same day.
There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in skeletal structures.
Diffuse increase of the attenuation of the intraperitoneal fat in the abdomen with small amount of ascites anterior to the liver, probably due to anasarca.
No evidence of discrete abscess.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Low-density lesions in the left lobe of the liver.
Somewhat prominent CBD and main pancreatic duct, unchanged compared to the prior study.
Right lower lobe consolidation and a cavitary lesion in the right middle lobe with effusion, as noted on the prior CT study.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
There is no acute major vascular territorial infarction.
The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate near complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus and partial opacification of the left ethmoid sinuses.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Partial opacification of the left ethmoid sinuses.
Although there are no significant sclerotic bony changes to indicate chronic disease, these findings are consistent with either acute or chronic sinusitis.
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are multiple non-pathologically enlarged lymph nodes within the mediastinum.
There is no hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.
There is dense consolidation present within the medial aspect of the right lower lobe consistent with airspace disease.
There are patchy areas of ground- glass opacity within the medial aspect of the left lower lobe.
Findings are concerning for multifocal pneumonia among other entities.
CTA CHEST: There are no evidence of filling defects within the pulmonary arterial vasculature.
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
The limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate no gross abnormalities.
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
Multifocal opacities with greatest area of consolidation within the right lower lobe.
There is a peripheral cavitary lesion within the right middle lobe.
Given the chronicity, chronic airspace disease should be considered such as atypical mycobacterium (e.g.
MAC) or chronic aspiration.
Neoplasm, particularly bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma may present as chronic air space disease, but is unlikely given multifocality.
Also given the area of cavitation and multifocal nature of distribution, another possible etiology includes septic emboli.
No pulmonary embolism.
Brief Hospital Course: # Strep pneumo pneumonia with complicating strep pneumo bacteremia: Patient remained stable on room air throughout his admission.
Chest CT remarkable for multifocal infiltrate.
Sputum culture also negative for legionella.
Four out of 4 blood cultures grew out strep pneumonia sensitive to levofloxacin.
TTE was negative for endocarditis.
Given cultures cleared quickly and no peripheral stigmata, ID agreed with deferring TEE.
# Right cavitary lung lesion: Suspect this is secondary to underlying pneumonia, but cannot rule out malignancy.
Ophthomalogy evaluation showed no evidence of ophthmalmitis.
# Chronic Headache: Patient complained of on/off headache while in house.
History of toxoplasmosis but head MRI shows no evidence of past or present toxo.
Imaging remarkable for chronic left maxillary sinusitis.
# Lower extremity swelling: Patient developed 2 + pitting edema in his lower extremities (right>left).
Lower extremity dopplers showed no evidence of DVT.
Patient's edema resolved with diuresis with qd lasix.
This medication can be restarted as needed for recurrence with careful monitoring of his creatinine.
# RUQ/side pain: Patient complains of right sided pain since admission.
He was found to have a dense pneumonia with cavitation, which is likely the source of his pain.
LFTs mildly elevated from chronic hepatitis but are stable.
Patient was started on bactrim DS qd for toxo and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
He was also started on azithromycin for MAC prophylaxis.
He exhibited strong motivation to seek treatment for his problem.
# Depression: No suicidal ideation.
No evidence of stones on CT.  Will need outpatient follow-up and referral to urology if this persists.
Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease but need to be repeated when patient is not actively infected.
# Chronic hepatitis C and history of hepatitis B: Patient's LFTs remained stable except for an isolated elevated alk phos which improved with lasix.
RUQ U/S with multiple hemangiomas.
