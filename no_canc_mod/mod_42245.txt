Admission Date: [**2107-6-17**]        Discharge Date: [**2107-6-26**]   Service:  CME   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was admitted with a chief complaint of hypotension and bradycardia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, polymyalgia rheumatica, and osteoporosis who presents with fatigue and nausea after taking an accidental extra dose of 240 mg of sustain release verapamil and his first ever dose of atenolol (12.5 mg).
He took atenolol and began to feel fatigued and nauseated with substernal chest pain.
The patient also has been complaining of increased palpations and vision dimming lately which precipitated the addition of atenolol in the setting of the patient's history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
The patient denies any recent fevers, chills, sweats, shortness of breath, or dyspnea on exertion.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to have severe sinus bradycardia versus sinus arrest and junctional escape.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
He had pessary muscle contractions consistent with transcutaneous pacing.
He had a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
The abdomen was soft and distended.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed a likely high junctional escape rhythm at 40 with sinus node activity.
QRS of 118, and no ST-T wave changes.
A chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and endotracheal tube in good position.
Of note,  the patient had a recent echocardiogram in [**2106-10-4**] which showed an ejection fraction of 55 percent to 60 percent and symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, a severe resting outflow tract obstruction of the left ventricle, as well as 3 plus mitral regurgitation, 1 plus tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
The findings were consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
HYPERTENSION AND BRADYCARDIA ISSUES:  It was felt by the    Coronary Care Unit team that the most likely explanation    of his hypertension and bradycardia was from the extra    dose of verapamil he took on the day of admission.
The    patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit intubated    with a temporary pacing wire.
The patient was initially    started on dopamine and then transitioned to phenylephrine    for blood pressure support.
He was also initially given stress-dose steroids as there was concern that he may have possible adrenal insufficiency given he is on chronic steroids.
The patient also had a subsequent echocardiogram done while in house which showed severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, an ejection fraction of 60 percent, and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
Additionally, there was mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation seen.
The Coronary Care Unit team felt that it was extremely important he be on nodal blocking agents in the future, as this is the treatment for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
and was then switched from metoprolol to labetalol for further blood pressure control; however, the patient stated that he felt extremely dizzy, and the team attributed this to his beta blocker dose.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and did not have any evidence of hematoma around the pacemaker pocket.
The patient was continued on an insulin sliding scale for his type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
Calcium channel overdose with resultant intubation and    large volume resuscitation.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Polymyalgia rheumatica.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS-FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed to contact his primary care physician should he develop any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or lightheadedness, as well as any other serious complaints.
