Per her family's report since her bilateral knee replacements her gait has been unsteady, due to bilateral knee stiffness.
This morning while walking to the bathroom she fell on both of her knees and then was unable to get up.
She denies any prodrome, but does not remember tripping and falling.
After falling, she denies any CP, SOB, n/v/d, dizziness or lightheadedness.
On initial exam she was found to have an effusion over her left knee, with inability to flex her knee greater than 10 degrees, no evidence of other trauma over the area, no ecchymoses or abrasions.
X-rays were done that showed periprosthetic left femur fracture, she was seen by orthopedics who would like to take her to the OR for repair, but wanted [**Hospital 34306**] medical evaluation prior to going to the OR.
While in the ER her systolic blood pressure dropped into the 60's to 80's around the time of morphine administration, and her labs showed an 8 point HCT drop.
For pain she was given 1000mg of tylenol, 600mg of ibuprofen and 2mg of morphine.
She was given 2L NS, with plans to also receive two units of PRBC's, she was guaiac negative, also with a negative FAST exam, so likely cause of HCT drop is bleeding from her femur fracture.
VS on transfer were: 98.7, 60, 95/60, normal RR, 100% on 2LNC, she was placed on oxygen although she never had any episodes of desaturation.
Also, she previously had some numbness and tingling in her toes on her left foot that is now getting better but she is still having trouble bending her left knee.
