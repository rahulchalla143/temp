Admission Date:  [**2135-12-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2135-12-31**]  Date of Birth:   [**2078-1-25**]       Sex:  F   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51-year-old woman with a history of a recent stroke, asthma, insulin-dependent diabetes, and renal disease who was at Stone Hinge Convalescent Center and noted to have changes in her behavior  On the day of admission at 2:25 p.m. she had an episode of unresponsiveness and then she developed status epilepticus at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.
Congestive heart failure, stroke, lupus, asthma, insulin-dependent diabetes, renal disease.
Cardiovascular revealed tachycardia with a 2/6 systolic murmur.
Chest revealed bilateral crackles, low breath sounds (left compared to right).
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurologically, intubated and sedated, positive tongue abrasion.
Left side had decreased abduction with dolls.
No obvious facial asymmetry which was difficult to tell with a tube in place.
Positive withdrawal to pain on the left lower extremity.
Positive extension to pain in the left upper extremity.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had basic laboratories with a white blood cell count of 15.8, a hematocrit of 32.2.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Head CT done at the time showed only chronic microvascular changes.
No axillar hemorrhage.
Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe opacity, a question of atelectasis.
Slight increased tone on the right side.
Acute coronary artery syndrome was r/o with serial EKGs, creatine kinases and troponin.
Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive encephalomalacia change in atrophy from multiple old infarct.
No acute infarct.
MRA at the same time was read as motion artifact, severely aluminated the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**], visualized internal carotid arteries were likely vertebrobasilar system patent; however, the patient after extubation had new left arm weakness which was not at her baseline.
In addition, she had an electroencephalogram on [**12-20**] which showed very low voltage background with beta in most areas, not epileptiform.
She moved her right arm and had some difficulty moving her left arm.
Because of her diabetes and risk factors for coronary artery disease, she was transfused 2 units with a repeat hematocrit of 34 on [**2135-12-25**].
Her Dilantin was continued, and her mental status improved.
She was started on Levaquin for a possible aspiration pneumonia and then found to have urinary tract infection, and thus the Levaquin was continued.
Her urine grew out Staphylococcus aureus and group B strep.
The sensitivities studies showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and a peripherally inserted central catheter line was placed for a prolonged course of vancomycin.
The patient's neurologic examination improved with her able to have antigravity movement with her left hand.
Her stools were consistent guaiac-positive through the hematocrit drops, and thus we thought that the source was gastrointestinal.
