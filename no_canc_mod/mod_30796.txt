She had emesis at 5 a.m. X 3, with 3rd one with 1 tsp bright red [**Year (4 digits) **] and some epigastric discomfort.
CT chest and CXR revealed large new R effusion vs RLL collapse.
Felt that [**Hospital1 **] was more likely due to hemoptysis rather than hematemesis.
Had hypoxia, new oxygen requirement.
On morning of transfer to MICU, patient had posttussive hemoptysis, with O2 requirement decreasing from 5L to 3L.
Given RLL collapse/R effusion, there was concern for endobronchial mass not seen on CT, causing hypoxia and hemoptysis.

No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 65 y/o F hx end-stage renal disease s/p cadaveric renal transplant in [**2160**], HTN, PVD, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation p/w new oxygen requirement and SOB, edema and hemoptysis.
# Hemetemesis/hemoptysis: Based upon stable HCT and history of vomiting, dry heaves and small amount of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear was the leading diagnosis.
Hemoptysis was likely secondary to heavy coughing in the setting of high INR on admission and RSV bronchitis.
# Hypoxia/RLL collapse/R effusion: Pt was admitted with a new oxygen requirement (5L NC) and new R lower lung collapse with elevated right hemidiaphragm.
O2 requirements were decreased to 3L NC although repeat CXR only showed minimal improvement.
Sputum culture initially showed 1+ gram positive cocci in pairs.
The pt received a bronchoscopy to evaluate hemoptysis which showed diffuse inflammation consistent with RSV bronchitis (positive viral culture) with no obstruction of bronchi and no masses.
Hypoxia was also in part to pulmonary edema likely secondary to diastolic chronic heart failure.
# Acute on chronic renal failure - appeared to be pre-renal in nature (FEUrea 24.5%), with Cr 3.5 on admission.
# Gout - developed gout flare on R index finger DIP and R ankle joint.
# Elevated troponin: Pt with increased troponin which peaked at 0.74 but remained with flat MB.
ECHO did not show any evidence of acute wall motion abnormalities related to ACS and Cardiology felt that the troponin leak was most likely related to demand ischemia.
Coumadin was held on initial presentation [**12-29**] starting antibiotics and recent bleeding, restarted after she had no more episodes of hemoptysis and UGIB ruled out.
# HTN: Has history of labile HTN that was well-controlled in the unit, continued on imdur and hydralazine.
Discharged without Imdur and hydralazine, to be added back on as an outpatient as necessary.
# Diabetes, insulin dependent: Well controlled on home dose of levemir and SSI.
# Hypothyroid: Continued levothyroxine.
# Anemia - was found to be Fe deficient on labs.
# Petechial rash - continued to have petechial rash bilaterally on feet.
Evaluated by Dermatology who felt it was secondary to increased edema and hydrostatic pressure on capillaries.
Recommended leg elevation and compression stockings.
Vasculitis w/u including ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-gbm were all negative.
Disp:*10 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: RSV bronchitis Diastolic chronic heart failure Acute on chronic renal failure Gout Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation and treatment of shortness of breath, need for oxygen, and [**Hospital3 **] in your sputum, as well as [**Hospital3 **] after vomiting.
Part of your lung was collapsed on xray and you had fluid in your lungs, likely due to your heart failure and renal failure.
You were also dehydrated causing acute kidney failure with a creatinine level higher than your baseline.
The bronchoscopy showed only inflammation of your airways consistent with a viral (RSV) bronchitis.
You were also given antibiotics to treat an underlying bacterial lung infection.
After your kidney failure resolved, your Lasix was restarted to get some water out of your lungs, which also helped to improve your breathing.
To keep improving your breathing, you should continue to take your Lasix daily, as well as try to be out of bed, walking as much as possible with assistance, physical therapy, and using your incentive spirometer to open up the collapsed part of your lung.
While you were in the hospital, you had a flare of gout on your finger and ankle, likely due to the fact that we were taking a lot of fluid out of your body with Lasix, and because some of the medications you have to take for your renal failure put you at risk for it.
Your hematocrit remained stable for the rest of your hospital stay and you did not have any more episodes of bleeding.
The initial bleed that you had after vomiting was most likely caused by a small tear in your esophagus caused by the force of vomiting.
In addition, you had low iron levels.
Should you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, decreased urine output, or more episodes of bleeding (in your sputum, in your stools, or with vomiting), call your primary care physician or call 911 for emergencies.
