Admission Date:  [**2166-9-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-9-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-12-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ivp Dye, Iodine Containing / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: weakness, rash (?bactrim allergy), acute respiratory failure.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: HPI: 67yo M with CAD s/p CABG, DM, PVD, [**Hospital 16627**] transferred from OSH with ARDS.
He initially presented to OSH w/ 3 days history of increasing weakness and unable to situp and ambulate w/ his walker.
He had some dizziness and some neck pain but no photophobia.
He also had bitemporal headache an anorexia.
H ealso had a couple episode of vomiting but no diarrhea.
He also had a non-productive cough.
He noted a fascicular and papular rash on his bilateral hands, including his palms and trunk and extremities.
Of note, he has chronic yeast infection in his groin.
IN the ED, he was hypotensive to the 80s w/ HR 62 but afebrile (on b-blocker).
He took a few days of bactrim but developed severe diarrhea as a result of It.
He was advised by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to resume bactrim b/c of concern of persistent infection.
Upon resuming bactrim, he developed a generalized rash started initially over his face and spreading to his abd, his upper and lower ext.
The rash was not painful and no itchy.
Brief OSH course [**Date range (1) 16628**]: He was admitted on [**8-29**] w/ profound weakness and worsening renal fx w/ BUN 78 creat 2.5.
EKG initially RBBB w/ non specific ST T wave changes w/ NSR at 62.
CXR showed some bilateral patchy infiltrate.
He had an extensive exfoliate rash on his upper and lower ext.
One of the exfoliateive lesion was unroofed and sent for culture.
Derm [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 16629**] [**Last Name (un) **] and di not believed that it was virla or herpetic and recommended stopping acyclovir.
He was noted to be in increasing respiratory distress 1-2 days and was given additional dosage of lasix.
Renal was also consulted and felt that the rash is likely from bactrim and sulfa related allergy.
Despite attempted diuresis, he developed bilateral infiltrate (diffuse) and increasing hypoxic respiratory failure.
Of note pt was recently admitted to the vascular [**Doctor First Name **] service for L>R ulcer and was planned to have f/u surgery pending cardiac evaluation.
CAD- s/p CABG x 3 in [**2158**] at [**Hospital1 112**], last cath [**6-28**] with 80% stenosis in SVG to OM1 s/p stent placement 2.
CKD- by report, baseline Cr 1.2, h/o ARF with IV contrast 4.
Hypertension 7.
Hypercholesterolemia 8.
Peripheral neuropathy 9. bilateral carotid stenosis, s/p R CEA [**2161**] 10.
OSA- on home BiPAP 11. history of junctional tachycardia  Social History: He is married.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM on ADMISSION: Vitals- p 109 BP 106/44 O2 90% RR 14 AC TV 450 FI O2 100% RR 14 PEEP 5 PIP 34 General-  NAD, intubated, sedated, generalized exfoliate dermatitis HEENT- PERRL, OP clear w/ dry MMM Neck- Supple, flat JVD Pulm- diffuse crackles and rhonchi CV-  RRR, S1 and S2, no m/r/g Abd-  soft, NT, ND +BS Extrem- cool to touch, poor distal pulses Neuro-  sedated  Brief Hospital Course: Pt admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2166-9-3**] hemodynamically stable, but with ARDS for further management.
Pt was extubated on [**9-15**], but did poorly on CPAP with trials of high flow ventilation.
Pt expired on [**9-25**] from hypercarbic respiratory failure.
# respiratory failure: the etiology of pt's ARDS unclear, but is presumably [**12-26**] bactrim allergy which was being used to treat ?foot cellulitis.
Pt did have bandemia at OSH on arrival, but numerous cultures on presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] and at OSH negative including blood, sputum, BAL, urine, and foot wounds (left and right) were negative.
On presentation to OSH pt noted to have rash of B LE and it was thought that he had a bactrim allergy which he was started on for foot ulcers.
After extubation, pt continued to have copious secretions which improved slowly.
He also remained grossly volume overloaded, and was tolerating only gentle diuresis (~500-1000cc fluid removal daily), given his severe aortic stenosis and preload dependence.
Blood and sputum cultures, though initially negative [**Hospital1 18**] (pt previously on vanco/zosyn from OSH for unclear indication, abx d/c'd [**9-14**]), subseqeuntly were positive for MRSA in blood and sputum on [**9-17**].
# sepsis - on [**9-19**] pt was noted to be hypothermic.
source remained unclear, though ddx included [**Name (NI) 16630**] versus aline/LIJ central line.
By [**9-22**], pt was afebrile for 48hrs, and without hypotension.
his UOP, however remained, low, and given his failure to improve from a respiratory standpoint, pt elected to change goals of care to CMO on [**9-24**] and expired on [**9-25**].
# CV: pt with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2158**], last Cath [**6-28**].
Thought to be due to demand ischemia with hypotension.
Pt's plavix was d/c'd as pt is >1.5 yrs s/p cath and has had had guaic pos stools.
On [**9-24**] pt complained of CP, however no new EKG changes were noted, cardiac enzymes unremarkable compared to prior bump, and CP resolved within <5 min.
b) pump-last ECHO showed decreased EF from [**4-29**] w/ 1+ MR and AS, now with EF 30-40% and mod-severe AS-attempting diuresis with diamox and lasix although on this hospitlization, diureses was complicated by pt's preload dependence.
He continued to remain volume overloaded on [**9-22**], and diuresis was also complicated by ?sepsis physiology.
c) rhythmn: had episode of aflutter on admission, digoxin loaded but not continued.
On [**9-20**] pt developed intermittent aflutter with variable block.
Plan was to treat underlying pulmonary process (pna and pulmonary edema) with linezolid, meropenem and diuresis, however on [**9-24**] decision was made to change goals of care to CMO.
# Foot ulcers- vascular sugery was consulted regarding pt's foot ulcer.
The wound did not probe to bone.
One wound was swabbed which did not grow anything, and the wound do not appear to be infected.
B/L foot xrays could not r/o osteomyelitis.
Pt was afebrile without white count initially off abx.
as this is the case, will continue wound care, but will not workup further for osteomyelitis.
Regarding bilateral lower extremity rash, this was largely resolved on [**9-20**].
Do not feel that this represents cellulitis, as it lacks erythema, no wbc, or fever (off abx, or tyelenol).
#ARF- patients creatinine on admission was elevated to approx 2 and had returned to wnl despite continuing to diuresing with lasix to remove fluid exacerbating respiratory failure.
Pt breifly had guaic positive stool upon presentation, though hct stable after 1 U PRBC.
#hypernatremia- pt initially hypernatremic, felt likely [**12-26**] to hypovolemia and free water deficit.
Pt was treated with free water boluses in TF and d5w once OGT was removed, with subsequent resolution on [**9-19**].
# FEN: s/p extubation pt, evaluation of pt's swallow was attempted, however he was requiring long periods of CPAP which made this difficult.
# DISPOSITION - on [**9-24**] decision was made to change goals of care to CMO after discussion with pt, and family.
on [**9-25**] pt expired due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
