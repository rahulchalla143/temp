Admission Date:  [**2197-10-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-11-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Dilantin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**] Chief Complaint: Reason for admission: Hypertensive emergency  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 74557**] is an 83yo male with PMH significant for HTN and recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] s/p mechanical fall which resulted in SAH and subdural hematoma.
He now presents with elevated blood pressures ~200's at rehab facility.
Per records [**Hospital 74558**] rehab, he has had 2 episodes of elevated BPs that have been difficult to control with oral regimen.
Patient denies any vision changes, headaches, or abdominal pain.
Of note, patient recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-11**] s/p mechanical fall which resulted in SDH and subdural hematoma.
Past Medical History: 1)Type 2 DM 2)SAH, subdural hematoma, and R temporal fracture secondary to mechanical fall on [**2197-10-5**], recently discharged on [**2197-10-11**] (no neurosurgery intervention; only placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis) 3)Hypertension 4)BPH  Social History: Prior to fall very active and worked 3d/week designing medical equipment.
No history of tobacco, alcohol, or IVDA.
IMAGING: [**10-15**] CT Head: Overall unchanged appearance of hemorrhagic contusions in bilateral frontal lobes, with subdural, subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage which has been slightly decreased.
Small high density area within the left subdural collection can represent residual hemorrhage versus recurrent hemorrhage since eight days ago.
[**10-18**] CXR: Dual-obscuration of the left diaphragmatic pleural surface may represent either obliteration by consolidation in the adjacent left lower lobe or small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.
Small right pleural effusion is new.
Persistent left lower lobe consolidation.
New right basilar atelectasis.
[**11-2**] CXR: Progressive decrease in opacification at the right base consistent with clearing of the previously noted pneumonia.
[**10-27**] Renal US: Mildly elevated resistive indices and tardus parvus configuration bilaterally, but no evidence of hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis in right or left kidneys .
The aortic root is  moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or  vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
An eccentric jet of mild to moderate ([**2-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen  directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet.
The mitral valve leaflets are  mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
**FINAL REPORT [**2197-11-3**]**     CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2197-11-3**]):       FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Brief Hospital Course: #) HYPERTENSION: -- On the day of admission, the patient found to have elevated SBPs~200's at rehab facility.
No signs or symptoms of end organ ischemia/damage were noted on admission.
Due to his recent head bleeds, he becomes encephalopathic at lower pressures and at pressures > 200. .
-- He has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] MS throughout the hospital course, considered to be multifactorial in etiology  (old brain bleed + hyponatremia + bacteremia + ?
The hyponatremia has resolved, and his bacteremia was treated and cleared.
Antiseizure PPX was discontinued, as, per neurosurgery recs, he was had no seizure activity and is at low risk for future seizures.
It was noted that he had a diffuse macular-papular rash, thought to be [**3-17**] the dilantin.
He was then placed on Keppra antiseizure PPX, but this was eventually discontinued as it was felt the Keppra could be contributing to his delirium and that he no longer needed antiseizure PPX.
-- The source of the bacteremia remained uncertain.
His urine cultures were negative, and while there was a LLL opacity on CXR, his osycgen saturations were in the high 90's and he did not have a cough suggesting a PNA that would lead to MSSSa bacteremia.
TTE was negative for vegetations.
CXR was repeated twice (once on [**10-31**] and once on [**11-2**]), and there was no evidence of worsening or new PNA.
-- Although no source was ever clearly identified, it was reassuring that he was clinically improving in terms of his delirium and his vital signs were stable.
#) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: -- His baseline Cr was 0.8 and had bumped to 2.5 on [**10-25**].
he had multiple risk factors for ARF including prerenal (has been fluid restricted for SIADH tx; ~1 L per day); renal (nafcillin use; lisinopril use); and postrenal (was temporarily off BPH meds in the setting of delirium and had high bladder volumes on PVR).
-- Lisinopril for HTN was discontinued and other medicines were adjusted.
-- US was negative for renal artery stenosis.
-- As Na had normalized, fluid restrictions were lifted and he was volume resuscitated.
Its unclear whether this is related to underlying SAH and subdural hematoma, as in SIADH.
His metformin was initially held because of his variable diet, and he was kept on a sliding scale.
-- NPH was started at 5 units [**Hospital1 **] with SSI for breakthrough hyperglycemia.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hemorrhage ofthe brain after a mechanical fall 2.
Acute renal failure 3.
MSSA bacteria infection of the lung.
He is conversational and coherent, complaining of poor memory but much more interactive than in prior weeks.
Discharge Instructions: Please return to the ED or call your doctor if you develop a fever or have worsening cough.
Pending serum sodium levels remain normal, please encourage PO fluid intake with assistance for aspiration precautions.
(3) It should be expected that Mr. [**Known lastname 74557**] have some waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] of mental status, as his brain is fragile from the bleeds and very susceptible to slight derangements.
