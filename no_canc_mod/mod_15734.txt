At that time, she hit her head against the wall but was subsequently alert and oriented.
Her head subsequently dropped back and her mouth opened and she became unresponsive.
A CT of her c-spine was significant for C4/C5 space widening with ?
She was started on a nitroglycerin gtt at 0100 for BP control.
She was noted to have a surgical right pupil.
She was subsequently transferred to the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for MRI/MRA of her posterior circulation.
Past Medical History: 1) Atrial fibrillation 2) Diastolic CHF, EF 60% 3) Hypertension 4) Diabetes mellitus, Type II x 20 years 5) Stage V chronic kidney disease (Cr 4.1 in [**10-9**]), followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4090**], were planning for tunneled catheter when the patient becomes sicker and requires dialysis 6) Hypothyroidism 7) Secondary hyperparathyroidism  Social History: Resides with daughter at home.
Physical Exam: VS: T 97.7, 176/79, HR 79, RR 15, SpO2 95% Gen: elderly WF, in c-collar, lying on right side in fetal position HEENT: normocephalic, atraumatic CV: regular rate, sinus rhythm on telemetry, nl S1 S2 Resp: CTA, normal respiratory effort Abdomen: soft, +BS, no grimace to deep palpation Extrem: no edema, 2+ pulses Skin: superficial abrasions on upper portion of posterior torso Neuro: unable to perform complete neuro exam due to lack of patient cooperation, eyes squeezed shut bilaterally, unable to assess pupil reactivity; cogwheeling of upper right extremity, hypertonic in upper extremities bilaterally; upgoing toes on right, downgoing on left; does not follow commands; some spontaneous movements in all extremities  Pertinent Results: [**2117-1-29**] 04:20AM URINE  BLOOD-MOD NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-500 GLUCOSE-250 KETONE-TR BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-7.0 LEUK-NEG [**2117-1-29**] 04:20AM   NEUTS-95.9* BANDS-0 LYMPHS-2.4* MONOS-1.1* EOS-0.2 BASOS-0.2 [**2117-1-29**] 04:20AM   WBC-18.0*# RBC-4.11* HGB-12.7 HCT-36.7 MCV-89 MCH-30.8 MCHC-34.5 RDW-14.1 [**2117-1-29**] 04:20AM   ASA-NEG tricyclic-NEG [**2117-1-29**] 04:20AM   TSH-10* [**2117-1-29**] 04:20AM   cTropnT-0.04* [**2117-1-29**] 12:00PM   CK-MB-7 cTropnT-0.06* [**2117-1-29**] 12:00PM   GLUCOSE-198* UREA N-69* CREAT-6.0* SODIUM-132* POTASSIUM-4.8 CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-21* ANION GAP-18  MR of head [**1-29**]: No evidence of an acute infarct.
Possible tiny subacute infarct in the white matter of the left frontal lobe.
MRA of head and neck [**1-29**]: Nonvisualization of the right vertebral artery could be due to thrombosis.
EEG [**1-30**]:  This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of bursts of generalized slowing superimposed upon a slow background.
This is most consistent with a moderate encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology.
No evidence of ongoing seizure activity was seen, and no focal abnormalities were noted.
CT T spine [**1-29**]:Multilevel degenerative changes w/o evidence of acute fracture or dislocation in the T-spine.
50% loss of height centrally.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Altered mental status:  difficult to determine whether pre or post fall.
She was transferred here for the explicit purpose of MRI/MRA to assess posterior circulation, given widened disk space at C4/C5 and question of cervical sprain.
At [**Hospital1 18**], patient's MS changes were initially thought to be post-concussive vs. secondary to uremia as mental status seemed to improve with hemodyalisis.
However, after multiple dialysis sessions and correlated improving creatinine, patient's mental status remained stable.
An MRI on [**2-2**] showed multiple new small emolizations and again a poorly visualized vertebral artery.
- TEE [**2-4**] showed signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with mod MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
- TEE was performed to eval for atrial thrombus as possible source of emboli.
- Carotid U/S showed < 40% stenosis of both carotids.
- EEG showed diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy.
- Serial cardiac enzymes to r/o MI as precipitant for fall were negative.
Neurology continued to follow the patient and believes her mental status changes are likely due to bihemispheric infarcts.
2) S/P fall with widened disk space w/ cervical strain: Orthospine consult recommended keeping patient in a soft collar until seen in clinic as patient unable to tolerate MR of spine.
Coumadin was discontinued secondary to supratherapeutic INR prior to HD line insertion.
3 bags of FFP given to reverse INR prior to temporary catheter placement.
The patient had a decrease in her platelets while on heparin to a nadir of 94 however her plat .
7) Yeast infection: Pt thought to have yeast infection.
Reglan 10 mg PRN nausea 14.
Tylenol PRN knee/back pain   Discharge Medications: 1.
