The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
TTE [**8-14**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Intra-operatively, patient was noted to have PEA arrest following closure of abdomen while dressing was being placed.
Echo showed no evidence of any cardiac dysfunction, except for mild tricuspid regurgitation.
Neuro: [**Name (NI) **], pt was sedated/given pain control while intubated.
She was extubated on post op day #1 and a chronic pain consult was obtained as she was on numerous medications pre op.
CV: As above pt had PEA arrest intra-operatively.
Electrolytes were optimized as appropriate and no further cardiac abnormalities were appreciated until [**2173-8-20**] when she had PAF as high as 200bpm.
She was asymptomatic but did have a low normal potassium and magnesium.
Cardiology recommendation was to follow up as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22971**] for discussion of AICD placement.
She also developed some edema and redness of her left lower leg and a duplex scan was done on [**2173-8-17**] which ruled out DVT.
Her edema decreased with elevation and antibiotics which prmarily were for her abdominal cellulitis.
GI/GU: Patient was admitted with small bowel perforation within ventral hernia.
Foley was removed on POD#3 and she had no difficulty urinating.
Endo: Patient is chronically steroid dependent related to Crohn's disease and was given stress dose steroids [**Date Range **]-operatively.
On POD3, patient was noted to have area of fluctuance in abdominal wall.
Cultures were sent which revealed enterococcus.
She remained afebrile and her cellulitis was receding.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular, diabetic  diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
17. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5-1 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Small bowel perforation secondary to a foreign body.
Rapid atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: * You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain secondary to a bowel perforation from a chicken bone.
* You had some problems at the end of the operation with your heart and actually required chest compressions and medication to stimulate activity.
You had one episode of of a rapid, irregular heart beat which is called atrial fibrillation but that resolved with correction of your electrolytes and starting lopressor to slow your rate.
* Your abdominal wound was opened in a few areas to drain fluid collections and you will need to continue dressing changes at home as it closes from inside out.
If it increases in size or you develop any chills or fevers > 101 please call your doctor or return to the Emergency Room.
Followup Instructions: Call the Acute Care Clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 600**] for a follow up appointment in 1 week for a wound check.
