Admission Date:  [**2103-9-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2103-9-6**]   Service:  GENERAL SURGERY  INDICATIONS:  Ms. .......... is a 48-year-old female with a past medical history significant for polycystic kidney disease with end stage renal disease resulting in cadaveric renal transplants in [**2099**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23**] here at [**Hospital6 1760**].
Post transplant, the patient was noted to have persistent hypercalcemia with a question of possible primary hyperparathyroidism versus tertiary hyperparathyroidism was raised.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Other past medical history is significant for anxiety, multiple depressive episodes, panic attacks.
She has a history of a cerebral aneurysm, history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, endometriosis, Raynaud's disease with a positive [**Doctor First Name **], as well as history of ovarian cyst.
Additionally, she does have polycystic liver disease.
Vicodin prn for her cystic pain related to her liver.
ALLERGIES:  SULFA, PENICILLIN  SOCIAL HISTORY:  Noncontributory  HOSPITAL COURSE:  After informed consent had been obtained in the outpatient clinical setting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], she has agreed to a neck exploration and possible parathyroidectomy, possible total thyroidectomy.
She underwent a total thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy secondary to adherence of the parathyroids to the thyroid with some difficulty in dissecting out the planes.
It was felt that the entire gland needed to be removed due to this anatomic problem that was spotted intraoperatively.
After having undergone a relatively uneventful intraoperative course including serial PTH values of 55, 51 and 27 that were found intraoperatively, she was extubated without difficulty and sent to the Post Anesthesia Recovery Unit.
While in the PACU, she was noted to have some increased neck swelling and ecchymosis and after several hours of observation within the PACU, the determination was made to bring her back semi-electively for evacuation of the hematoma.
At no time did the patient ever experience any kind of stridor or respiratory compromise.
Of note, upon waking up from her initial operation, she did have a fair amount of retching and emesis secondary to recovery from the anesthesia.
Additionally, although she had small accumulation of hematoma on the inferior flap of the incision, it was not until the patient was moved in the PACU area that she began to accumulate more hematoma.
There was approximately a 200 cc estimated blood loss for the second operation at the time of re-exploration.
She was kept intubated secondary to an awake fiberoptic intubation that was carried out by the anesthesia staff here.
They had felt that the patient had some evidence of focal cord edema.
She was given a dose of Decadron intraoperatively and felt that the safest strategy for the patient would be to keep her intubated overnight and extubate her in the late morning the following day on [**2103-9-5**] under direct supervision of the anesthesia staff.
Subjectively, she was without any perioral numbness or paresthesias.
There is no evidence of Trousseau's.
She had no evidence of stridor on exam.
There was mild ecchymosis.
She did have staples intact.
There was no ooze or erythema from the wound.
By postoperative day #2, the patient remained stable, had no evidence of respiratory compromise, no evidence of hematoma reaccumulation.
She remained afebrile and at discharge exam was noted for a temperature of 98.9??????.
Her blood pressure was 142/70 with a pulse of 88 and sinus rhythm.
She was in no acute distress and she was alert and oriented x3.
There was no erythema, no exudate noted.
She had no evidence of ...........  or Trousseau's on exam.
She was instructed to follow up with her nephrologist at the [**Hospital3 2358**] within the next week as well as to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and her endocrinologist within the next one to two weeks for postoperative evaluation and also to monitor calcium and parathormone levels.
Hypoparathyroidism, rule out primary versus tertiary.
Status post total thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy complicated by postoperative neck hematoma requiring re-exploration and evacuation, now stable and resolved.
No evidence of respiratory compromise.
