female with PMH significant for known CAD (cath in [**2165**], severe COPD (FEV1 <1, on home O2), HTN who presented to [**Hospital **] on [**2171-3-26**] with symptoms of cough productive of yellow/greenish sputum, runny nose.
Over the past two months, the patient has also been having progressive SOB (both at rest and with exertion) and associated left sided chest tightness.
No acute EKG changes.
She was treated for COPD exacerbatoin with ceftaz 1gm q8hrs and levaquin 500mg po daily and solumedrol.
CXR showed opacity c/w early infiltrate vs. atelectasis.
No intervention done.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed diffusely calcified two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
The LAD gave off three small-caliber diagonal branches, and had diffuse disease after the third diagonal branch up to 50%.
The LCx had a 90% stenosis at the origin of the second obtuse marginal branch, and a 50% stenosis at the origin of OM3.
The right coronary artery was heavily calcified and had an 80% ostial stenosis and a 50% distal stenosis before the bifurcation of the PDA and the PLB.
Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling pressures, mildly elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (35 mm Hg), normal left sided filling pressures (PCWP mean of 8 mm Hg), and mildly elevated systemic arterial pressure (149/71, mean 103 mm Hg).
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild systemic arterial hypertension, low-normal cardiac index.
Successful Rotational Atherectomy and Stenting of the OM with a Drug Eluting Stent.
Successful Rotational Atherectomy and stenting of the ostial RCA with a Drug Eluting Stent.
ECHO [**2171-3-29**]: A 4x3cm heterogeneous echogenic mass is seen in close proximity/congruent with the the anterior free wall of the right atrium.
There is also no evidence of obstruction to RV inflow.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function(LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
A mild (25mmHg peak) mid-cavitary gradient is identified.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPERSSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Right atrial mass as described above.
Mild mid-left ventricular dynamic gradient.
Chest CTA [**2171-3-29**]: 1) Soft tissue thickening around the right coronary artery, probably in the epicardial space, measuring up to 1 cm on the myocardial side and 2 cm on the pericardial side, which is somewhat hyperdense on the precontrast images.
Given recent cardiac catheterization, appearances are most concering for epicardial hematoma.
If clinically indicated confirmation and further characterization could be performed using cardiac MRI.
2) Well-circumscribed low-density region of the superior most aspect of the IVC, without definite corresponding findings on the precontrast examination.
3) Severe COPD.
4) Multifocal vertebral body compression fractures.
ADDENDUM: Additional literature review shows that epicardial hematoma is a rare entity which can be associated with regional myocardial infarction due to risk of avulsion of RCA perforators.
CXR [**2171-3-29**]: Early congestive heart failure.
No evidence for pneumonia.
Cardiac catheterization [**2171-3-30**]: Selective coronary arteriography revealed no significant coronary artery disease.
US left groin [**2171-3-31**]: No evidence of AV fistula, pseudoaneurysm, or hematoma within the left groin.
Coronary artery disease.
The patient had a known 3 vessel disease by catheterization report in [**2165**].
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2171-3-28**] which revealed tight stenoses in the OM1 and RCA.
The procedure was complicated by a localized small wire perforation of the RV marginal branch that appeared stable without visible hemodynamic sequelae during the procedure.
The patient then had an echo performed which revealed an incidental finding of an abnormality in the anterior free wall of the right atrium.
Repeat cath showed no significant coronary artery disease.
The previously noticed perforation in the RCA was no longer present.
Norvasc was stopped to optimize anti-ischemic regimen.
Beta-blocker was not added because the patient has severe COPD.
Left femoral US was negative for pseudoaneurysm or hematoma.
She patient was transferred from the OSH on Ceftazidime and Levaquin which were started empirically to cover for pneumonia given a question of infiltrate on CXR.
The  had no evidence of decompensated CHF on exam or by cath report.
The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation with slow steroid taper (started [**3-29**] prednisone at 60 mg), Levaquin, and she was continued on her nebulizers and inhalers.
