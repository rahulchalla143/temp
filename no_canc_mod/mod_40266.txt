No pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental level.
Small right and moderate left nonhemorrhagic layering bilateral pleural effusion, increased since [**2201-5-15**].
Complete collapse of the left lower lobe, collapse of basilar segments of the right lower lobe, and dependent opacities in both upper lobes, likely atelectasis.
Signs of mild interstitial edema.
Mild upper lobe predominant emphysema.
Severe coronary artery calcifications.
Minimal aortic valve calcifications, of unknown hemodynamic significance.
No acute intracranial process, including no hemorrhage, edema, or mass.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3631**]-weighted imaging is most sensitive for evaluation of acute infarction.
Right corona radiata hypodensities, most likely representing chronic lacunar infarcts.
Paranasal sinus disease as described above.
Increasing size of loculated fluid collection in the left retroperitoneal space since [**2201-5-15**] without evidence of rim enhancement to suggest abscess.
There is no evidence of active extravasation.
Stable post colostomy bowel without evidence of obstruction.
No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm leak post repair.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = XX %).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= XX %).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No vegetations identified.
[**2201-6-5**] UENI: No evidence of DVT involving the bilateral upper extremities.
Somewhat limited evaluation of the right cephalic vein, which compresses normally.
[**2201-6-5**] LENI: Normal bilateral lower extremity ultrasound examination.
No evidence of DVT.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Known mid to upper pole complex cystic lesion in the left kidney, seen on prior CT, is not well seen and is incompletely evaluated on this study.
Bilateral effusions and atelectasis.
Mild ascites and anasarca.
Given rapid decrease in size of this collection, spontaneous decompression and drainage via the left flank wound is most likely.
Unchanged size of complex left upper pole renal cyst likely hemorrhagic/inflammatory change involving previously identified simple renalcyst.
Unchanged appearance of the stomach, small bowel, and residual ascending and proximal transverse colon, which terminates in a right lower quadrant end colostomy.
Unremarkable appearance of the rectal stump, with no pelvic abscess identified.
Bilateral fat- and fluid-containing inguinal hernias.
[**2201-6-12**] CXR: Increased bilateral pleural effusions and likely relaxation atelectasis.
To evaluate possible pulmonary edema, recommend conventional PAand lateral.
Brief Hospital Course: 79-year-old man with recent aortic aneurysm repair ([**1-/2201**]), complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound dehiscence, also with h/o CAD s/p CABG who is transferred from the medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia.
# Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt was started on vanc and zosyn while inpatient for presumed HAP.
However, he became tachypneic on the floor to the 30s-40s with progressive hypoxia to the 80s, tachycardia, hypotension to the 80s, and delirium.
He was continued empirically on broad antibiotics but given absence of positive bacterial cultures, these were discontinued for treatment of pneumonia on [**2201-6-8**].
His respiratory failure was thought to be primarily to be due to bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis; these were too small to be drained.
Given his very low respiratory drive when he self-extubated on [**2201-6-7**], EMG study was done which was consistent with critical illness neuromyopathy rather than a pre-synaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission.
# Recent AAA repair, colectomy, wound infections: Pt with loculated fluid collection measuring 8x6x11 in left retroperitoneal on CT abdomen on [**6-4**], increased since [**5-15**].
He was noted to have purulent drainage from his incision site on [**2201-6-9**] and restarted on vanc/zosyn.
Wound culture grew out corynebacterium diptheroids.
CT abd/pelvis on [**2201-6-10**] showed decreased size of fluid collection consistent with spontaneous decommpression and drainage via the incision site.
Pt remained afebrile with resolution of initial leukocytosis.
ECG unchanged from prior with no active issues or complaints.
Metoprolol initially held in setting of hypotension but restarted at low-dose.
