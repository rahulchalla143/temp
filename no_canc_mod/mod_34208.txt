Admission Date:  [**2146-11-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-11-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-1-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 67 year old female with a history of Type II DM, HTN, stage III CKD, and 2 vessel CAD admitted on [**2146-11-3**] with hyperglycemia.
The patient was hospitalized two months ago with dysphagia and provided history suggestive of CHF.
Subsequent evaluation showed severely depressed LVEF, 20-25%, with elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures.
The patient was evaluated by CT surgery, and was determined to be a poor surgical candidate.
The patient was discharged with a plan to optimize medical management of presumed ischemic heart disease (there had been a question of possible tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, alcoholic cardiomyopathy).
Iron studies did not show evidence of hemachromatosis.
Since admission, management of hypervolemia from CHF has been limited by hypotension.
Her exercise capacity and level of activity have been limited over the past few months due to progressive DOE.
Patient does have [**1-19**] pillow orthopnea with occasional PND.
Lower leg swelling has not changed over prior two months.
Currently, the patient notes fatigue and mild shortness of breath at rest during the interview.

Linear opacity adjacent to the effusion is most consistent with atelectasis.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no hilar enlargement.
IMPRESSION: Persistent moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion, with atelectasis.
No edema  ECHO: [**2146-11-7**] The left atrium is elongated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle (fibrotic apical trabeculations are seen).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**11-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-9-11**], the right ventricular cavity is slightly larger with more severe free wall hypokinesis.
With administration of home doses of insulin, hyperglycemia corrected.
There was no evidence for an infection.
Hospital course was then complicated by the development of hypotension from decompensated CHF.
Although patient ruled out for an acute ischemic event, echo showed progression of cardiac dysfunction with an EF of 20%, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and severe RV dysfunction with free wall hypokinesis.
CCU course complicated by the development of PEA requiring cardiac resuscitation with intubation and 4 pressor support.
Given the patient's end stage heart failure and prognosis, the family decided to withdraw care.
