Last Thursday, the patient's grand-son called his mother [**Name (NI) 5627**], and stated that his grand-mother's was not talking any sense, and the speech was not coming out fluently, and she was speaking with a limited vocabulary.
The patient was taken to [**Hospital 27217**] Hospital, and her vitals were noted to be unremarkable, but her head CT demonstrated a "large, left cerebral hemisphere convexity, ?
This was out of character for her mother, but since the patient was at her neurological baseline, her daughter did not seek medical help at this time.

This subdural collection measures approximately 2 cm at maximal thickness.
There is about 2 mm of rightward midline shift.
Focal cortical hypodensity in the right occipital lobe can represent encephalomalacia from a prior ischemic insult.
Scattered periventricular and subcortical areas of white matter hypodensity likely represent areas of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Focal hypodensity in the left basal ganglia is compatible with a chronic lacunar infarct.
There is no definite adjacent cerebral edema.
Intracranial vascular calcifications are noted.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinus air cells.
Left-sided multiloculated heterogeneous subdural collection, possibly representing acute on chronic hematoma, but infection cannot be excluded.
There is 2 mm of associated rightward midline shift.
Chronic small vessel ischemic disease, chronic left basal ganglia lacunar infarct, and remote right occipital lobe infarct.
CT [**2143-5-26**]: A left-sided subdural collection, that is predominantly hypodense, though demonstrates a rim of hyperdensity is not significantly changed in size or appearance from prior study, with the largest sections measuring up to 20 mm transversely.
A focal hypodensity within the right occipital lobe may reflect the sequela of prior infarction/ injury and is unchanged.
There is no significant shift of midline structures to right though there is some mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere.
Periventricular white matter low attenuation is most compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent, likely reflective of age- related parenchymal volume loss.
Visualized paranasal sinuses reveal mild mucosal thickening of several ethmoid air cells, with evidence of prior FESS.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 85376**] is an 83 yo right handed woman on coumadin for PEs who initially presented with multiple episodes of sudden onset speech difficulties and was noted to have a right facial droop, and right sided weakness today.
Her head CT demonstrates a stable loculated left acute on chronic subdural collection and a probable old right occipital infarct.
GIven her therapeutic INR new stroke was thought to be unlikely and these episodes were more likely seizure or symptoms from the SDH.
She had a repeat CT scan the following day which showed a stable chronic SDH, with some small area of fresh hemorrhage.
Her lasix was held and can be retstarted if she develops difficulty with lower extremity edema.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Left sub-dural hematoma   Discharge Condition: MS: awake, alert follows commands, mild inattention, unable to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 1841**] backward, short term memory difficulty.
CN: intact, slight RNLF, poor hearing bilaterally, o/w fully intact Motor: mild paratonia o/w full in UE/LE [**Last Name (un) **]: decreased vibration to knees, o/w intact to LT, pinrick Gait: stooped, slight shuffling   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for multiple episodes of speech disturbance, and a right facial droop and right arm weakness.
You were initially brought to an outside hospital where a left chronic subdural hematoma with an acute component was noted.
If you have any worsening of your symptoms please call your doctor or return to the nearest emergency room.
