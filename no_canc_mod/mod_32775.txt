The LMCA had an eccentric 80% lesion distally near the bifurcation.
The LAD had a 90% stenosis both before and after D1.
The RCA was notable for an 80% stenosis in the mid-PDA.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic systolic arterial pressures, with a central aortic pressure of 137/77, mean 93 mmHg.
[**2107-2-4**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA no stenosis.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
