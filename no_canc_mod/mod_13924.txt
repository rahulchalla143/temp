She tolerated extubation for approximately four to five hours and then became stridorous, requiring reintubation.
Her mental status is still somewhat confused but better.
She had a magnetic resonance scan which showed no evidence of stroke.
Neurology attending saw her and neurology thought her confusion was multifactorial due to sleep deprivation.

If there is any redness, drainage or fever which occurs, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] should be notified immediately.
