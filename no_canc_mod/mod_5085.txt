CT ABDOMEN, PELVIS AND THIGHS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [**2108-6-12**] HISTORY: Peripheral vascular disease, status post recent thrombectomy of right fem/peroneal graft, fem/femoral graft and patch angioplasty of left ax/fem graft.
Left groin wound left open to granulate.
Now with fever of unknown margin and acute CHF.
FINDINGS: ABDOMEN: Upper images include the chest and show that there is no lung parenchymal edema or pleural fluid at the bases.
A less than 2 mm nodular density seen at the right lung base peripherally is not seen on prior studies.
Some pleural thickening and atelectasis or scar is seen at the right base posteromedially.
Prominent coronary and mitral annular calcifications are seen.
There is, however, complete opacification of the femoral crossover portion of the graft, and the right-sided anastomosis appears widely pain as does the visualized portion of the right femoral/peroneal graft (distal anastomosis into peroneal not included in view of study).
Dense calcification is seen in the patient's occluded native arteries.
The open left groin wound shows some smooth induration consistent with granulation tissue, but no fluid collection or abnormal enhancement is seen.
An inguinal lymph node just lateral to the open wound on the left measures 9 mm in short- axis dimension.
On the right, a low-density fluid collection is seen anterior to and surrounding the region of the femoral to distal anastomosis.
There is a smaller, 16 x 10 mm ovoid collection, possibly in continuity with this, just superior to this, and a smaller ovoid density just inferomedial to this on the right representing an enhancing right inguinal lymph node.
No findings suggestive of infected groin abscesses are seen on either side.
The right common femoral vein appears non-acutely thrombosed (denser than left common femoral vein pre-contrast and unenhanced post- contrast, but not distended or showing any inflammatory change).
The liver and spleen have an unchanged appearance compared to prior studies, with single small hypodensities unchanged compared to [**2104**].
Large heterogeneous calcified gallstone is seen without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
The inflammatory change in the anterior pararenal space suggestive of acute pancreatitis on the [**Month (only) 958**] study has resolved; however, there is now a focal 9-10 mm hypodensity at the tail of the pancreas, which may be sequela from that inflammation.
This does not have density measurements consistent with fluid, but is also rather small to accurately characterize.
The native aorta shows dense atherosclerotic plaque including origins of the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery which are stenosed.
A large area of wedge- shaped hypodensity in the right kidney laterally appears to have decreased in volume, suggesting this was related to old infection or infarction.
There are calcifications seen on the pre-contrast view of the kidneys, probably vascular.
There is a small amount of fluid around the right kidney superiorly which is new from the [**Month (only) 958**] study.
PELVIS: See above for vascular bypass details.
There is some free low- density intraperitoneal fluid seen, right greater than left, and this was also noted in [**Month (only) 958**], but no regional bowel inflammation is seen.
The urinary bladder is nearly empty at the time of scanning.
Evaluation of bones shows severe diffuse osteopenia, mottled at the level of distal femora and probably at least partially secondary to disuse.
Thoracic spine osteophytes are seen, and facet osteoarthritis is seen in the lower lumbar spine bilaterally.
An anterior intrathecal calcification is seen at the level below the inferior body of L2, possibly arising from the vertebral body.
Incompletely occlusive filling defect consistent with thrombus or heaped neointima at left inguinal level of fem/fem crossover graft.
Right groin fluid collection surrounding femoral portion of graft, most consistent with seroma, with no definite infection seen in either groin region.
Free intraperitoneal fluid, most notable dependently in the right side of the pelvis, not significantly different compared to [**2108-3-15**], but with some new low-density fluid seen at the superior portion of the right kidney.
Severe native atherosclerotic disease with coronary artery calcification and calcified stenoses origins of visceral vessels, as described, with occlusion of native infrarenal aorta.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Severe osteopenia, degenerative changes and disc disease in the lumbar spine, with unchanged spondylolisthesis.

Patient with fever of unknown origin, acute CHF, now septic.
Assess for pneumothorax.
There are multiple sternotomy wires overlying the midline of the chest.
She continued to have low grade temperatures and surveillance blood cultures were sent from both her PICC line and a peripheral site.
She continued to report diarrhea and C.Diff cultures were sent.
With the continued low grade fevers and poitive blood cultures, a CT A/P was performed on HD 5, demonstrating a right groin fluid collection and a thrombus in the fem-fem bypass graft.
A VAC dressing as then applied to the left groin wound infection site.
She complained of some shortness-of-breath and a chext xray was performed demonstrating persistent right pleural effusion and possible small left pleural effusion.
Following return from her PMIBI study, she complained of increasing shortness-of-breath and she was transferred to the CSRU.
In the ICU, her cultures continued to be positive for pseudomonas and she required desensitization to meropenem per infectious disease consult recommendation.
On HD 7, surveillance blood cultures continued to be sent with blood cultures for HD 8 still positive for pseudomonas.
In was decided that she would need to have her infected graft removed.
She underwent an excision of distal portion of left axillobifemoral graft and replacement with interposition left axillary profunda bypass and left axillary to mid cross-femoral bypass with 8-mm PTFE and debridement and closure of left groin wound on [**2108-6-19**].

New pain, numbness or discoloration of your lower or upper extremities (notably on the side of the incision).
Watch for signs and symptoms of infection.
These are: a fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus draining from the incision site.
If you experience any of these or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.
Limit strenuous activity  and or heavy lifting until the wound is well healed.
Activity may prevent the wound from healing.
Try to keep your affected limb elevated when not in use, This decreases swelling to the affected wound and helps in the healing process.
Be sure you take the full course even if the wound looks well healed.
