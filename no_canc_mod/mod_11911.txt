Post operatively he was admitted to the ICU intubated and sedated requiring milrinone and neo for hemodynamic support.
He awoke somewhat anxious and was extubated requiring moderate pulmonary toilet due to extensive pulmonary history and Bipap support.
Post-operative afib was started on amiodarone and coumadin therapy.
