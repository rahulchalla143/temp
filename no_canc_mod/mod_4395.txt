Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 24344**] is a 55 year old female with history of ankle fracture 6 weeks ago, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, who presented with a severe metabolic acidosis, acute pancreatitis, and transaminitis, likely due to alcohol.
She was taking opiods round the clock for her fracture, but started having hallucinations and confusion, along with vomiting and inability to take PO.
Was found to have anion gap metabolic acidosis (Bicarb was 7), without serum or urinary ketones.
Etiology felt likely due to alcohol/starvation acidosis, so was admitted to MICU.
She was treated supportively with IVFs (D51/2NS), and kept NPO given additional finding of Lipase elevated to 1715.
CT abdomen revealed peri-pancreatic stranding consistent with acute pancreatitis, fatty liver, and 1 cm cystic lesion at pancreatic head, ?
She did not have abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: HTN High cholesterol  Social History: Patient lives with her wife, [**Name (NI) **].
Family History: n/a  Physical Exam: VS: T 98.2, HR 110, BP 150/91, 17 RR , 99% on RA Gen: appears comfortable HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, moist mucous membrane CV: tachy, regular, no m/r/g Pulm: Clear to auscultation b/l Abd: +BS, soft, non-tender, non-distended Ext: trace edema Neuro: no tremor.
Nonspecific T wave changes.
Since previous tracing of [**2120-9-29**], sinus tachycardia present.
There is a paucity of bowel gas with only a small amount of gas seen within the rectum and loop of bowel in the left upper quadrant.
Findings may be related to small-bowel obstruction with fluid-filled loops of bowel and clinical correlation is advised.
There is no evidence of free air below the diaphragm.
The osseous structures appear intact with a mild rotatory scoliosis noted.
Degenerative changes are also noted in the visualized portions of the lower thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Paucity of bowel gas, which in the correct clinical setting may be due to underlying bowel obstruction.
No free air.
3) Abd/pelvic CT: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 1131**]-Mild peripancreatic stradning, may reflect changes of acute pancreatitis.
A 1 cm cystic lesion is present in the pancreatic head, with diagnostic considerations including a pancreatic pseudocyst, cystic neoplasm of the pancreas, or an IPMN.
Diffusely fatty liver.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 24344**] is a 55 year old female with HTN, HL, etoh abuse, recent ankle fx on opiods, presented with anion gap metabolic acidosis and pancreatitis.
In the MICU, she was treated supportively with IVFs (D51/2NS), and kept NPO given additional finding of Lipase elevated to 1715.
CT abdomen revealed peri-pancreatic stranding consistent with acute pancreatitis, fatty liver, and 1 cm cystic lesion at pancreatic head, ?
She did not have abdominal pain.
Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Etiology of metabolic acidosis was likely starvation ketosis in the setting of not tolerating POs for > 2 days and chloride losses from vomiting.
History was consistent with opioid withdrawal given 6 weeks of standing oxycodone 10 mg q 4 hours.
Patient continued to remain asymptomatic- no tremors, diaphoresis, irritability, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.
Acute pancreatitis.
Patient had elevated lipase 1715 on admission.
She denied any abdominal pain.
Abdominal CT showed changes consistent with acute pancreatitis, although also concerning for pancreatic head mass, ?
Transaminitis: Patient had nausea, vomiting and highly elevated LFTs at time of admission.
Given significant history of alcohol abuse, alcohol is the most likely etiology of her transaminitis.
No evidence of acute infection.
No signs of bleeding.
Heparin sc was held given increased risk of bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia.
Hyperlipidemia: Tricor was held given elevated LFTs, but told to continue upon discharge when LFTs improved.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: 1) Acute pancreatitis 2) Opiate intoxication 3) Transaminitis- likely due to alcohol 4) Pancytopenia (low blood counts)- most likely due to chronic alcohol consumption  Secondary diagnoses: 1) Hypertension 2) Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with nausea, vomiting and inability to tolerate food.
These symptoms were most likely due to acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and several lab abnormalities.
In addition, you presented with altered mental status which was thought to have been a side effect of overusing opiates (pain medications).
A cat scan of your abdomen showed changes consistent with acute pancreatitis; however, other pathologies cannot be excluded.
Call your doctor if you have any symptoms or concerns.
