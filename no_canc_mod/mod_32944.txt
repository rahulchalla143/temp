Admission Date:  [**2190-2-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-2-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2159-8-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1136**] Chief Complaint: Hypertension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 30 year old female G1P1 with h/o proteinuria which developed during 2nd trimester ?FSGS [**3-2**] obesity and chronic headaches s/p SVD [**1-26**] admitted to OB/Gyn [**2-16**] with initially refractory hypertension SBP 170s-200s.
SBP remained elevated to 190s despite hydral 10IV x 2.
She also complained of headache so team was concerned about hypertensive emergency and need for nitroprusside drip.
In terms of prior agents, she reportedly had headache with nifedipine.
The patient reports history of LE edema in [**2186**] treated with diuretics but no prior history of elevated BP or kidney disease or proteinuria.
During her early second trimester she developed bilateral LE edema.
UA revealed proteinuria and 3480mg proteinuria.
She was referred to Nephrology at [**Location (un) 2274**] for further evaluation where she had a normal renal US but no further workup due to pregnancy.
Given she remained normotensive and was relatively early in her pregnancy, she was presumptively diagnosed as having FSGS due to morbid obesity.
She had SVD on [**2191-1-26**] complicated by hypertension but was normotensive prior to discharge.
On admission, she was initially hypertensive to the 190s systolic with HA but no CP or neurologic deficits.
She also describes that LE edema is unchanged over the last 2 months.
Family History: Mother with HTN and Father with DM2.
[**Name2 (NI) **] family history of kidney disease or issues with pregnancy.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No papilledema or retinal hemorrhage.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
No HSM EXTREMITIES: 1+ edema B/L no calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
MRI/MRV Head [**2190-2-20**]:  No acute infarction.
A few subcortical hyperintensities which may be seen in the setting of migraine headaches or hypertension related small vessel ischemic changes.
Brief Hospital Course: 30 year old female G1P1 approximately 4 weeks post partum admitted for hypertension and nephrotic syndrome.
During her pregnancy she was found to have elevations in her blood pressure, and was thought to have pregnancy induced hypertension.
PIH still remained in the differential, however other etiologies including essential hypertension (many of her family members suffer from hypertension) and hypertension secondary to renal disease were higher on the differential.
During the hospitalization, the patient was transferred from the post partum unit to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypertensive emergency, given she complained of headache while her systolic blood pressure was over 200.
It was found that her right arm is typically 10 to 15mmHg less than her left, without signs of acute dissection.
The most likely diagnosis per her outpatient nephrologist is FSGS secondary to morbid obesity.
Her nephrotic syndrome may be residual pre-eclampsia as well or secondary to long standing essential hypertension.
Headache:  Initially thought to be secondary to elevated blood pressures, however upon further history the patient reports these headaches were present prior to her pregnancy.
MRI/MRV was completed which did not show cause of her headaches.
Most likely they are either chronic tension headaches or atypical migraines given similarity to usual headache and reproducibility on exam.
Elevated ALT, AST:  Elevated on admission, but decreased subsequently, thought to be most likely secondary to hemolyzed lab specimen.
