Markedly shrunken and cirrhotic liver with no focal liver lesions identified.
Massive ascites 3.
Right middle lobe and right lower lobe opacities could be due to atelectasis or aspiration.
Bilateral ground-glass opacities could represent infection or hemorrhage.
Right middle lobe and right upper lobe consolidations with element of atelectasis might be due to aspiration.
The right middle lobe and right lower lobe atelectasis could be also secondary to high position of the hemidiaphragm.
Severe ascites with cirrhotic appearance of the liver.
Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
Left renal cortical cyst.
Bronchitis/PNA: Repeat CXR with evidence of RLL and RML infiltrate.
Patient initially admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10, howver he was transferred to the MICU on HD 3 due to episode of ongoing SVT with HR to the 170's.
EP evaluated and felt this was an atrial tachycardia and he was started on amiodarone drip.
Also, on [**1-10**], his tunnelled dialysis catheter was replaced as the current line was felt to be too far into the atrium, potentially causing atrial irritation.

Patient also had 5 episodes of bilious, non-bloody emesis.
