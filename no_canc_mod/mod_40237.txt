Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
The cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged, with left ventricular prominence.
The aortic silhouette is extremely dilated up to 5.5 mm, concerning for aneurysm or dissection.
Both lungs are grossly clear, without consolidations or effusions.
The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures reveal degenerative changes along the thoracic spine, with mild anterior wedging of some upper/mid thoracic vertebral bodies.
IMPRESSION: Severe dilatation of the intrathoracic aorta, concerning for aneurysm or dissection.

CT OF THE CHEST PRE- AND POST-IV CONTRAST: There are no pleural effusions.
Several small shoddy lymph nodes are seen within the mediastinum and both axilla.
No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified.
There is also a small ill-defined nodule measuring approximately 7 mm in the right upper lobe anteriorly.
There is no area of focal consolidation.
The heart is slightly enlarged.
Coronary calcifications are evident within the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN POST-IV CONTRAST: 2 small hypodensities are seen within the inferior most margin of the right lobe of the liver, which are too small to characterize, but likely represent cysts.
A few small nonpathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen scattered throughout the abdomen.
There is no free air or free fluid.
There is no free fluid.
CT ANGIOGRAM: There is evidence of prior aortic surgery with clips and what appears to be an anastomosis just superior to the native aortic valve.
No aortic graft is identified.
Calcification is seen throughout the intrathoracic aorta.
There is a dissection flap seen within the aorta, which begins in the ascending aorta and continues into the abdominal aorta, terminating just below the level of the renal arteries.
Contrast enhancement is seen within the celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries.
The celiac artery is stenotic, and there is post stenotic dilation.
There are 3 right-sided renal arteries and 2 left-sided renal arteries, all of which originate from the true lumen and demonstrate contrast enhancement.
Calcification is seen throughout the intraabdominal aorta and the iliac arteries.
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
In addition, severe degenerative changes are seen within the left shoulder joint.
Multiplanar reformatted images confirm the above findings.
No aortic graft is identified, and there is an extensive aortic dissection beginning in the ascending aorta and extending into the infrarenal abdominal aorta.
Dilation of the left sinus of Valsalva.
Stenosis at the origin of the celiac artery with post-stenotic dilation.
Bilateral iliac artery aneurysms, left greater than right.
Right upper lobe ill-defined nodular density.
