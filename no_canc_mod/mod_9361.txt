Admission Date:  [**2200-2-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2200-2-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2143-12-24**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left upper extremity numbness and weakness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented to [**Hospital3 3834**] [**Hospital3 **] with acute onset of numbness and weakness on the left upper extremity.
He initially noted paresthesias in the left lateral shoulder while working on his computer on the evening of admission.
Within 5-10 minutes of onset, his entire left upper extremity became numb and paralyzed.
He immediately went to [**Hospital3 3834**], where his left upper extremity was noted to be cold, pale, and pulseless from the axilla distally.
He was sent to [**Hospital1 346**] for insufficiency and Vascular Surgery consult.
On arrival to the Emergency Department, he subjectively noted improvement in his symptoms, but persistent absent radial pulse in the left upper extremity and no pulse in the dorsalis pedis, posterior tibialis in the right lower extremity.
His blood pressure was 183/141, and therefore he was taken for a CTA to rule out aortic dissection.
He was found to have very large bilateral pulmonary embolism, splenic infarct, chronic infrarenal aortic and right common iliac dissections.
He denied any trauma to the arm or shoulder.
He had a 10 day history of dyspnea on exertion complaining of shortness of breath with two flights of stairs.
He denies any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.
There is no other weakness or numbness elsewhere on his body.
He denies any bright red blood per rectum, melena, or bleeding gums.
Again, he denies any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss.
Hernia repair as a child.
No history of coronary disease or coagulopathies.
FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:  Mother died of brain cancer at age [**Age over 90 **].
Father with arrhythmia and died with a complication of a hernia repair, no bleeding disorders.
Generally, this is a pleasant male in no acute distress who is resting comfortably in bed.
The neck is supple and without carotid bruits.
Normal S1, S2, no murmurs or gallops noted.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
No hepatosplenomegaly felt.
There is no radial pulse in the left upper extremity.
There is presence of an ulnar pulse in the left upper extremity.
There is also a presence of a dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
Right upper extremity is [**6-2**].
Decreased sensation in the left hand and forearm which have been improving.
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrate or effusion.
CT scan showed bilateral large pulmonary embolism, splenic infarct, and chronic infrarenal, aortic, or right common iliac dissection.
There is a right heart strain pattern in V2 through V4 with T-wave inversion in III.
Given that the patient had bilateral pulmonary embolism discovered on CTA, patient was put on Heparin for a PTT of 60-80.
Doppler of the lower extremities showed a right popliteal deep venous thrombosis, but no deep venous thrombosis on the left.
Patient was then sent for MRI of the pelvis which showed no evidence of clot in the femoral vein or IVC.
It is unusual why the patient would have pulmonary embolism since there is no recent history of travel or long car rides.
Left subclavian artery clot status post embolectomy.
Given the patient's symptoms of neurological and vascular compromise in his left upper extremity, Vascular Surgery was consulted.
They eventually took him for embolectomy of a very large subclavian artery clot.
The echocardiogram actually revealed a patent foramen ovale with a right-to-left shunt in light of a normal pulmonary pressure with PR gradient of 17 mm Hg.
Also noted on the echocardiogram was preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, mild right ventricular dilation, mildly depressed right ventricular function, and apical-septal aneurysm.
Given the right-to-left shunting and embolization without elevated pulmonary artery pressure along with his known deep venous thrombosis, it was felt that a PF closure with a clam-shell would be best.
He was given 48 hours of Vancomycin along with other antibiotics which he was taking for his pneumonia until blood cultures were clear for 48 hours.
Given that the patient had many clots in a situation, where he did not have many risk factors that led to the tests that were mentioned above in the course of finding the etiology of the pulmonary embolism.
It was discovered that he had elevated homocystine levels of 70.5.
There is no literature mentioning whether life-long anticoagulation would be called for in the state of homocystinemia.
The chest x-ray revealed a left basilar infiltrate and left pleural effusion.
In the middle of the hospital course, the patient complained of right ankle and right first metatarsal erythema, swelling, and pain.
He says that these symptoms were similar to his gout flares, so he was given Indomethacin.
The indomethacin helped resolve the symptoms on the right foot, but then he started noticing pain, swelling, and erythema with his left first metatarsal.
