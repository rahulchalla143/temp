Admission Date:  [**2152-12-21**]       Discharge Date: [**2153-1-25**]   Service:  General surgery -- Blue service.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Malaise and low grade fevers and abdominal pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 83 year old female with past medical history significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease, colon cancer, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, who is well known to the general surgery blue service, as she underwent an antrectomy/vagotomy with Bilroth II reconstruction as well as splenectomy and partial pancreatectomy for a large bleeding duodenal ulcer on [**2152-11-25**].
She was sent to the Emergency Department on [**2152-12-21**] with report of fevers, abdominal pain and general malaise, as well as a report of some purulent drainage from her former right upper quadrant [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain site.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease; colon cancer; ventral hernia; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; asthma; noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus; cataracts; arthritis; bleeding duodenal ulcer.
Bilateral hip replacements.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile at 98.6; pulse 80; blood pressure 125/55; respiratory rate 18; oxygen saturation 96% on three liters.
She does have some scleral icterus.
Lungs:  She has decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
Her abdominal examination is significant for softness and obese.
There is a duodenostomy tube with some serous drainage from around the skin site and a feeding jejunostomy in good position.
The prior surgical incision is well healed with no erythema or drainage.
Rectal examination:  No masses, nontender.
Her urinalysis shows positive nitrates and trace leukocyte esterase.
A CAT scan of the abdomen showed a large subcutaneous collection of air and soft tissue.
There were also signs of a dilated afferent limb as well as some stranding in the area around the end of the duodenostomy stump, indicating possibility of a duodenal stump leak.
In addition, the radiologist noted the expected changes following a Bilroth II reconstruction as well as a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy.
However, the duodenostomy contrast study showed a small amount of contrast exiting from the duodenal stump, indicating a slight leak from the duodenal stump.
It was determined that Ms. [**Known lastname **] had an angry abdominal wall abscess which required emergent surgery.
A large subcutaneous abscess was found almost immediately after opening the skin overlying the abdomen, with about 400 to 500 ml of purulent debris draining almost immediately.
This purulent material was washed out with high pressure saline and further inspection revealed that there was a small fascial dehiscence of the inferior aspect of Ms. [**Known lastname **] prior surgical wound.
Otherwise, Ms. [**Known lastname **] abdominal fascia was intact and once this was repaired, two Penrose drains were placed to assist with the drainage of the subcutaneous layer.
Intraoperatively, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had several episodes of hypotension which required the administration of pressure support.
In addition, the abdominal wound was packed with Betadine soaked Kerlix and the Penrose drains assisted with the drainage.
Wound cultures taken during this procedure eventually grew out Vancomycin sensitive enterococcus, pseudomonas, [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans, the anaerobe Prevotella, for which Ms. [**Known lastname **] was put on intravenous antibiotics.
She continued to have twice daily dressing changes with wet to dry gauze of her abdominal wound in the subcutaneous layer.
However, she bounced right back to the Intensive Care Unit after she suffered an episode of confusion, low grade fever and tachycardia.
Respiratory:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] did have some wheezing difficulties, for which she continued on her Flovent.
Gastrointestinal:  During this time on the floor, Ms. [**Known lastname **] has been sustained with a combination of parenteral and enteral nutrition.
Hematology:  There were no issues.
Infectious disease:  After being treated for several days with intravenous antimicrobials, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have some low grade fevers on [**12-27**].
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was started on Voriconazole for this but she subsequently had a dramatic increase in her creatinine.
Renal:  As mentioned before, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a poor reaction to Voriconazole with rising creatinine.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a wrist x-ray obtained which did not show any fractures or any pathology.
Skin care:  It was noted on [**1-6**] or so, that Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a small ulcer or area of induration on her sacrum.
An ostomy nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] and the patient received Duoderm intermittently to help prevent development of a worse decubitus ulcer.
Wound:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] surgical wound has been packed on a twice daily regimen, early morning on rounds and in the evening after rounds by the surgical house officer.
She still does put out a small amount of greenish feculent material.
To the patient's right, there is also another wound at approximately 10 o'clock.
There is a subcutaneous tunnel connecting these two which is also packed with the Kerlix.
To the patient's left of the midline wound is a small connection to another subcutaneous cavity.
At the deep layer of this cavity is a enterocutaneous fistula from which the feculent material drains.
At the inferior aspect of this left sided cavity, there is another Penrose drain which is sutured in place as well.
