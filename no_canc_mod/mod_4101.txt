History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 21860**] is a 60 year old male with multiple cardiac risk factors.
He had complaints of worsening dyspnea on exertion which prompted a stress test which was positive for ischemia.
Echocardiogram in [**2175-5-9**] showed no valvular pathology and an LVEF of 60%.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization in [**2175-5-9**] was notable for severe two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a 99% stenosis, with 70% lesion in the first diagonal, and 90% stenosis in the circumflex system.
Past Medical History: Diabetes Mellitus Type I Chronic Renal Insufficiency Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Peripheral Neuropathy Diabetic Retinopathy Bilateral Cataract Surgery Bilateral Vitrectomy Prior Right Foot Surgery   Social History: Quit tobacco in [**2151**].
Family History: Denies premature coronary artery disease.

Left ventricular function.
Mitral valve disease.
Valvular heart disease.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Given his chronic renal failure, the renal service was consulted to assist in postoperative management while all medications were titrated accordingly.
On postoperative day two, he developed atrial fibrillation which was successfully treated with Amiodarone and beta blockade.
For the remainder of his hospital stay, no further episodes of atrial fibrillation were noted.
He did experience a further decline in renal function as his creatinine peaked to 4.4.
He however, did not become oliguric and dialysis was not indicated.
