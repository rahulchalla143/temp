The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2110-1-28**] to [**2110-2-2**] for dyspnea and was treated for a COPD excaerbation with steroids and azithromycin.
The patient endorsed dyspnea walking even 30 feet.
He was not given steroids or nebulizers.
Further review of systemts notable for minimal cough, no fever, and no chest pain.
He does not occasional paroxysmal abdominal pain for which a RUQ u/s on [**1-28**] was negative for acute pathology.
He thinks that his shortness of breath has been much worse since [**2109-12-23**], allthough clearly he must have marked dysfunction given disability [**2-24**] dyspnea.
Past Medical History: # COPD - was seen frequently at [**Hospital6 **].
Echo in [**2110**] on recent admission within normal limits # Hypertension # Lower Extremity Edema # Hypertension .
barrel chested, unable to speak comfortably in full sentences HEENT: no oral ulcers CV: RRR s1, s2, soft holosystolic murmur present.
No increased P2.
ABD: soft, obese, some minimal tenderness to palpation of RUQ EXT: marked venous stasis changes of distal extremities bilaterally.
only 1+ edema at this time, but patient reports has been much worse.
Skin: diffuse acne   Pertinent Results: [**2110-2-21**] 06:10PM   GLUCOSE-74 UREA N-20 CREAT-0.8 SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-5.1 CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-34* ANION GAP-13 [**2110-2-21**] 06:10PM   ALT(SGPT)-53* AST(SGOT)-28 LD(LDH)-384* CK(CPK)-143 ALK PHOS-93 TOT BILI-0.5 [**2110-2-21**] 06:10PM   LIPASE-16 [**2110-2-21**] 06:10PM   cTropnT-0.02* [**2110-2-21**] 06:10PM   CK-MB-7 proBNP-150 [**2110-2-21**] 06:10PM   TOT PROT-6.5 [**2110-2-21**] 06:10PM   WBC-9.1 RBC-5.19 HGB-15.4 HCT-45.4 MCV-87 MCH-29.6 MCHC-33.9 RDW-13.4 [**2110-2-21**] 06:10PM   NEUTS-66.8 LYMPHS-25.0 MONOS-5.9 EOS-2.0 BASOS-0.3 [**2110-2-21**] 06:10PM   PLT COUNT-204 [**2110-2-21**] 06:10PM   PT-12.6 PTT-26.0 INR(PT)-1.1  [**2-21**] CXR: No evidence of congestive heart failure.
No pulmonary embolus, no evidence of aortic dissection.
Small nodular densities in left lower lobe, with secretions in the trachea, likely small foci of aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 y/o man with long smokign history admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with makred dypnea and lower extremity swelling likely due to a COPD exacerbation.
# Dyspnea: Likely COPD exacerbation with recent overall decline given new O2 requirement this month.
Also likely has an element of OSA given his inability to sleep laying down (3-pillow orthopnea) as COPD alone would not cause this.
CHF essentially ruled out by normal BNP and hypotension after lasix.
Given wheezing and marked smoking history, it seems that this is a continued presentation of a partially treated, severe COPD exacerbation.
# Likely obstructive sleep apnea:  Patient was tried on CPAP overnight, and had one successful night, and a second without relief.
# Lower Extremity Edema: Appears consistent with chronic venous insufficiency, not CHF as above.
Could have some element of cor pulmonale, but echo 2 weeks ago inconclusive though showed mild RV dilation but no TR.
# RUQ abdominal pain: The patient has intermittent sharp, RUQ abdominal pain as an outpatient and had an episode overnight which resolved within 30 minutes.
Not related to food intake, however the sharp quality and location raise concern for cholecysistis.
LFTs this revealed only a slightly elevated ALT.
He will need abdominal CT if the pain persists.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypercarbic respiratory failure COPD with acute exacerbation Small pneumonia, possible aspiration.
Lower extremity edema Abdominal pain, Right upper quadrant.
Likely obstructive sleep apnea.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath, due to a asthma/obstructive lung disease exacerbation.
You also have evidence on your chest CT of a possible mild pneumonia.
Your abdominal pain was evaluated with an ultrasound, and you have no gall stones.
Return to the emergency room if you get worse, with worse shortness of breath, abdominal pain, LE swelling, nausea or vomiting, chest pain.
