Echo [**2133-2-11**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with global hypokinesis and inferior/infero-lateral akinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 11426**] is an 81-year-old woman with severe CAD 3-vessel CAD ( LMCA 70%, LAD 100% occlusion after D1, LCX 99% proximal, RCA 100% ostial disease, no stent) DM2, HTN, HL, who originally presented to OSH with epigastric pain.
Several minutes later returned to asystole, was given epi 1mg x 1 and had brief compressions, returned to tachycardia rhythm.
EKG significant for new LBBB.
Given 0.5mg atropine twice, then 1 mg, also given 1mg ativan x 2 for agitation between episodes.
Intervals of tachycardia between asystole shortened in length.
Pt was examined and had no spontaneous respirations, no carotid pulse, no heart sounds, and dilated and fixed pupils.
Cause of death coronary artery disease with cardiac arrest.
# CORONARIES: On admission, troponin 1.5, CK 368, MBI 11%, ECG with worsening of STE in inferior leads and new TWI laterally.
Given her extensive diffuse disease and multiple medical comorbidities, no intervention was undertaken and medical management was optimized, including heparin, aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, and eptifibatide drip.
# Hypotension:  The patient was initially hypotensive requiring dopamine and then phenylephrine.
It was unclear whether she was in cardiogenic or distributive shock.
# Urinary tract infection:  The patient had a positive urinalysis and was treated with a dose of gentamicin followed by Bactrim.
# PUMP: No sign of heart failure on exam.
Echocardiogram showed EF 20% with moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
# RHYTHM: Patient was in sinus rhythm until the peri-mortem events as above.
# CKD: baseline Cr likely 1.3; now 1.8.
