She was in her USOH at about 9 pm this evening, when she developed an acute onset headache.
Her son notes that she then became sleepy and her right eye turned in.
Neurosurgery evaluated her in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and felt there was no intervention needed at this time.
Past Medical History: Osteogenesis Imperfecta s/p torn R ACL surgically repaired Lumbar disc disease  Social History: Drinks 15 beers/wk, no smoking, no illicits.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
-Sensory: Responds to pain in all four extremities.

No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
No evidence of stenosis or occlusion or abnormal vascular structures seen.
CT Head ([**2107-4-1**]): Left mid brain and cerebral peduncle hemorrhage with minimal worsening of surrounding edema.
No change in fourth ventricular blood with the blood within the occipital horns less conspicuous.
CTA Head ([**2107-4-1**]): Left-sided mid brain hemorrhage with extension into the fourth ventricle and the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally.
No intracranial aneurysms, vascular malformations.
Persistent patchy and linear left basilar opacities, most likely atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 36 y/o F with a hx of osteogenesis imperfecta who presents following sudden onset of diplopia, dysarthria, lethargy and headache.
She was confused and disoriented upon arrival of EMS and transfer to [**Hospital3 **].
Had documented GCS of 5 there when the hemorrhage was found.
Subsequent MR/MRA showed an acute midbrain hemorrhage in the tegmental region with mild surrounding edema and findings indicative of mild-to-moderate obstructive hydrocephalus.
Had only minor subsequent headaches and "left ear discomfort", both of which were well-controlled on acetaminophen and not associated with any worsening neurological deficits.
Exam improved over hospital course, but patient had residual diplopia at baseline with findings of diplopia at end gaze bilaterally, R eye hyperconvergence, L eye inward on vertical gaze, impaired vertical/lateral eye movements and temperature deficit of RUE.
Bleed was felt to be attributable to an underlying vascular malformation (cavernous hemangioma) not well-visualized on imaging in the setting of an acute bleed.
Medications on Admission: None (stopped OCP's several months ago)  Discharge Medications: Acetaminophen 1g Q6H PRN  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Life Care at Home of [**State 350**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute midbrain hemorrhage, likely [**1-29**] cavernous hemangioma.
Discharge Instructions: You had a bleed in your brainstem that was most likely caused by a vascular malformation.
This was the cause of your symptoms of double vision, difficulty speaking and headache.
If you have any symptoms such as a new change in vision, trouble speaking, difficulty swallowing, a change in sensation, numbness, abrupt weakness in your arms or legs, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations or any other concerning symptoms, please follow up with your physician or return to the Emergency Room for further evaluation.
Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with your Primary Care Physician within the next week in order to get written referrals for your appointments with the neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**], and the neuro-ophthalmologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
