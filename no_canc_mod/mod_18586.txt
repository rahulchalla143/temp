On [**2153-12-7**], he had had a STEMI s/p 6v CABG, was extubated [**2153-12-9**], and then shortly went into PEA arrest.
He was found to have an embolic stroke in left parietal, left internal capsule region.
While in house he developed fevers 100-101 with neg cultures but +LLL pna.
On admission patient endorses pnd, orthopnea, and loose stool x 2 d. Denies chest pain, palpitations, nausea/vomiting/urinary sx.
Past Medical History: Hypercholesterolemia Hypertension CAD s/p CABG in Fl (6 grafts placed, left main, prox lad and right post descending artery) Afib w/ hx of embolic stroke, L parietal and L external capsule w/ right sided hemiplegia in [**12-5**] h/o heparin induced thrombocytopenia PNA s/p trach [**2153-12-18**] ARF s/p Dialysis [**2153-12-21**] New type II diabetes mellitus   Social History: Worked as the director at [**Hospital3 **] Health center.

CXR [**2154-1-11**]: IMPRESSION:  Stable large bilateral pleural effusions.
Mild hydrostatic edema.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 62 year man with coronary artery disease status 6 vessel CABG [**2153-12-7**] that was complicated by stroke (on anticoagulation), CHF (EF 25%), pneumonia and  respiratory failure.
He was readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with tachypnea from a rehabilitation facilty.
Of note the patient had a recent pna with coag + staph, with hypoxia, tachypnea, increased wbc.
His presentation over the next few days appeared more consistent with a CHF exacerbation rather than a pneumonia so the chief goal was to optimize his volume status.
Repeat echo revealed EF of 40%, and a small loculated pericardial effusion, no sign of tamponade.
In summary, this is a 62 year old gentleman with CHF (EF now 40%), CAD s/p recent CABG complicated by respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and complicated by CVA on anticoagulation.
He was admitted for tachypnea/respiratory distress likely secondary to CHF exacerbation.
Currently with good respiratory status after diuresis and optimization of heart failure medications.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1) nebulizer Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) nebulizer Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Congestive Heart Failure exacerbation Secondary: Status post tracheostomy for respiratory failure Status post CABG for 6 vessel coronary artery disease Diabetes type II   Discharge Condition: Good, breathing normally on 2 L nasal cannula.
Still with some volume overload but vastly improved compared to presentation.
Hemodynamically stable on congestive heart failure medications.
No signs of infection.
No signs of ischemia.
