HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old lady with a history of COPD, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and obstructive sleep apnea who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2110-11-10**] with a COPD exacerbation and CHF exacerbation.
The patient reports some dietary indiscretions in the week prior to admission.
However, the patient denied weight gain or lower extremity edema during this time.
She does note that she was having increasing shortness of breath, lethargy, and tremor over this time.
The patient reports that she has baseline exertional dyspnea, becomes short of breath after walking only a few steps.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient denied any chest pain, worsening cough, fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting.
The patient's daughter attributed the patient's symptoms of increasing lethargy, shortness of breath, and tremor to worsening hypercapnia and brought her mother to the Emergency Department for further evaluation.
She was started on antibiotics and a steroid taper for COPD exacerbation.
Atrial fibrillation.
Diastolic congestive heart failure.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Lungs:  Bilateral crackles approximately two-thirds of the way up the lung fields.
Extremities:  There was 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema.
There was a prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.
Bilateral pleural effusions were present.
There were faint opacities at each lung space, most likely representing atelectasis.
EKG:  Sinus rhythm with atrium premature beats and a first-degree AV block.
Marked left axis deviation, left ventricular hypertrophy, most likely no change since the previous tracing of [**2109-9-16**].
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient was with probable diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation most likely secondary to dietary indiscretion.
The patient's shortness of breath improved symptomatically throughout admission.
In addition, her oxygen requirement decreased dramatically.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE EXACERBATION:  The patient received IV Solu-Medrol during her stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Diastolic congestive heart failure.
Congestive heart failure exacerbation.
