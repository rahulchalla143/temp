HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old female who was brought to the [**Hospital6 2018**] from [**Hospital3 **] with a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction and what was noted as a history of incarcerated ventral hernia.
The patient had been noted to initially present with severe right-sided abdominal pain with associated nausea and vomiting.
She was previously seen at an outside hospital a few days prior, but had been discharged home after was diagnosed with a partial small bowel obstruction, but returned again with similar symptoms.
PHYSICAL EXAM:  On initial presentation, the patient's pulse was in sinus tachycardia in the 110s, with the blood pressure 120 systolic, respiratory rate was noted to be 20, and she was satting 95% on room air, and was otherwise noted as afebrile.
The skin evidenced no rash or jaundice.
The heart was, as mentioned, in sinus tachycardia, but there was no rub.
There was a considerable amount of right-sided abdominal tenderness with some guarding.
A large ventral hernia was notable.
HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) SURGERY:  The patient was admitted on the [**9-17**], and on that same day underwent abdominal exploration, at which time the ventral hernia was repaired, and there was significant lysis of adhesions, and the patient also required a partial small bowel resection for an incarcerated area of hernia which was somewhat strangulated and perforated.
Postoperatively, she continued to require intubation for her respiratory status.
As noted, she was maintained on sedation during intubation, but otherwise had no neurologic deficiencies postoperatively.
2) RESPIRATORY:  As noted, the patient did have some evidence of pulmonary edema secondary to a significant positive balance in terms of fluids, for which she was aggressively diuresed during her postoperative course.
There was no evidence of any sort of cardiac damage.
The patient had significant difficulties with tachycardia and although her blood pressure has remained control, this was attributed to be secondary to the body stress response, and the patient was on IV Lopressor.
Otherwise, the patient had no notable cardiac issues.
4) RENAL/GU:  The patient did make an excellent amount of urine, as noted, due to her significant volume overload and diuresis.
5) FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient did require TPN postoperatively, as she was NPO, and she was intubated for quite some time.
There were no complications associated with this TPN, and she was taken off her parenteral nutrition several days prior to discharge.
Her significantly positive fluid balance, as noted previous, was handled with aggressive lasix diuresis, for which she was initially on a lasix drip but eventually converted to PO lasix.
Multiple blood cultures were positive for coag-negative Staphylococcus in aerobic and anaerobic bottles.
The patient evidenced no urinary tract infection on any urine cultures drawn.
Her stool did not show any evidence of Clostridium difficile.
Sputum cultures only grew flora, and no other organisms were noted.
Note:  Her JP fluid also grew some coag-negative Staph.
She was able to maintain adequate hydration, and had no more respiratory difficulties.
Vasotec:  The patient was not discharged home on her prior dose of vasotec, as she had achieved excellent blood pressure control.
