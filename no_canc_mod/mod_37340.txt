She was thought to have an asthma exacerbation, for which she was given nebs, steroids; NO abx.
An EKG was performed and by report demonstrated new TWi in III,avF (new); this EKG is uanavilable.
A CXR was also performed and was negative for any acute process and no evidence of hyperinflation.
+ usual sharp epigastric abd pain (resolved).
Past Medical History: - morbid obesity s/p hernia repair [**6-1**] and gastric bypass surgery - OSA on nocturnal BIPAP (18/15) and 2-3L home O2 - obesity hypoventilation syndrome - pulmonary HTN thought from OSA and obesity hypoventilation - right heart failure - h/o iron deficiency anemia - asthma: last PFTs in [**4-5**] with marked obstructive defect and FEV1 of 38%.
Also had [**Month (only) **] FVC suggestive of restrictive defect - Hypertension - Osteoarthritis of bilateral knees   Social History: The patient lives with her two sons.
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: T 98.3F, 114/50 76 20 94% 3L Gen: Comfortable, obese, speaking in full sentences HEENT: PERRL, anicteric Neck: Supple, no JVD appreciated.
Lungs: Diminshed bilaterally, scattered fine crackles at bases, wheezes superiorly Cor: s1s2 RRR, distant Abd: Obese, soft, NT/ND; multiple well-healed scars, mobile, non-reducible mass at epigastrium 6x6 cm.
Ext: non-pitting edema bilaterally symmetric, increased from baseline per patient.
CXR [**2124-3-17**]: Unchanged cardiomegaly with evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension and vascular congestion.
No overt evidence of pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pneumonia.
CXR [**2124-3-18**] - IMPRESSION: Unchanged evidence of cardiomegaly and enlargement of the pulmonary arteries, suggesting pulmonary hypertension.
No evidence of acute pulmonary edema .
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The  aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve  leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe pulmonary artery  systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is  increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

# Hypoxia: Pt has known baseline poor pulmonary function, with history of hypoxia and is on home O2, 2.5L at rest, 3L while ambulating.
There is no correlation with pulse oximetry at these settings.
She had a recent admission for asthma exacerbation and finished her predinsone taper 2 days ago.
Her volume overload was felt to be due to decreased dose of torsemide during last admission and increased Na load with tomato soups.
On initial exam she had minimal wheezing, but ~10 lb weight gain and fine crcakles bilaterally.
Based on crackles and elevated BNP there was concern for volume overload.
Patient was transferred to the floor and her exam was consistent with volume overload.
Patient never had shortness of breath or chest tightness during this admission.
Patient had persistent symptoms of nasal congestion, post nasal drip and clear sputum with occaisional cough.
# EKG changes: By report new TWI in inferior leads.
No complaints of chest pain or pressure.
An official interpretation of ECG showed RAD, RV Hypertrophy and diffuse ST/T changes without interim change from [**2124-2-21**].
# Abdominal pain: The patient had no abd pain on admission and was tolerating a diet without a problem.
This issue has been extensively evaluated on previous admission, she had recent abdominal CT at [**Hospital1 18**] with no acute issues found.
# Renal insufficiency: Baseline creat difficult to assess, was 1.0 on last discharge and is 1.4 currently.
Pt was volume overloaded.
It is likely that her euvolemic Cr is slightly elevated as pt w/ Hx of HTN and RVHF.
# PPX: SC heparin given to prevent DVT (watch PLTs closely); .
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol 2 puffs q4h prn SOB 9.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] [**Location (un) 269**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: CHF (diastolic) exacerbation Secondary: Cor Pulmonale, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Asthma, Morbid Obesity.
Discharge Condition: Stable, with improved oxygenation, free of abdominal pain.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to low oxygen levels and weight gain.
These were felt to be due to to heart failure exacerbation.
