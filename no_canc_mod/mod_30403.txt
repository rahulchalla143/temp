Admission Date:  [**2184-2-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-2-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2117-8-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14802**] Chief Complaint: Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Suboccpital craniotomy for evacuation hematoma   History of Present Illness: This is a 66 year old gentleman with history of ischemic left cerebellar stroke 1 week ago who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] as a transfer from an OSH where he presented following a headache.
Imaging showed hemorrhagic conversion of his ischemic stroke so he was transferred to us for further evaluation and potential intervention.
He has residual neurologic deficits from a right sided CVA in [**2178**] as well as deficits from his history of Polio.
He has no changes in his neurologic status when compared to following his ischemic stroke.
He reports that he had dizziness and gait disturbance following his recent cerebellar CVA.
He complains of moderate headache, denies nausea, vomiting, dizziness/lightheadedness currently, changes in vision, hearing, or speech.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Coordination: + dysmteria LUE on FNF, unable to assess on right given polio   Pertinent Results: Head CT [**2184-2-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Left cerebellar intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated surrounding edema in the left PICA territory, raising possibility of hemorrhagic transformation of an infarct vs primary parenchymal hemorrhage.
Possible trace subarachnoid blood in the fourth ventricle 2.
Mild effacement of the quadrigeminal cistern, partial effacement and rightward shift of the 4th ventricle as well as some fullness of the foramen magnum but no frank herniation of the cerebellar tonsils.
No hydrocephalus.
Head CT [**2184-2-3**]: IMPRESSION: Area of mixed attenuation in the left cerebellar hemisphere may relate to acute hemorrhage with surrounding edema or hemorrhagic conversion of an infarct.
Mass effect on the left fourth ventricle on to the left side along with distortion of the left side of the pons and mid brain and mild rightward shift of the structures.
No significant change noted compared to the recent study done on the same day.
Head CT [**2184-2-3**]: IMPRESSION: Interval evacuation of cerebellar hematoma with residual left cerebellar blood products and surrounding edema.
Mass effect on the fourth ventricle and pons are improved with mild residual distortion.
Head CT [**2-5**]: IMPRESSION: Interval significant increase in left cerebellar hemorrhage, with increased crowding in the collicular cisterns and compression and displacement of the fourth ventricle to the right, and extension into the left tonsil which crowds the foramen magnum.
Head CT [**2-5**]: IMPRESSION: Interval decreased in size of left cerebellar hemorrhage with slightly decreased but persisent local mass effect.
Head CT [**2-6**]: IMPRESSION: No significant change in left cerebellar hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
Recommend MRI if not contraindicated to better assess for infarction.
Head CT [**2-7**]: IMPRESSION: No change in the left cerebellar hemispheric hematoma, edema and associated mass effect, when compared to studies of [**2-6**] and [**2184-2-5**].
Head CT [**2-9**]: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of left cerebellar hematoma and associated mass effect.
No acute intracranial changes.
He had a repeat CT head that showed nosignificant changes.
He was taken to the OR for a suboccipital decompression.
Intraop there was no complications and the patient did well.
Post-operatively, he returned to the ICU for monitoring.
A stat Head CT was performed and was consistent with significant increase in left cerebellar hemorhage.
The patient was taken to Operative Room emergently for evacuation of cerebellar hemorhage.
The head Ct was consistent with expected postoperative changes.
The patient became confused and aggitated but was easily redirected and a CIWA scale was initiated for Dts.
A NCHCT no significant change in left cerebellar hemorrhage with surrounding edema sinc ethe post operative NCHCT.
On exam, the patient was oriented to person , place, and time, the pupils were equal and reactive, there was a limited up gaze, pupils were slightly dyscongugate and there was a right gaze preference.
There was no pronator drift.
Incision was clean with minimal staining and some CSF fluid.
A head CT was ordered to evaluate any fluid collection and showed stable hemorrhage with decrease in edema.
5. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for itchiness.
6. diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pruritis.
10. polyvinyl alcohol-povidon(PF) 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**11-24**] Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eye.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cerebellar hemorrhage Cerebral edema   Discharge Condition: AOx3.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
