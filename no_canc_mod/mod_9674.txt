Second surgical intervention required a prolonged hospitalization, complicated by a gangrenous gallbladder.
The patient was noted to have recurrent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, noted by a CAT scan obtained by the patient's primary care physician.
The aortogram revealed a tortuous thoracic aortic aneurysm as well as involvement in the abdominal aorta.
Hypercholesterolemia treated with diet.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Thoracoabdominal aneurysm times two.
Status post cholecystectomy in [**2121**], secondary to gangrenous gallbladder postoperatively.
Chest x-ray showed severe aortic dilation and tortuosity with no acute pulmonary disease.
However, he was noted to have a fever of 101.2.
On postoperative day number two, the patient spiked a fever to 102.6.
On postoperative day number three, due to copious secretions and gram negative rods, she had a bronchoscopy done at the bedside which revealed significant tracheobronchitis and increased secretions.
On postoperative day number four, the patient had some rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated with intravenous Amiodarone.
On postoperative day number five, the patient remained having rapid atrial fibrillation.
However, she was reintubated a short time later on the same day due to increased respiratory rate and decreased oxygen saturation.
The following day, the patient received a left pleural chest tube for pleural effusion.
She had a repeat bronchoscopy which showed decreased secretions.
She underwent echo due to some worsening hypotension, which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 20% which was significantly decreased from her previous value of approximately 60.
She went to cardiac catheterization due to her new echocardiogram findings and this revealed only mild coronary artery disease.
It showed also left renal artery stenosis with non flow limiting retrograde dissection of the right common iliac artery as well as 80% left common iliac artery stenosis.
The patient had been started on inotropic support due to her decreased hemodynamic status as well as her decreased left ventricular ejection fraction.
She underwent another bronchoscopy on postoperative day number nine, [**6-13**], which revealed mild secretions.
On [**6-15**], she was again noted to be febrile with increased agitation.
She underwent another bronchoscopy which showed minimal secretions and no further evidence of tracheobronchitis.
She underwent CT scan of her abdomen, due to continued fever, which revealed hematoma at her graft site.
She was placed also on intravenous Fluconazole prophylactically because she was developing a thrush in her mouth and also continued with significant endotracheal tube secretions.
The patient was also noted to have profuse diarrhea that day and Clostridium difficile studies were sent, which ultimately returned as negative.
She remained agitated but appeared to be stable from a respiratory standpoint.
On [**6-19**], the patient was noted to have an asystolic episode which spontaneously reverted to bradycardia, which quickly resolved to a normal sinus rhythm.
No intervention was required at that time.
It also revealed no apical thrombus.
The patient, however, failed swallow evaluation at that time.
Later in the day, the patient was again reintubated due to continued respiratory distress.
A bronchoscopy was performed upon reintubation which revealed minimal secretions.
The [**6-22**], Ciprofloxacin was added to the patient's antibiotic regimen, due to pseudomonas now obtained from her sputum, in order to double cover, as she was continued with increased secretions.
On [**6-24**], postoperative day number 20, it was noted that the patient had a positive heparin induced thrombocytopenia screen.
This was felt to be safe to no longer anticoagulate the patient since she had been six days at that point with no cardiac arrhythmias, no further blocking down, no further atrial fibrillation, negative deep vein thromboses were also documented on the 15th.
She had an upper extremity deep vein thrombosis due to left arm swelling but both upper and lower ultrasounds were negative for deep vein thrombosis.
She was continued on her antibiotic coverage for her resistant pseudomonas and was continued to improve from a ventilatory standpoint.
The patient also was noted to have a dehiscence of her small abdominal wound for the gastric tube placement.
There was no sign of infection or drainage at that time and the wound was just managed with sterile dressing changes.
The patient begun to wake up more calmly and follow commands more appropriately, not requiring the previous level of sedation that she had due to agitation.
Again, the patient was noted to have an increased serum amylase level in the 200 range.
There was questionable abdominal pain at that time but it was inconsistent.
She ultimately had no further abdominal symptoms.
Tube feeds were resumed on the [**7-8**], due to a decreasing amylase and absence of abdominal symptoms.
Over the next few days, the patient's amylase, while it remained elevated at 174, pretty consistently for three days, she had no abdominal complaints of pain, no nausea, was tolerating her tube feeds at goal rate.
She had remained off the ventilator now for approximately one week, tolerating her tracheostomy collar with cool mist humidified oxygen, requiring tracheostomy suctioning approximately twice a day due to secretions.
The patient has remained stable and is ready to be discharged from the hospital to rehabilitation facility, to undergo increased physical therapy to increase her mobility and exercise tolerance as well as increased oral intake and ultimate weaning from her tube feed over the next few weeks.
every four hours prn for pain or fever.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
