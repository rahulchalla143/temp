Admission Date:  [**2136-2-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-2-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-11-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: Mesenteric Ischemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known firstname 449**] [**Known lastname 31251**] is a 74 year old male who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for concern of possible bowel ischemia.
Mr. [**Known lastname 31251**] reports he presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2136-2-3**] with bloodydiarrhea and abdominal pain and was admitted overnight and discharged with antibiotics (flagyl).
He returned to their ER [**2136-2-5**] with worsening abdominal pain and was admitted for further work up and put on levofloxacin and flagyl.
He has since had increasing abdominal pain which he describes as intermittent and he describes it as gas pain that is sharp in nature.
He received several abdominal CT's over the next 4 days that showed progressively worsening edema and thickening of the bowel wall but without evidence of free air.
He also had leukocytosis to 18K with a left shift; stool cultures were negative as of time of transfer.
He denies having any sick contacts or family history of GI illness.
Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 31251**] recently had a CVA 6 weeks ago on [**2135-12-18**] that presented with left facial droop which has resolved but has persistent bladder incontinence.
He had originally been on coumdin for history of afib and PE but was switched to pradaxa since the CVA and begriming about 2-3 weeks ago he reports the presence of hematuria for which he presented to his PCP but had not had any interventions.
About 1 week ago he stared experiencing bloody diarrhea as noted above, with accompanied incontinence to stool for which he presented to [**Hospital3 **].
Past Medical History: PMH: Afib, dilated cardiomyopathy - resolved, PE s/p cardiac cath, glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, DJD, gout, hypertension, CVA - [**12-23**] - now with urinary incontinence, essential tremor  PSH: none  Social History: Retired Police Officer from [**Location (un) 5110**].
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: PE: T96.2 HR 83 BP 104/68 RR 18 02Sat 95RA GEN: NAD, AOx3 CV: Irregularly irregular, rate controlled, nl s1 and s2 PULM: CTA b/l, no respiratory distress ABD: Soft, mildly tender in lower quadrants bilaterally, BS (+), non-distended, no rebound or guarding.
Rash and Stage II ulcer on left buttock and gluteal cleft.
EXT: No c/c/e, MAE, no gross motor deficit   Brief Hospital Course: The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2136-2-9**] for possible mesenteric ischemia.
A consult was placed to the Infectous Disease department.
The patient had one episode of rapid heart rate to the 150s.
On HD4 the patient was switched to IV digoxin and IV beta blocker for better rate control of his atrial fibrillation.
Medicine was consulted for work up for patient's diarrhea and GI bleeding.
The patient was transferred to the MICU for closer management of Atrial fibrillation with RVR.
74 with Afib with rvr, dialated cardiomyopathy, HLD, HTN, s/p PE, recent stroke who was initially transferred from the medical floor to the MICU for management of Afib with RVR in the setting of diarrhea, enteritiss, palpable purpura and petechiae indicative of possible vasculitis.
Subsequently developed intermittent bowl obstruction which improved at times with NG tube.
Started on steroids [**2136-2-16**] for suspected GI vasculitis.
Decompensated on [**2136-2-19**] with hypoxemic respiratory failure and septic shock requiring mechanical ventilation and pressors.
He was initially extubated successfully for 4 days before being intubated again [**2136-2-25**], given recurrent tachypnea and Hypotensive episode.
He then developed 2 large volume upper GI bleeds requiring 7 units of prbc and then a family meeting took place.
Differential included aspiration pneumonitis and mucous plugging, unlikely to be acute heart failure or pneumonia given clear CXR.
First extubation failed and the patient was reintubated 4 days later due to persistent tachypnea.Continued Abx coverage with Vancomycin and Zosyn for presumed HAP given fevers/sputum cx grew MRSA.
#Hypotension- At times during the admission the patient became hypotensive to SBP to the 70's.
He did grow MRSA from 1 blood cx which was treated with Vancomycin.
His BP during his admission was mostly stable above SBP>120 without any support .. # UGIB/SBO: KUB and RUQ consistent with SBO concerning ischemic colitis or mesenteric ischemia.At time had high NG output, including cofee ground, bilious output  In the differential is vasculitis, mesenteric emboli from atrial fibrillation, and atherosclerosis.
# Enteritis: clinically most likely to be same process as in skin where biopsy shows Medium to small vessel vasculitis.
Had CT abdomen which revealed isolated jejunitis and ileitis.
Autoimmune serologies were negative and Rheumatology recommended to start steroids for presumed vasculitis.Thought to be most consistent  with LCV vs. HSP-like process.
# Rash ??????
Leading diagnosis is vasculitis  as above largely based on skin biopsy.
Improved in last 24 hours of life, unclear what led to improvement, but may have been due to high dose pulsed steroids.
Worsened RVR with fever spikes and episodes of hypotension related to the GI bleed.
# Renal Failure /Hematuria/Proteinuria: may be prerenal azotemia but will have to balance with risk of pulmonary edema.Combination of renal contrast and pre renal during admission which recovered with fluids.
In last 3 days of life Creatinine was trending up in the setting of recent Hypotensive episode and intubation.
# Elevated Lipase:In the differential was bowel obstruction as etiology though more likely is pancreatitis, no nausea, vomiting, some epigastric tenderness, could be pancreatitis caused by medications, or potential autoimmune .
# elevated INR: likely secondary to poor nutritional status.Reversed to 1.2 with vitamin K. # Nutrition:Continued TPN.
Exam: Pupils fixed and nonreactive to light No heart sounds No lung sounds No response to nail bed pressure No carotid pulse  Wife, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 31251**], notified.
