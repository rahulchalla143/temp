Patient underwent angio for mapping that showed below the knee multiple vessel disease, had a bump in creatinine going from 1.3->1.9 and was held in house for observation.
In the AM of [**2176-3-13**] he appeared well, but around per the wife had been complaining of some chest pain the night before; a rapid response team was called at 7:54, and at 815 code was intitated for an unclear prior rhythm.
Given the finding of positive Trop, complete heart block with new LBBB morphology, and large wall motion abnormalities, he was taken to cath lab for presumed CAD leisions.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a question of further management with potential bypass surgery, transffered on heparin gtt, dopamine gtt.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.

Moderate mitral regurgitation.
At least mild aortic stenosis.
Moderately severe acute pulmonary edema and probable bilateral moderately large pleural effusions.
- CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2176-3-13**] 5:45 PM IMPRESSION: Low position of intra-aortic balloon pump, proximal position of orogastric tube, and change in positioning of transvenous pacing lead.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo M with HTN, HLD, DM, no known CAD s/p SFA stent for RLE non-healing ulcer, who coded x 2 at [**Hospital3 **], found to have diffuse 3 vessels disease, presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management with possible surgical intervention.
# PUMP: The patient was felt to be in cardiogenic shock on arrival, initially on dopamine gtt, ultimately uptitrated to 3 pressors with dopamine, levophed, and vasopressin.
The patient's bedside echos both at OSH as well as in-house showed  focal hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall, anterior septum, inferior wall, and apex, as well as dyskinesis of the distal inferior wall.
Cardiogenic shock as also presumed given the global hypoperfusion indicated by the patient's elevated lactate and anion gap acidosis.
The inciting factor for cardiogenic shock was not clear, but the patient in the cath lab at OSH was noted to have 3VD, and there were comments in OSH regarding arrhythmia, which seems to be the two most likely factors to have instigated cardiogenic shock.
# CAD: The patient has diffuse 3VD not amenable to stenting; at OSH, it was not felt feasible or safe to perform stenting procedures.
Patient was continued on heparin gtt, ASA, Atorvastatin, and Plavix for a presumed myocardial infarction.
# RHYTHM: The patient was noted by OSH reports to have been in 3rd degree heart block, and during his codes was noted to have a wide complex tachycardia, with variations between [**Hospital1 **].
The patient was paced intra-venously, but on arrival was having difficulty maintaing its position and having the heart capture said beats, results in occasional need for transcutaneous pacing.
The patient does not have any history of any underlying rhythm abnormalities, but is is very possible that a rhythm distrubance precipitated hypoperfusion of the heart, causing it to become ischemic, causing poor EF causing global hypoperfusion.
# Neuroprotection s/p arrest: Patient is not a candidate for Artic Sun Cooling protocol given the amount of time since his event and start of cooling.
He was noted to have poor neurologic signs, such as occasional lower limb jerking, unresponsiveness, and a lack of pupillary response to light.
Likely secondary to poor renal perfusion secondary to cardiogenic shock  # Transamitinits: Likely secondary to poor hepatic perfusions  # Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to an inflammatory resposne secondary to patient's global hypoperfusion.
The patient is not currently febrile, and CXR shows diffuse bilateral infilitrates not consistent with a PNA.
