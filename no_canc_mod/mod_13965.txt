Admission Date: [**2189-12-27**]        Discharge Date: [**2190-1-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-5-6**]        Sex:  F  Service:  NSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76 year old woman who was transferred from an outside hospital with complaints of right sided headache times one month and gait instability times two to three weeks.
She initially presented to an outside hospital on [**11-12**] status post a fall secondary to a syncopal episode.
She has complained of constant headache daily since fall with a new onset of gait instability starting one to two weeks the fall.
Both have progressively worsened with no photophobia, nausea or vomiting.
Head CT showed bilateral subdural hematomas, acute and chronic with midline shift to the left.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, angina, irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was in no acute distress.
Chest clear to auscultation, no murmur, rub or gallop cardiac-wise.
She had no clonus.
Head CT with contrast again showed the same as the outside CT.  Mixed attenuation bilateral subdural hematomas with 1 to 1.5 cm of midline shift to the left.
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close neurologic observation.
She was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1132**] and was taken to the operating room on [**12-28**] for burr hole evacuation of a left sided subacute subdural hematoma.
There were no intraoperative complications.
She was started on lisinopril and then it was discontinued due to hypotension.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without ischemia.
On [**2190-1-2**] she complained of abdominal pain with distention and diarrhea and vomiting.
She had a KUB which showed partial bowel obstruction and a CT of her abdomen which showed mildly dilated loops of small bowel without a clear transition point.
This likely represents partial small bowel obstruction.
There is no evidence of complete obstruction as air and contrast are seen throughout the colon down to the rectum.
She also has bibasilar pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
The patient was kept NPO  She did have diarrhea which resolved on its own and a C difficile toxin which came back negative.
She was therefore not started on antibiotics for C difficile at this point.
