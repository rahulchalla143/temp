- ?cause for chest pain likely from critical AS instead of obstructive coronary disease.
- will continue to ROMI - continue ASA for now, pt states has not been held yet pre-operatively.
- continue lipitor but increase dose to 80 qd (as too late now but can help progression of AS disease) - hold carvedilol temporarily as BP now 90's likely secondary to overdiuresis and multiple NTG tablets.
And pt is pre-load dependent with his critical AS and thus should not bring down BP too much.
PUMP- Critical AS with EF 40%, Peak Gradient 88, Mean Gradient 54, [**Location (un) 109**] 0.7 - Possibly, pt in CHF secondary to high salt intake at dinner today.
However, pt has also been having chest pain for the past few days and may have coronary cause for CHF.
- Continue lipitor for critical AS - AVOID nitrates in critical AS patients, will be cautious with carvedilol and holding parameters for SBP<100.
- ?cath in AM to further assess for critical AS pre-operatively.
- continue amiodarone.
- If afib recurs, consider repeat cardioversion.
HTN - pt now relatively hypotensive given overdiuresis, lots of nitro.
Full CODE Pt cathed on [**1-11**] which revealed mild diffuse disease with LAD 30%, CX 40%, RCA 40%, LVEDP 19, right dominant.
had a brief period of hypotension at induction per Dr.[**Name (NI) 3502**] operative note.
Pt went back into afib and amiodarone and carvedilol were restarted.
