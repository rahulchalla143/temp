Flexible bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 58457**] is a 48 year old woman with hepatitis C induced cirrhosis.
She developed a large right effusion over a year ago and was treated with a PleurX catheter with continuous drainage.
She underwent a thoracoscopy with partial lung decortication and a mechanical as well as talc pleurodesis.
Postop course was complicated by a Staph aureus pleural infection.
Ultimately she had a reasonably good result but recently has had progressive dyspnea once again and was found to have recurrence of her right sided pleural effusion.
CT imaging demonstrated a fibrothorax as well and trapped lung.
After long discussions about a high risk of recurrence and the fact that she needs a liver transplant, she decided she did not want to continue to live dyspneic as she is and is willing to move forward with surgery, understanding that there is a high risk of recurrence.
Her hepatologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], felt this was due to her aggressive diuresis.

Family History: father - COPD  Pertinent Results: Post-op: [**2172-5-15**] 12:29PM   WBC-7.6 RBC-3.85* HGB-11.4* HCT-33.1* MCV-86 MCH-29.7 MCHC-34.5 RDW-13.6 [**2172-5-15**] 12:29PM   PLT COUNT-117* [**2172-5-15**] 12:29PM   GLUCOSE-143* UREA N-48* CREAT-1.4* SODIUM-134 POTASSIUM-5.1 CHLORIDE-106 TOTAL CO2-22 ANION GAP-11 [**2172-5-15**] 12:29PM   CALCIUM-8.2* PHOSPHATE-3.5 MAGNESIUM-2.0 .
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2172-5-15**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2172-5-18**]):    NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2172-5-21**]):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
PATHOLOGY: DIAGNOSIS:  Right pleural tissue:  Fibrous tissue with extensive foreign body giant cell reaction with associated polarizable foreign material.
Focal reactive mesothelial hyperplasia.
Small fragment of lung parenchymal tissue.
No malignancy identified.
Cytology:  DIAGNOSIS: Pleural fluid, right:    NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
CHEST: Post-op chest shows position of two chest tubes on the right side in satisfactory position and resolution of the pre-operative right effusion.
No pneumothorax is identified.
The left lung is clear, some atelectasis is seen on the right side.
No pneumothorax.
[**5-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-15**] and 2 at 5:39 a.m.:  Lung volumes only mildly lower following tracheal extubation.
Little if any right pleural effusion has accumulated, and there is no pneumothorax.
Right basal atelectasis is more pronounced.
Subcutaneous emphysema in the right neck has increased and needs to be followed to exclude a communication between the pleural space and subcutaneous tissues.
Gaseous distention of the stomach persists.
[**5-17**] CXR: Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates no interval change in the three right-sided chest tubes seen on [**2172-5-16**].
There is a small right-sided pneumothorax, slightly more conspicuous than seen previously.
Right basilar atelectasis persist.
No left-sided pleural effusion.
Subcutaneous emphysema is again noted.
No consolidation is evident.
[**5-18**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-15**] through [**5-17**]:  Low lung volumes suggest this film was taken at suboptimal inspiration accounting for worsening atelectasis in the region of surgery at the base of the right lung.
There is no appreciable right pneumothorax.
A small amount of right pleural thickening or fluid along the lateral costal pleural surface is stable.
Small left pleural effusion is new or newly apparent and there is increasing atelectasis at the left base.
Subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall and right neck is stable.
[**5-20**] CXR: CHEST PA AND LATERAL: Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
Right lateral lower lung opacities are again identified.
The left lower lobe atelectasis and possible small effusion is improved.
3 chest tubes are present in the hemithorax as previously demonstrated with subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall.
No pneumothorax.
Pleural effusion or thickening is present in the right costophrenic region and focal asymmetric pleural density at the right lung apex, unchanged.
Atelectasis at the right lung base.
Minimal apical pneumothorax is still present.
No significant change in the right pleural thickening/effusion and atelectasis of the adjacent lung is demonstrated.
No increase in pleural effusion is demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: Minimal residual apical pneumothorax on the right.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 58457**] was admitted on [**2172-5-15**] after a decortication and mechanical pleurodesis.
Both chest tubes were placed to suction with an air leak noticed immediately.
This was noted to be a sinus tachycardia and as her blood pressure was stable and she was not hypoxic it was felt to be secondary to pain and hypovolemia.
She continued to be tachycardic after adequate volume resusciation, but she continued to have significant difficulties with pain control.
Once her pain was stablized on her home regimen of oxycontin and lamotrigine the tachycardia resolved.
She was also started on salt tabs and a fluid restriction once adequate resuscitated for hyponatremia (sodium as low as 128).
The air leak resolved after several days and the CT output was minimal at the time of removal.
One CT was removed on POD 7 and the second was removed on POD 8 with only a small, stable apical pneumothorax noted after removal.
At the time of discharge on POD9 the pleurex catheter was capped and her pain was adequately controlled.
