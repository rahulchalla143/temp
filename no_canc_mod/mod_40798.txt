HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 83-year-old male has a known history of coronary artery disease with aortic stenosis.
He was referred for outpatient cardiac catheterization to further evaluate the progression of his aortic disease.
He is status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the right coronary artery in [**2184**] and is status post repeat cardiac catheterization in [**2186**] revealing the RCA to be patent and no other significant disease noted.
The patient has been experiencing exertional angina for the past six months to a year.
He has some left arm numbness that occurs at the end of one and a half miles and also chest tightness and dyspnea after he walks up hills.
His most recent echocardiogram done on [**2191-4-1**], revealed moderate aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.9 cm squared and a peak aortic gradient of 64 mm/Hg with a mean aortic gradient of 42 mm/Hg and an ejection fraction of 55%.
There was [**11-18**]+ atrial regurgitation and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
History of chronic back pain.
Status post oral infection three weeks ago which is now resolved.
History of PTCA and stenting of the right coronary artery in [**2184**].
Status post multiple knee surgeries.
History of intestinal polyps removed which were complicated by postoperative infection requiring temporary colostomy.
ALLERGIES:  He is allergic to penicillin.
Vital signs stable.
No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Abdomen was obese, soft and non-tender with positive bowel sounds.
No masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2191-5-23**], which revealed the left ventricle had heavily calcified aortic valve and mitral annular calcification.
The ventriculography was not performed because of an increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure and history of renal failure.
His left main coronary had a 70-80% proximal stenosis.
The left anterior descending had mild luminal irregularities with proximal serial 30% stenoses.
The left circumflex had diffuse mild luminal irregularities, moderately calcified diffuse proximal 20-30% stenoses.
He had a carotid ultrasound which showed no significant stenoses bilaterally.
He had Neuro consult identifying any progression of abnormalities noted on prior films in the cervical region.
He was cleared for surgery by Neurology and on [**5-25**] he underwent an aortic valve replacement with a #21 mm [**Company 1543**] porcine valve and a coronary artery bypass graft times two with saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending and obtuse marginal.
He continued to progress well and on postoperative day two in the late afternoon he had two long conversion pauses after a run of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
