Admission Date:  [**2103-1-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2103-2-2**]   Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year-old male transferred from [**Hospital6 14576**] with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, CRI, hypertension presenting with shortness of breath, chest pain and ruled in for a non Q wave myocardial infarction with troponin highs of 14.5.
Echocardiogram showed severe aortic stenosis, 0.5 cm squared and an ejection fraction of 35%.
The patient presented with mid sternal chest pain radiating to both arms, arm heaviness, and fatigue, question short of breath.
The patient went to the Emergency Department and chest pain was relieved after one nitro and has been chest pain free since.
He has had increased chest pain with exertion for the past one and a half years.
Also increased chest pain with eating, fifteen minutes after eating.
No fevers or chills.
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no cough, no lightheadedness, no syncope.
History of five or six years of chronic lower extremity edema.
No abdominal pain after meals.
No hematochezia, polyuria.
No transient ischemic attack symptoms.
Chest bibasilar rales.
3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur loudest at apex, radiates to carotids.
No organomegaly.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Vascular bilateral femoral bruits, bilateral carotid bruit, question radiating from aortic stenosis.
2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
Left arm slight intention tremor.
Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 70, left axis deviation down sloping ST depressions in 1 through AVL, V4 through V6 versus left ventricular strain.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service on [**2103-1-19**] for complaints of chest pain at which time the patient ruled in and was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] from [**Hospital3 **].
The patient's kidney function was also assessed as acute on chronic renal failure, which at that time was attributed to prerenal failure.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization showed left main coronary artery with no significant obstructive disease, left anterior descending coronary artery with 60% stenosis in the mid portion, left circumflex 70% proximal, 90% stenosis at the obtuse marginal one, 90% distal obstruction and right coronary artery with small nondominant 70% mid vessel stenosis.
At that time it was thought that because of the patient's three vessel disease that he should proceed to Cardiothoracic Surgery for coronary artery bypass graft.
In addition, the patient was worked up for his carotid disease and the vascular laboratory reported carotid stenosis of 80 to 99% of the right coronary artery and no flow detected in the left internal carotid.
A renal consult was obtained for the patient's acute on chronic renal failure at which time the following recommendations were made, to hold off on the patient's diuretics, review urinary sediment and to hold on the patient's ace inhibitor and to avoid nephrotoxins.
It is believed that the patient's acute renal insufficiency was due to redo contrast nephrotoxicity.
The chronic renal disease was secondary to diabetes.
The patient had no evidence of atheroemboli.
On hospital day five the patient was noted to have flash pulmonary edema.
The Stroke Service was consulted in order to place a stent in the right internal carotid artery before the patient's aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient was found to have severe right coronary artery stenosis.
The patient was seen by cardiac surgery at which time possible risks and complications were explained to him and consent was signed.
The patient was cross clamped for 115 minutes and cardiopulmonary bypass times 147 minutes.
A #19 mm CE Bovine pericardial valve was placed.
The patient's blood gases were normal at that time and on postoperative day number two the patient continue to resolve without neurological deficits.
The patient's blood pressure also elevated and renal recommended Norvasc 2.5 mg po q day.
The patient is to have voiding trial in one week and is leaving with a urinary leg bag.
The patient is to follow up with nephrology and with the Neurological Stroke service.
