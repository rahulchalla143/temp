Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with stent placement to L cirucmflex artery and rescue of jailed OM.
History of Present Illness:  71 year old gentleman with coronary artery disease, neg Exercise MIBI in [**2130**] with LVEF of 63%, who presented with 5 hours chest pain which began last night.
Pain was on both sides of chest and pt believes it may have been associated with some shorntess of breath.
No loss of consciousness that he can recall.
There he was found to have 99% LCx lesion and 70% OM lesion.
Wedge 25, pt became hypoxic eventually oxygenating only 87-89 on NRB; initial ABG 7.36/56/40.
[**Hospital3 5097**])in setting of exertional CP.
with inf and ant ischemic changes.
He stopped because of fatigue.
There was no chest or other discomfort.
There were no significant ST segment changes.
Nuclear images showed no perfusion abnormality.
-hypertension -hyperlipidemia .
Bilateral venous varicosities.
Chest: Lungs, scattered rales, decreased breath sounds anteriorly.
S1S2 with 3/6 systolic murmur at apex and base.
No hematoma, no bruit.

CXR: Mild congestive heart failure.
Small left pleural effusion.
Opacity in the left lower lobe could represent atelectasis, although early pneumonia is also possible.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant patient  revealed two vessel CAD.
The RCA had moderate diffused disease up to 60% in the proximal and mid portions.
The LMCA was angiographically normal and the LAD system had mild luminal irregularities.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevation of right and left sided filling pressures with RA mean of 13mmHG and PCWP of 25mmHG.
There was moderate pulmonary hypertension at mean PA 35mmHG.
ABG revealed severe hypoxia at the end of the case which responded to lasix and IV nitro without necessitating intubation.
Echocardiography:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This 71 year old gentleman with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity presented with 5 hours of chest pain  and was found to have an ST elevated MI for with he underwent emergent cardiac catheterization with stent placment to LCx with rescue of jailed OM1.
Likely hypoxia was secondary to fluid overload from necessary fluids periprocedurally.
Post cath EKG revealed resolution of the ischemic changes, his cardiac enzymes peaked later that afternoon (CK 1399 MB 13.7 Trop T 2.87).
Post cath revealed preserved LV systolic function and preserved RV function with no wall motion abnormalities in either ventricle.
No evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
The patient remained chest pain free and hemodynamically stable after his catheterization and his cardiac enzymes trended downward.
He had no further episodes of respiratory distress.
In summary, this is a 71 year old gentleman admitted to the CCU for inferior STEMI status post catheterization with DES to L circumflex artery.
Post cath course complicated by respiratory distress secondary to volume overload successfully treated with diuretic therapy.
Pt remained chest pain free and hemodynamically stable throughout his post cath course to discharge.
Issues and plan from this hospitalization:  1) Cardiovascular, STEMI s/p cath, elevated wedge pressure a) Perfusion--STEMI (deep ST depressions in precordial leads STE in aVR) s/p cath to LCx (99% lesion) c OM1 rescue (70% residual stenosis) -ASA, plavix, -Pt started metoprolol which was changed to Toprol XL on discharge, also restarted felopidine in hospital.
-Pt to continue lisinopril, discontinued hydrocholorothiazide b) Pump, last EF 63%, repeat echo revealed preserved RV and LV funcion with no wall motion abnormalities.
-continue Toprol, lisinopril c) Rhythm, pt remained in NSR, no episodes of ventricular tachycardia on telemetry post MI d) Follow up: with PCP and arranging to be followed by cardiologist at [**Hospital1 18**] (Either Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] .
Pt carries diagnosis of pulm fibrosis.
3) History of stomach ulcers with ASA.
4) BPH -continued proscar .
5) FEN -heart healthy .
