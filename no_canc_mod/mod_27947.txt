Complicated diverticular disease 2.
Question of a mucosal lesion in the mid small bowel   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Extended left hemicolectomy with mid small bowel resection   History of Present Illness: 70-year-old female with diverticular disease complicated by abscesses, had undergone multiple percutaneous drainage procedures without resolution of her abscesses.
HTN 2. depression/anxiety 3. chronic back pain 4. perforated diverticulitis s/p IR placement of drainage catheter [**1-17**], subsequently developed an abscess cutaneous fistula.
Chronic anemia 7.
Asthma - mild, intermittent, no longer uses inhaler  Social History: No smoking, EtOH, or IVDU.
MID SMALL BOWEL SEGMENT (2 JARS).
Colon; extended left hemicolectomy (A-N):  Diverticulosis with fibrosis, chronic inflammation and focal foreign body reaction (see comment).
Skin / colonic mucosa with reactive changes, consistent with ostomy site.
The histologic appearances are consistent with previous diverticula rupture    2.
Small bowel, mid; segmental excision (O-AH):  Focal transmural defect lined by small intestinal-type epithelium with associated fibrosis, acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation and foreign body reaction to fecal material (see comment).
Margins of resection with focal acute serositis.
The small bowel pathology is most likely related to the patient's complicated diverticular disease with abscess formation and abscess drainage.
Sections of bowel away from the involved areas show no significant mucosal disease.
It consists of a segment of colon measuring 80.0 cm in length and up to 5.0 cm in diameter.
The mesenteric and pericolic fat show a few areas of hemorrhage and induration.
The serosa of the bowel has a few areas of erythema, but is otherwise grossly unremarkable.
No other mucosal lesions are identified.
No discrete lesions are identified on sectioning the area of thickening.
These measure 10 cm in length x 4 cm in diameter (larger specimen ) and 6.5 cm in length x 5.5 cm (smaller specimen).
There are occasional diverticula.
The specimen is represented in cassettes as follows: A =  5 cm stapled margin line end; B = ostomy site (skin and attached mucosa); C-E = sections of diverticula; F = section of thickened area 10 cm from 5 cm stapled margin line; G = sections of unremarkable appearing mucosa; H = section of mesenteric fat adjacent to thickened mucosal area with possible lymph node; I-J = sections of pericolic fat with possible lymph nodes; K = sections from larger additional segment of colon (margins); L = section from larger additional segment of colon with possible diverticulum; M = sections from smaller additional segment of colon (margins); N = sections from smaller segment of colon (area of hemorrhage and bowel).
Part 2 is additionally labeled "segment of mid small bowel."
However, there are two firm areas, measuring 2.5 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm and 2.2 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm, located on opposite ends of the segment of small bowel.
The specimen is represented as follows: O = margin from 2.1 cm stapled end; P = margin from 2.2 cm stapled end; Q-T = sections of entirely submitted firm area (from side with suture); U = sections of unremarkable small bowel mucosa; V-AA = sections of entirely submitted 2nd submucosal firm area (from the opposite non-sutured end); AB,AC = entirely submitted mesenteric fat with lymph node adjacent to sutured submucosal firm area; AD, AE = second entirely submitted lymph node found upon dissecting mesentery; AF-AH = additional sections of small bowel..

Call your doctor or come to the emergency room if you develope a fever, if you can't eat or drink, or if the incision site becomes infected-looking (red, hot or draining pus).
