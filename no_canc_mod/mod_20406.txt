Emergency medical services took the patient the morning of admission with substernal chest pain to [**Hospital3 **], electrocardiogram with ST elevations and she was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for catheterization.
Right coronary artery with severe mid disease, occluded in the more distal segment.
With the exception of generalized weakness and chronic cough since [**Month (only) 1096**].
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notes a 10 pound weight loss over the last few months and dyspnea on exertion, weakness and fatigue.

Skin with no rashes or lesions.
Electrocardiogram with normal sinus rhythm, normal intervals, normal axis, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in 1, 2, V5, V6, ST depressions in V2 and V3.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 81 year old woman with hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presented with ST elevation myocardial infarction.
She came from catheterization with chronically occluded right coronary artery and obtuse marginal 1 status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty stenting of the occluded obtuse marginal 1.
Hemodynamics on catheterization showed increased wedge pressure.
ST elevation myocardial infarction - The patient with an inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction with CK peaked in the 1200 the morning after cardiac catheterization.
Initially the patient had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on telemetry but this resolved within 24 hours after catheterization and repletion of her potassium.
Chronic cough - The patient was noted to have a chronic cough in the past since [**Month (only) 1096**].
