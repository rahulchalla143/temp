There appears to be oligemia to the right lung base with a cut off of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery ([**Last Name (un) 92544**] sign), suspicious for a pulmonary embolus.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is resent.
There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: Oligemia of the right lower lobe suggestive of pulmonary embolus.
Extensive pulmonary emboli are present bilaterally, involving the distal right main pulmonary artery as well as the lobar, segmental, and subsegmental branches bilaterally.
Dilation of the right ventricle and widening of the main pulmonary artery to 3.4 cm are highly concerning for right ventricular strain and pulmonary hypertension.
No consolidations or pleural effusions are present.
No mediastinal, hilar, or axillary adenopathy is present.
Several small non-pathologic mediastinal nodes are observed.
Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are limited but show no abnormalities.
There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with findings concerning for right ventricular strain.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Nonocclusive deep venous thrombus in the left popliteal vein.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 92543**] is a 60M with PMH of nephrolithiasis who is presenting with 4 days of DOE, found to have elevated D-dimer, and large b/l PE on CTA.
# Pulmonary embolus:  Patient was found to have a large b/l PE on CTA, accounting for his DOE.
D-dimer was found to be 2815, and BNP elevated to 2394; troponins were negative.
TTE in MICU showed some right ventricular dilation and decreased free wall motion and LENI showed nonocclusive deep venous thrombus in the left popliteal vein.
# Elevated hematocrit: Resolved during admission.
Possible that the patient has an element of sleep apnea (given habitus), and is a chronic retainer, which would account for this elevation.
Other possibilities include hemoconcentration vs. primary blood dyscrasia, like [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], which could also account for his hypercoaguable state.
# Acute renal failure: Resolved during admission.
He will be contact[**Name (NI) **] about scheduling a colonoscopy in the next month, and has been set up for PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 1944**] clinic appointments.
You were admitted for shortness of breath and were found to have blot clots in your lungs bilaterally.
The cause of these blood clots is unclear and will need to be worked up as an outpatient.
