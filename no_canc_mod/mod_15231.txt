Admission Date:  [**2194-12-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2194-12-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2147-8-21**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 47 year old obese male with a history of end stage renal disease of unclear etiology on hemodialysis since [**2194-3-20**] complains of shortness of breath and chills during hemodialysis on the day of admission.
He was transferred from his outpatient dialysis unit to transplant surgery team at [**Hospital6 256**] for evaluation of his arteriovenous graft.
Initially the patient had a subclavian tunnel catheter that was found positive for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in [**2194-9-20**].
On [**10-26**], the patient's left upper extremity arteriovenous graft was noted to have some purulent discharge, the patient had shakes and chills, however, was afebrile and had a normal white blood cell count.
In addition, over the weeks prior to admission the patient had multiple blood cultures drawn for unclear reasons at hemodialysis that were positive for Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus that were sensitive to Ampicillin and Penicillin.
On admission the patient also complained of increasing low back pain over the last three days.
The patient has chronic low back pain at baseline.
He has a history of a lumbar abscess/osteomyelitis that required surgical drainage and [**Location (un) 931**] rod placement in the thoracic through the lumbar spine to help with spinal stability in [**2184**].
The patient received a left upper extremity ultrasound which revealed a patent graft with some inflammatory changes but no fluid collection, however, there was a small thrombus outside of the graft itself.
The transesophageal echocardiogram showed a 2 by 1.2 cm pedunculated vegetation on the atrial side of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with moderate points for regurgitation and a mild stream of mitral regurgitation at the leaflet base indicating a small perforation.
There was no surgery performed.
On admission the patient had severe asterixes and myoclonus.
After approximately one and a half weeks of hospitalization with multiple dialysis treatments the symptoms seemed to resolve.
Over the past ten years the patient has had recurrent pneumonias with multiple admissions that required intubation.
Two weeks after he discontinued for pericardial infection the patient developed spinal abscess.
Spinal abscess that required surgical drainage and rehabilitation (to learn to walk again) at [**Hospital3 4419**] Center.
Spinal instability requiring two [**Location (un) 931**] rod placements in [**2184**] after spinal abscess removed.
Kidney failure, the patient was told that his end stage renal disease was secondary to nephrolithiasis.
Five years ago the patient was extremely fatigued and was diagnosed with calcinosis in his skin.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis, the patient commonly has low blood pressure, shakiness and chills after hemodialysis.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, unclear of length and duration of time but the patient is on Coumadin on admission.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Obstructive sleep apnea, this is apparent in old note, however, the patient has never been officially diagnosed as he is not on a CPAP machine.
History of hepatitis B.
Chronic low back pain.
The patient says that he had an negative human immunodeficiency virus test over the past year.
He denies cigarette use but has a history of pipe smoking.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Maternal grandmother died of a cerebrovascular accident.
Mother with cystitis and multiple urinary tract infections.
Father died from a motor vehicle accident in [**2194-3-20**], (around the time the patient became sick and was restarted on dialysis).
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for shortness of breath on exertion, fatigue, increased sleepiness, increased urination over the past month (the patient has had very little urine output over the previous month).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  P  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Significant for a temperature of 101.6, systolic blood pressures 94 to 120s, pulse 115 to 150s, respirations in the 30s, 99% on 3 liters, 262 pounds, morbidly obese male in moderate respiratory distress.
He was taking shallow breaths, was tachypneic and spoke in 2 to 3 word sentences.
The patient appeared very anxious.
Unable to appreciate jugulovenous distension, however, the patient has a large thick neck.
S1 and S2, distant tachycardiac and irregularly irregular pulse.
LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram, with rapid atrial fibrillation.
Chest x-ray with low lung volume, cardiomegaly but no fluid seen.
Endocarditis - The patient was found to have large vegetation on transesophageal echocardiogram on admission to the hospital.
Sensitivities from his Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus isolates from the outside hospital were sensitive to Ampicillin and Penicillin, however, initial isolates from [**Hospital6 256**] were resistant.
Given the patient's history of a rash to Ampicillin once the isolate returned sensitive to Ampicillin and Penicillin, the patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit for Penicillin desensitization.
Initially the patient had high temperatures but once Penicillin was started his temperature curve trended downward.
He had a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram that showed an interval decrease in the size of the posterior mitral valve defect vegetation.
However, there was an additional small perforation in the valve itself.
No abscesses were identified at that time.
Besides the patient's two transesophageal echocardiograms, he did have a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 60 to 65%, and a moderately dilated left atrium.
A abdominal computerized tomography scan done during hospitalization showed small probable infarct of the spleen.
In addition, the patient had congestive heart failure during the hospitalization.
Given his congestive heart failure, and embolic events, Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted twice during hospitalization.
Initially the patient had multiple cultures positive for Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bacteremia.
Intravenous antibiotics - Initially the patient had very poor venous access and therefore on admission to the Medicine Team a right PICC line was placed.
After approximately one week the left subclavian line was discontinued and sent for culture.
It was negative for bacterial growth.
Atrial fibrillation - Initially the patient presented with rapid atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Congestive heart failure - Although the patient's body habitus limited the examination, it appeared the patient had significant amount of congestive heart failure during his admission.
He did not feel short of breath and he no longer feels that he is working hard to breathe and says that he is very comfortable.
He has 3+ mitral regurgitation associated with his mitral valve vegetation.
End stage renal disease - The patient has end stage renal disease of unclear etiology.
The patient had multiple episodes after hemodialysis where he became hypotensive.
His left upper extremity graft was found positive for Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and this graft was removed by Transplant Surgery.
During hospitalization he had a drop in hematocrit multiple times and required multiple units of packed red blood cells.
In addition the patient had a left groin hematoma secondary to an attempt at line placement.
There were no other sources of bleeding noted.
Subdural hematoma - During an episode of confusion the patient tried to climb out of his bed to go to the bathroom and fell on his forehead.
He had a superficial laceration on the midline forehead and over the bridge of his nose.
At that time a computerized tomography scan of his head was performed that showed a small subdural hematoma.
Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status - On admission the patient had a baseline slightly confused mental status.
During his stay in the Intensive Care Unit for Penicillin desensitization the patient had a change in mental status and Neurology Team was consulted.
A computerized tomography scan of the head was done which showed atrophy but no new infarct.
Electroencephalogram was done that did not show seizure activity.
The patient is extremely anxious at baseline and therefore was on the Benzodiazepine.
He seemed to be a little slow in his responses.
Low back pain - Over the first few days of hospitalization, the patient complained of increasing low back pain.
In addition he complained of weakness and difficulty walking and he lost some stool.
Rectal examination revealed poor sphincter tone.
At that time it was unclear whether this was a new neurologic change or residual effects from the patient's prior infection and surgery procedure.
Anesthesiology was consulted and felt that conscious sedation would be the best treatment.
However, the patient remained with myoclonus and severe asterixes which would have diminished the value of the magnetic resonance imaging scan in evaluating for an abscess and spinal cord compression.
Neurosurgery was consulted and they felt that without point tenderness in the spine and without objective weakness in his legs on examination, a spinal cord compression was unlikely.
The patient's back pain diminished during the hospitalization.
The Infectious Disease Team felt that if there was an abscess there, as long as there were no neurological signs an intravenous antibiotics for eight weeks should treat the infection.
Increasing white count - The patient's had increasing white count after about one week of intravenous Penicillin.
A Clostridium difficile culture was positive for Clostridium difficile and the patient was placed on Flagyl.
New onset rash - The patient was discovered to have what appeared to be a dermatomal rash on the right upper abdomen with erythema and excoriations in the left lower abdomen.
