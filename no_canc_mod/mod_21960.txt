She began to experience abdominal discomfort approximately one week PTA.
Over the next one week, [**Known firstname 57951**] only complained of occasional lower abdominal pain.
Her UA on that day showed no protein in the urine.
She was admitted on [**7-5**] for planned induction of pregnancy with some concern for pre-eclampsia/PIH.
She denied any fevers, headaches, neurologic symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any vaginal bleeding.
She did not noticed any darkening of her urine, jaundice, or scleral icterus.
Past Medical History: Removal of Left breast mass at around age 13, benign Anemia   Social History: [**Male First Name (un) **] at [**Doctor First Name **] college.
[**Name (NI) **] T/E/D use, family and SOB supportive.
Family History: Mother with hypothyroidism, father with elevated cholesterol, one brother has schizophrenia, two other sibs healthy.

Neck	Supple, no LAD, no palpable thyroid nodules.

Breathing comfortably CV	reg rate and rhythm, nl S1/S2, 1/6 SEM best heard @ LLSB, no radiation.
Skin	warm and dry w/o rashes; no petechiae, no ecchymoses.
Postpartum, she developed rapidly progressive acute renal failure, elevated LFTs and pancreatic enzymes, elevated uric acid level, as well as profound thrombocytopenia and anemia.
In addition to her abnormal CBC, she demonstrated elements of hemolysis including decreased fibrinogen and haptoglobin as well a peripheral smear showing abundant schistocytes, occasional teardrop forms, many hypochromic and microcytic RBC's, occasional target forms, and rare acanthocytic/burr cell forms.
She also continued to bleed both from her epidural site and from a labial tear sustained during labor.
She did not experience significant neurologic compromise.
She was evaluated by hematology and nephrology and was felt to have a microangiopathic hemolytic process in the HUS/TTP/HELLP/DIC spectrum, as she demonstrated signs and symptoms of each of these syndromes during her stay.
She was intubated on [**7-16**] for pulmonary edema.
ENT was consulted and fiberoptic scope revealed edema and granulation tissue in posterior glottis/subglottis.
On [**2157-7-25**] the decision was made to hold plasmapheresis as [**Known firstname 57951**]??????
On [**2157-7-29**] the right IJ plasmapheresis port was removed without complication.
Detailed hospital course by system/day is as follows: Briefly, this is a 24 yo female, G1P1, s/p induced vaginal delivery after suspected pre-eclampsisa, who postpartumly developed progressive anemia, leukocytosis, and mild to have HELLP given hemolysis, elevated LFTs and mild thrombocytopenia.
However, given renal failure, and shistocytes, pt also likely has HUS/TTP like syndromes.
Therefore, her disease probably represents an overlap syndrome of HELLP/HUS/TTP/DIC.
Finally, given findings of teardrop, target cells, likely also has underlying hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell or thalassemia.
#2 pheresis with FFP.
HD#4 ([**7-8**]), coagulopathy improving s/p 16 FFP, 12 PRBC and 4 platelets, but with increased [**Month/Year (2) **] distention and worsening pulm status (SOB and WOB) and was subsequently intubated.
This was thought to be transfusion induced lung injury vs pulmonary edema vs pulmonary hemorrhage given her coagulopathy vs ARDS, was treated with lasix and NTG gtt to reduce preload.
no pheresis  HD#6 ([**7-10**]): remained sedated/intubated.
?191) with slight increase in bleeding.
?s smear showed [**12-24**] schistocytes/HPF (increased from the smear three days ago), with persistent NRBCs.
?no overt coagulopathy but with evidence of microangiopathy.
Labs relatively stable with slight plt drop from 60 to 55.
Striderous, scoped by ENT, showed subglottic edema and granulation tissue.
platelets continue to climb slowly, coags normalized, slight drop in fibrinogen and hematocrit since yesterday.
There is a slight drop in fibrinogen and hematocrit (29.5) since yesterday.
More fluid overloaded with increased LE edema, decreased breath sounds and UOP not as brisk as previously, restarted 20mg IV lasix.
No active vaginal bleeding, epidural side no signs of blood collection.
[**7-20**]: no pheresis today, labs nl.
#13 pheresis today.
Renal: developed ARF with onset of her hematological problem, no protein by dipstick or protein/cr ratio.
Developed metabolic alkolosis probably from lasix diuresis, volume contraction, and citrate in the blood product.
Patient still requires occasional lasix due to fluid retention.
CV: developed HTN [**7-13**].
Probably due to volume overload, partially due to resolving pre-eclampsia.
On [**7-15**] BP up to 176/56, started on 25mg QD atenolol and [**7-16**] IV lasix 20mg for pressure control.
Pulm: She developed hypoxic respiratory failure on [**7-8**] probably secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage vs fluid overload s/p multiple transfusion vs ARDS vs transfusion injury.
Flexible laryngoscope revealed edema and granulation in posterior glottis and subglottis, crust in the laryngeal area.
CXR subsequently showed marked improvement of bilateral pleural effusions with residue left sided collection, also complete re-expansion of LLL atlectasis.
On [**7-18**] she had a bronchoscopy, which showed granulation tissue at base of the vocal cord, 40% obstruction at thoracic inlet consistent with dynamic tracheomalacia.
labial hematoma packing removed on [**7-16**], left open to heal by secondary intention.
She was put on empiric coverage for bowel flora with amp/levo/flagyl x 1 wk total, then developed diarrhea, stool c diff negative, ABX (amp/levo/flagyl) d/c'd on [**7-12**].
Initially on Cefzolin for S. aureus prophylaxis, discontinued on [**7-18**] b/c no signs of infection, vagi pack took out on [**7-16**].
