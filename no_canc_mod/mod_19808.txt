Admission Date:  [**2160-1-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-1-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2103-12-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Feldene / Imdur / Nitroglycerin  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**] Chief Complaint: s/p Pulmonary Vein Isolation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pulmonary Vein Isolation Cardioversion   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 21822**] is a 55 year old judge from [**Location (un) 37452**], with a history significant for symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since [**2151**], status post pulmonary vein isolation in [**2158-4-25**], presenting for elective re-do pulmonary vein isolation for recurrent PAF.
Patient reports that along with palpitations, he feels shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and chest pain.
Patient was evaluated by his primary cardiologist in [**Month (only) 359**] and given the above symptoms and lack of medical response, amiodarone was stopped and plan for re-do PVI with pre procedure MRI was put in place.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: [**2151**]: s/p RCA stent (unknown type) [**2157**]: Patent stent, 70% OM3 non obstructive occlusion, no intervention  -PACING/ICD: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p PVI in [**2158-4-25**]  OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: Sleep apnea-CPAP Arthritis Recent history of depression related AF symptoms Hypertriglyceridemia BPH s/p knee arthroscopy Prior bone fractures  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Right arm ORIF [**2156**] with subsequent removal of hardware S/p deviated septum repair in [**2156**]   Social History: He is a family judge in [**Location (un) 37452**].
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTA anteriorly, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
b/l venous sheath in place, no hematoma SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Atrial fibrillation prior to procedure.
Sinus rhythm post-procedure.
The right-sided pulmonary veins consist of right superior and right inferior pulmonary veins with a small accessory pulmonary vein originating near the origin of the right inferior pulmonary vein.
No CMR evidence of anomalous pulmonary venous return or pulmonary vein stenosis.
Incidental note is made of a hyperintense lesion as described above in the right kidney, likely representing a renal cyst.
ECHO ([**4-/2158**]) Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) The right ventricular cavity is dilated There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
ECG: ([**2160-1-1**]) Sinus bradycardia at 43 with PR prolongation and QTc 500.
NA, Compared to the previous tracing of [**2160-1-1**] there is no major change.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 year old with a history significant for symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since [**2151**], status post pulmonary vein isolation in [**2158-4-25**], underwent sucessful elective re-do pulmonary vein isolation for recurrent PAF, however with induced left atrial tachycardia went into persistant atrial fibrillation refractory to cardioversion and ibutilide.
RHYTHM: symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since [**2151**], status post pulmonary vein isolation in [**2158-4-25**], underwent re-do pulmonary vein isolation for recurrent PAF.
The vein was isolated, but shocked into left atrial tachycardia with persistant atrial fibrillation refractory to cardioversion and ibutilide.
Monitored on telemetry throughout hospital course with repeat EKG to ensure no QTc prolongation with ibutilide use.
Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive post-procedure with SBP 90-100 on neo.
Likely from a combination of a-fib with RVR, sedation, and volume depletion from intubation.
No evidence of sepsis, hemorrhage, MI or other systemic insult by subjective or objective exam.
Respiratory Status: Intubated briefly for procedure.
CORONARIES: s/p RCA stent in [**2151**] and repeat cath in [**2157**] showed Patent stent, 70% OM3 non obstructive occlusion, no intervention.
Throughout hospital stay, remained asymptomatic without signs of ischemia on EKG.
Continued medical management for primary prevention with tight control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
Patient did not meet criteria for acute kidney injury and urine output remained adequate.
Percocet 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every four (4) hours as needed for pain for 5 days.
Ibuprofen 600 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 5 days.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Paroxsymal Atrial Fibrillation s/p pulmonary vein isolation Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response complicated by hypotension requiring cardioversion  Discharge Condition: On discharge, the patient is alert & oriented x3, he is fully ambulatory.
You were admitted after an elective pulmonary vein isolation for paroxsymal atrial fibrillation.
Your procedure was complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and a low blood pressure.
You then had another episode of atrial fibrillation without low blood pressure and spontaneously converted back into a normal heart rhythm.
When you last had this procedure, you developed chest pain from pericarditis.
WE MADE THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATIONS: We started OMEPRAZOLE to decrease acid in your stomach which might be precipitating your atrial fibrillation.
