Admission Date: [**2173-3-20**]        Discharge Date: [**2173-4-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-5-12**]        Sex:  Male  Service:  MICU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] is a 65-year- old male with past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, end- stage renal disease on hemodialysis, multiple episodes of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, multiple access issues for hemodialysis with stent stenosis of the left subclavian and right IJ and IVC stents, who was admitted to an outside hospital on [**2173-3-8**] with an episode of nausea, vomiting, and dehydration.
Patient was discharged but had returned to [**Hospital6 4620**] on [**2173-3-19**] with chest pain and shortness of breath that developed while in hemodialysis that day.
The patient had noted an episode of chest pain one day prior to admission which was relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.
One set of cardiac enzymes was negative and a CT angiogram of the chest was performed which indicated no pulmonary embolism.
An ultrasound of his hemodialysis graft of his left extremity demonstrated no thrombosis or abscess.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis secondary to    diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease status post four-vessel CABG.
1 to 2 plus mitral regurgitation complex atheroma of the    aortic arch, PSO, and a normal EF on recent    echocardiogram.
Atrial fibrillation.
History of MRSA infection.
No history of tobacco or alcohol use.
Extremities demonstrate no lower extremity edema, left AV fistula with mild erythema, positive bruit.
The patient has a right femoral hemodialysis catheter without erythema or edema.
Respiratory failure:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] presented to [**Hospital 34228**] complaining of chest pain and was    emergently intubated secondary to hypoxemia and depressed    mental status.
A CT angiogram at the outside hospital was    negative for an aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
There were large bilateral pleural effusions noted which,    upon thoracentesis, were transudative.
A    component of the patient's respiratory failure was felt to    be secondary to a pneumonia which was clearly demonstrated    on chest x-rays.
A sputum culture from [**2173-2-19**] was    positive for E. Coli, two different morphologies,    multiresistant, but this organism was sensitive to    Meropenum, Tobramycin, Bactrim, cefepime, and Gentamicin.
Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] continued to do well status post extubation until [**2173-4-7**] when he developed significant upper chest/neck and upper extremity edema secondary to a worsening SVC syndrome.
His breathing became more labored presumably secondary to decreased chest wall compliance secondary to this edema, potential aspirations, and pleural effusion, and a VVD demonstrated hypercarbia on [**2173-4-9**].
This, because the underlying etiology of his respiratory failure would not be quickly reversible; i.e., SVC syndrome secondary to failing collaterals and potential aspiration.
On transfer the patient had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] stim test to    evaluate for potential adrenal insufficiency in the    setting of his likely septic shock presentation.
His [**Last Name (un) **]    stim test did demonstrate that he was relatively adrenal    insufficient, and hydrocortisone and Fludrocortisone were    initiated.
The patient's sputum culture was positive for MRSA and E. Coli, as above.
Patient's blood cultures from [**2173-3-28**] returned positive for E. coli and he had intermittent meropenem added to Gentamicin at that time.
The underlying etiology of his continued hypertension was unclear, although it was felt to be secondary to a combination of septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, and relative hypovolemia during sessions of CBDH and hemodialysis.
His cardiac function was initially evaluated with transthoracic echocardiogram which demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 percent without significant abdominal aortic compromise or pericardial fluid.
Given his protracted hospital course requiring vasopressors, alternate sources for inferior were evaluated despite the lack of evidence of a significant leukocytosis or fever.
A TEE was performed on [**2173-3-29**] which demonstrated no vegetation.
Repeat CT scan of the abdomen with contrast on [**2173-4-1**] demonstrated no enhancement of these areas of concern.
Stool cultures were negative for C. difficile.
Acute blood loss anemia secondary to gastrointestinal    bleeding:  Mr. Angiostatin had been maintained on ulcer    prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor.
Despite this he    developed hematochezia on [**2173-3-30**] with a hematocrit    that decreased from 29 to 23.
Peripheral vascular disease with multiple-vessel    thromboses:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] was anticoagulated during    hospitalization with intravenous Heparin with a goal PTT    of 6100.
Given his gastrointestinal bleeding the    Heparin was changed for a lower goal PTT.
Unfortunately,    the patient's neck, face, upper chest, and upper    extremities began to become increasingly edematous and    swollen [**2173-4-7**].
Interventional Radiology was    consulted and agreed to perform an IVC venogram to    evaluate for any venacaval thrombus.
On discussion with the interventional radiologist regarding other means for intervening on this SVC, there was felt to be no procedure likely to provide benefit to the patient's situation.
With hemodialysis the patient's neck and upper chest edema was slightly improved on [**2173-4-10**].
Some low-dose    Dopamine was recommended for chronotrophy, although the    patient became tachycardiac with this intervention and it    was discontinued.
End-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes mellitus on    hemodialysis:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] was followed by the Renal    service throughout his admission and was initiated on CVBH    [**2173-3-25**] secondary to continuing total-body fluid    accumulation with decreasing lung compliance while on    mechanical ventilation.
Initially patient's left hemodialysis graft was accessed    with no complications for hemodialysis.
Further hemodialysis sessions were    performed from this line secondary concerns for diminished    blood flow in the left upper extremity secondary to the    SVC syndrome.
The patient will require    stress-dose steroids during any episodes of acute illness    or procedures.
Code status:  The patient was initially DNR with no chest    compressions or shocks but will be reintubated if    necessary.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus:  Mr. [**Known lastname 34227**] was    maintained on insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] protocol for the    majority of his ICU stay as his nutrition was not    consistent given difficult intravenous and enteral access.
His hospital course was complicated by one    episode of diabetic ketoacidosis which was promptly    recognized and treated.
