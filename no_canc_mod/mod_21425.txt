He had a known history of mitral regurgitation.
Echocardiogram [**2198-4-30**], showed severe mitral regurgitation with a myomatous degeneration and bileaflet prolapse, ejection fraction 55 percent, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.
He had a cardiac catheterization on [**2198-6-20**], the day that he was seen with no coronary artery disease, and he is now referred for mitral valve repair to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], who reported his only symptom as bilateral lower extremity edema.
No chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath.
His catheterization showed mildly elevated filling pressures, normal wall motion with four plus mitral regurgitation and ejection fraction of 55 percent.
He had a right dominant system with a 20 percent right coronary artery lesion.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Cerebrovascular accident in [**2197-3-7**], with no residual.
Mitral valve degeneration.
ALLERGIES:  He had no known drug allergies.
His carotid ultrasound on [**2198-7-6**], showed no significant disease bilaterally.
He had a grade III to IV/VI systolic ejection  murmur with excellent S2 heart sound.
His abdomen was soft, obese, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
He had no varicosities.
He had two plus bilateral radial, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
The plan was for him to have a minimally invasive mitral valve repair or replacement with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] scheduled originally for [**2198-8-22**].
Preoperative chest x-ray showed no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
Preoperative electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at 56 beats per minute with atrial and ventricular premature beats and left axis deviation with left anterior fascicular block and left ventricular hypertrophy.
He had no other events.
Later that day, he was anxious and was flailing about a little bit stating that he could not breathe.
He was very anxious and had some rapid breathing.
He had minimal drainage from his mediastinal pleural tubes.
He needed a significant amount of encouragement to cough and deep breathe.
He had decreased breath sounds on the right with rhonchi on the left.
His chest x-ray the day prior showed a 10 percent right pneumothorax.
On postoperative day number three, chest x-ray showed some right lower lobe atelectasis.
The patient had episode of bronchospasm with splinting after chest physical therapy.
He developed atrial fibrillation after his nebulizer treatment this morning.
He went from 69 to 100, in atrial fibrillation with a blood pressure of 106/62, respiratory rate 18, saturating 95 percent on three liters nasal cannula.
His heart rate was irregular and decreased breath sounds but he had better aeration of his right base but scattered rhonchi throughout, a small amount of subcutaneous air over his right chest.
He had hypoactive bowel sounds, but his abdomen was softly distended.
He had two plus peripheral bilateral edema.
He converted from atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm at midnight without any change in hemodynamics.
His lungs were a little rhonchorous bilaterally with some wheezes.
He had some ecchymosis on his right flank near his right thoracotomy incision.
His sternal incision was clean, dry and intact.
His extremities had significant two to three plus bilateral lower extremity edema but was perfusing well.
On the evening of [**2198-9-1**], the patient complained of coughing and having some trouble raising phlegm and general discomfort trying to breathe.
He was completely asymptomatic with a blood pressure of 106/70.
On postoperative day number six, he started Heparin drip for atrial fibrillation.
He was given 5 mg of Coumadin a night earlier for atrial fibrillation.
The next day the patient had some complaints of pain.
He had scattered rhonchi but no rales.
Amiodarone and Coumadin are continued for atrial fibrillation with a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.
The patient was    instructed to monitor his INR and have his first INR check    on [**2198-9-6**], and to contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 57930**], telephone    number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 57931**], for Coumadin and INR level    management.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Cerebrovascular accident.
Mitral valve degeneration.
Status post left ankle surgery.
