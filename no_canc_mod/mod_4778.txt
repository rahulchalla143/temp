This is consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, more likely hypertensive in etiology.
No significant subarachnoid or intraventricular hemorrhage is appreciated.
There is mass effect present with shift of the normally midline structures towards the left.
There is also left sided subfalcine herniation.
There is no hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right frontal lobe.
This most likely relates to hypertensive hemorrhage, as opposed to a ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was a 75 year old right handed male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, dementia with sudden onset left sided weakness, dysarthria.
Head CT demonstrated a large right intracerebral hemorrhage, centered around basal ganglia and putamen.
We felt this was likely secondary to hypertension.
Examination post intubation but off intubations showed clinical evidence of elevated intracranial pressure and brainstem compression.
On serial exams by neurology and ICU attendings in the morning on [**2117-10-12**], patient had no clinical signs of brainstem activity.
No corneal, gag, oculocephalic, and oculovestibular reflexes were elicited.
At this point, patient was felt to have clinical signs consistent with brain death.
Plans were made to proceed with apnea testing.
At approximately 06:00 on [**2117-10-13**], the patient became bradycardic.
He lapsed first into a junctional rhythm and then had very infrequent ventricular escape beats on telemetry.
