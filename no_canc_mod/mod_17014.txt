She presented to the ED for further evaluation of her symptoms.

There is thickening of the right minor fissure likely due to a small amount of fluid in the fissure.
The right posterior costophrenic sulcus is blunted consistent with a small pleural effusion.
[**9-7**] ECHO Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved left ventricular systolic function.
Mild valvular thickening with no signifcant stenosis or regurgitation.
[**9-21**] PA and lateral chest compared to [**9-14**] through [**9-18**]: A small amount of volume loss persists in the right upper lobe.
There is no good evidence of recurrent pneumonia.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
There is an unusual configuration to gas shadows in the upper abdominal midline, probably unusual displacement of the gastric antrum.
If patient has referable symptoms to abdominal pathology I would reevaluate with routine abdominal radiographs.
No pneumothorax.
She was pan-cultured, given a dose of antibiotics, and transferred to the MICU for presumed septic shock.
# Respiratory failure/Septic Shock: In the MICU she quickly went into severe hypoxic hypercarbic failure (7.26/59/63 on NRB) requiring intubation.
She became hypotensive, requiring transient pressors and a total of 13 liters net volume resuscitation.
By chest x-ray, her consolidation resolved quickly after 5 days (post-bronchoscopy for cultures), suggesting increased secretions were a major component of her pulmonary dysfunction.
She had a prolonged intubation ([**Date range (1) **]) with hypoxia during spontaneous breathing trials for many days.
She had an O2 requirement for 1-2 days on the floor that improved with incentive spirometry and walking with PT.
# Rhabdomyolysis Upon presentation in the MICU, her CK was 1297 with large blood and few RBCs in the urine suspicious for rhabdomyolysis.
# Atrial fibrillation The patient's MICU course was also complicated by atrial fibrillation for 3-4 days not properly rate controlled on metoprolol or diltiazem.
Echocardiography showed a normal heart with LVH and preserved EF (>55%).
In discussions with the cardiology consult service, it was felt that the transient risk factor for atrial fibrillation (septic shock) had resolved and that long-term anticoagulation would not be warranted.
She reported no palpitations at any point in her stay.
# Weakness Ms. [**Known lastname 1001**] was initially weak while recovering from her extesnive MICU course.
# Anemia She had a labile hematocrit during this admission, likely consistent with a dilutional effect from high volume resuscitation.
On discharge, she has borderline macrocytic anemia with near-appropriate reticulocyte production and Fe studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Hypertension Her blood pressure was titrated with IV beta-blocker in the MICU and switched oiver to PO beta-blocker once the patient was taking good POs.
ACE-I was D/Ced out of concern for renal toxicity while rhabdomyolysis resolving.
Outpt resumption of ACE-I can be considered for this hypertensive patient with diabetes mellitus.
#Hyperlipidemia Crestor was held durign this admission out of concern for potentially exacerbating rhabdomyolysis.

Discharge Instructions: You have been evaluated and treated for a severe pneumonia.
Your course was complicated by severe breathing difficutly requiring a breathing machine to temporarily support your breathing.
Also, there was evidence of temporary muscle breakdown that was resolving by the time of discharge.
During the most severe period of your illness, you developed a rapid irregular heartbeat.
If you develop any new or concerning symptom such as shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers to greater than 101F, or a fast irregular heartbeat; please seek medical attention as soon as possible.
