Admission Date:  [**2112-1-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2112-1-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2041-3-22**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old female, with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, who presented to her primary care physician's office on the morning of admission with dyspnea on exertion.
She reports having worsening shortness of breath for the past two years, and a year ago noticed that she had to stop mowing her lawn.
She reports also that her shortness of breath has worsened over the last month with minimal exertion.
She does not complain of any chest pain or palpitations, chest discomfort.
No nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.
An EKG done at her primary care physician's office was abnormal, and she was sent to [**Location (un) **] for a stress test.
She exercised for 2-3 minutes and stopped with shortness of breath and ST depressions in the inferior leads and lateral leads.
She was alert and responsive, in no apparent distress.
There was no JVD and no bruits.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI systolic crescendo murmur.
LUNGS:  Fine crackles at the left base.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm, with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Her chest x-ray showed prominent pulmonary vasculature.
Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with occasional PVCs and a right bundle branch.
It showed moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 43, a mean gradient of 27, and aortic valve area of 0.9 cm2.
She had no aortic regurgitation and mildly thickened mitral and aortic valve leaflets.
Left main to have a 70% distal stenosis.
Her LAD had minimal disease.
Left circumflex had minimal disease.
While awaiting surgery, she did receive a dental consult where she was cleared from a dental standpoint for possible aortic valve replacement.
The surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with a cardiopulmonary bypass time of 160 minutes, and a crossclamp time of 111 minutes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in normal sinus rhythm, and on Levophed and propofol drips, with two atrial and two ventricular pacing wires, and two mediastinal and one left pleural chest tube.
On the operative night, she was weaned to extubate, and extubated without difficulty.
Also, in the overnight period she was noted to have a low cardiac output and mixed venous gas, and she was started on milrinone and given fluid boluses.
Her chest tubes did remain in for increased drainage.
Later on in this day, she was noted to have frequent PVCs and was eventually started on an amiodarone drip.
She had her Lopressor increased and was to receive IV Lopressor should she have anymore bursts of atrial fibrillation.
By postoperative day #7, she was started on anticoagulation for her intermittent bursts of atrial fibrillation.
Also on postoperative day #7, she received a repeat cardiac echo to evaluate her ejection fraction, as she had had multiple PVCs and a couple of runs of nonsustained V. tach.
Therefore, she was started on Coumadin for anticoagulation, and continuing her heparin for anticoagulation of her atrial fibrillation.
She continued to receive Coumadin to achieve goal INR of 2 to 2.5, and she did continue to have intermittent, self-limited bursts of atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate in the 110s-120s.
She was continued on Lopressor and amiodarone, and by [**1-27**] had achieved goal anticoagulation, and it was felt that since her bursts of atrial fibrillation were self-limited, and she remained asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable, that it would be safe for her to be discharged to home with visiting nurse services.
EXTREMITIES:  Showed 1+ pitting edema in her bilateral lower extremities.
