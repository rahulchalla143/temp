HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 34-year-old Somalian man, who initially presented to the Emergency Department at an outside hospital in [**2135-1-15**], when he first noted scleral icterus.
At that time, the patient reportedly had no other symptoms; in particular, he had no abdominal pain, pruritus, or mental confusion.
Of note, however, he had noticed dark urine and [**Male First Name (un) 1658**]-colored stools for several days prior to his presentation to the outside hospital.
He was found to have nonobstructive jaundice with a total serum bilirubin of 18.
Serologies for the hepatitis A, B, and C viruses were negative; the patient was found to have a Coombs positive hemolytic anemia at that time.
A transjugular liver biopsy was attempted at the outside hospital, but the procedure was aborted when the patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation.
He was then discharged from the hospital on [**2135-1-30**] with a presumptive diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis versus a drug induced hypersensitivity hepatitis caused by khat.
He remained asymptomatic until [**2135-3-17**], when he began having nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Prior to this, the patient had noticed increasing jaundice over the preceding several weeks.
He was also found to have markedly elevated LFTs with an AST of 1586, ALT 927, total bilirubin greater than 45, direct bilirubin greater than 15, alkaline phosphatase 96, GGT 158, and then INR of 2.25.
A transjugular biopsy was performed on [**2135-3-18**]; the results demonstrated an acute hepatitis consistent with a drug hypersensitivity reaction, although autoimmune hepatitis could not be excluded.
There was no evidence of chronic liver disease on his biopsy.
An abdominal ultrasound done on the same day demonstrated a contracted gallbladder, but no evidence for acute cholecystitis or biliary obstruction.
Given his coagulopathy, the patient was administered fresh-frozen plasma and vitamin K with a subsequent decrease in his INR to 1.55.
On [**2135-3-19**], the patient had significant bright red blood per rectum with a drop in his hematocrit from 25 to 16.
A colonoscopy was reportedly deferred due to persistent melena.
Also at the time of these bleeding episodes, the patient developed acute renal failure with an increase in his creatinine from 1.0 to 3.3; he also had decreased urine output at this time.
Urine microscopy demonstrated muddy brown casts consistent with ATN versus bile acid induced injury.
Serial LFTs done at this time demonstrated improvement of his elevated serum immunotransferase levels while on the steroids, but his total serum bilirubin had risen to a level of 73.5.
With this medical picture, the patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at the [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2135-3-20**] in order to recent an evaluation for a possible liver transplant.
Also of note, his evaluation at the outside hospital prior to transfer included the following:  A slightly elevated alpha-1 antitrypsin level of 212, normal ceruloplasmin level, LKM negative, SMA 1:40, [**Doctor First Name **] was positive at 1:320, hepatitis A IgG was positive, but IgM was negative.
Coombs positive hemolytic anemia as detailed above.
Transient atrial fibrillation as detailed above.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On initial review of systems, the patient complained of fatigue, weakness, abdominal distention, and shortness of breath.
He denied pain, cough, chest pain, or palpitations.
He also denied any joint pains or cramps.
He had marked scleral icterus, and his mucous membranes were moist.
His heart was of regular, rate, and rhythm, there were normal S1, S2 heart sounds, and there were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The presence or absence of a fluid wave was not clearly detectable on initial physical examination.
He had 2+ dorsalis pedal pulses bilaterally, and there was no peripheral edema.
Gastrointestinal:  As noted above, the liver biopsy done at the outside hospital was more consistent with a drug hypersensitivity reaction than with autoimmune hepatitis.
As noted above, the patient's liver function tests were markedly elevated on admission.
Throughout the first week of his hospitalization, these liver function tests remained markedly elevated.
In addition, by hospital day three, the patient's amylase and lipase levels were found to be markedly elevated at 366 and 1,005 respectively.
The patient was tolerating a full diet, and his scleral icterus had diminished significantly.
Renal:  As noted above, the patient was found to be in acute renal failure on admission.
He also developed hyponatremia that was attributed to volume depletion that resulted from his persistent diarrhea (The patient was receiving high doses of lactulose in order to prevent hepatic encephalopathy), and intermittent nausea and vomiting.
Please note that during the time of his severe acute renal failure, the patient was started on Sevelamer as well as epoetin.
Although the etiology of the patient's acute renal failure remains somewhat unclear, it seems likely that he had a component of both ischemic ATN as well as a component of drug-induced nephropathy caused by khat.
His HSV-1 IgG was positive, but this was not thought to be contributing to his acute disease process.
Despite the fact that the patient did not have a positive Clostridium difficile toxin antibody, given his markedly elevated white blood cell count in concert with his diarrhea, the clinical diagnosis of Clostridium difficile colitis was made.
By the time of his discharge, the patient was afebrile and had no clear foci of infection on examination.
On hospital day three, the patient developed an acute episode of hypoxic respiratory failure that was thought to be due to volume overload.
He subsequently had no further pulmonary distress, and by the time of his transfer to the General Medicine floor on [**3-26**], he was breathing comfortably on room air.
Hematology:  Given his severe hepatitis, the patient was found to have a mild coagulopathy.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had intermittent episodes of a hyperdynamic precordium during his hospitalization.
He was intermittently tachycardic, most likely due to mild intervascular volume depletion.
Due to his hyperdynamic precordium, however, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on [**3-31**] to evaluate for the possibility of pulmonary hypertension.
This study did not demonstrate any evidence of pulmonary hypertension, and the patient's ejection fraction was found to be normal.
He did have any regional wall motion abnormalities.
Acute subfulimnant hepatitis, most likely due to drug hypersensitivity induced by khat.
Acute renal failure.
Blood loss anemia.
Presumed Clostridium difficile colitis.
Transient acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
He was instructed to go to the [**Location (un) 470**] of the [**Doctor Last Name 780**] Building on the morning of Tuesday, [**2135-4-12**] to have his blood drawn.
He was given a prescription for this appointment.
