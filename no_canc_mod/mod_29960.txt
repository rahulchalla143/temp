Admission Date:  [**2128-12-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-12-25**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfonamides  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**] Chief Complaint: Consulted by Neurosurgery for cerebellar hemorrhage   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old hx of Afib (on Coumadin), HTN, CHF, and hx of falls who presented yesterday with headache, nausea and vomiting (symptoms acutely developed at 5PM yesterday).
She is unable to provide a history, but notes indicate that she was at home with her home health aide when she developed a sudden headache and began vomiting.
There was no hx of recent trauma.
She was taken to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where a head CT revealed a cerebellar hemorrhage.
Her neurologic exam has remained stable and, as of this morning, was noted to have some confusion, left sided dysmetria, left lateral gaze palsy (left eye did not move past midline, right eye unable to fully adduct).
She was given hydralazine for elevated BP and shortly thereafter complained of dizziness and nausea.
She received Anzemet and Compazine with some relief and has become less restless later in the evening.
Currently, she is difficult to arouse and complains of "dizziness" and "feeling sleepy".
Past Medical History: Atrial fibrilliation ectopic atrial tachycardia AI MR HTN Diastolic dysfunction on old echo Depression Colitis Falls - uses walker at baseline   Social History: Lives with home health aide, who describes her as a vibrant woman with lots of friends.
Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: T-99.2 BP-137-160/51-72 HR-63-78 RR-15-22 O2Sat-91-98% Gen: Lying in bed, NAD HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit Back: No point tenderness or erythema CV: Irreg, S1/S2 +gallop Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: warm, well perfused .
Speech is fluent, does not cooperate with naming or repitition tasks.
No observed myoclonus or +postural tremor of UE bilaterally.
Lifts all extremities antigravity for at least 5 seconds, no obvious asymmetries .
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2128-12-18**]  6:00:12 PM Sinus rhythm Supraventricular extrasystoles Left axis deviation Left ventricular hypertrophy Nonspecific ST-T wave changes No change from previous .
IMAGING CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2128-12-18**] 5:59 PM FINDINGS: There is interval development of a large left cerebellar intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
There is possible extension into the fourth ventricle.
Multiple small areas of hypodensity near the caudate lobes bilaterally, and left subinsular regions are stable.
Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of large left cerebellar acute hemorrhage with possible extension into the fourth ventricle.
CT [**12-18**]: Large left cerebellar intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
There is possible extension into the fourth ventricle.
Multiple small areas of hypodensity near the caudate lobes bilaterally.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2128-12-19**] 10:26 AM FINDINGS: Again seen is a large left cerebellar hemorrhage which extends into the fourth ventricle, and is essentially unchanged compared to one day earlier.
The ventricles are stable in size with no hydrocephalus.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
Hypodensities are again seen within the periventricular white matter, as well as a focal hypodensity in the left basal ganglion consistent with a lacunar infarct.
There have been no other changes.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of left cerebellar hemorrhage extending into the fourth ventricle.
No hydrocephalus.
She also had an episode sudden headache and vomiting.
There have been no witnessed falls.
A head CT showed a large L cerebellar acute hemorrhage, with blood in the 4th ventricle, and mild mass effect on pons.
Her INR was upon admission was 3.3 and she was given Factor IX concentrate in ED, as well as Vit K. The etiology of her hemorrhage is likely to be due to hypertension though hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke, unwitnessed trauma, bleed into underlying mass, or amyloid (usually cortically based) are also possible.
She had decreased tone in her L-arm and leg, as well as ataxia.
Cardiology was consulted for adjustments, especially to help control her multifocal atrial tachycardia.
The patient had pulmonary edema related to her MAT.
An ECHO showed a dilated LA, LVEF 55%, mild MR and pulmonary hypertension.
She was not febrile or symptomatic.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
If you experience a severe headache, nausea, vomiting, double vision or unusual sleepiness, please seek medical attention.
