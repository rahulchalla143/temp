He was emergently brought to the outside hospital, where he was intubated because of declining alertness and mental status.
The patient was found to have a massive left frontotemporoparietal hemorrhage at the outside hospital and was given 4 units FFP, 10 mg of vitamin K, and 2 units of platelets stat.
Repeat head CT here confirmed a massive left frontotemporoparietal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, extending 3 mm over the midline to the right.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, known CAD, status post stent to the  left circumflex.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No carotid bruits.
Extremities showed no evidence of cyanosis, clubbing, or edema with 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulse.
On neurologic examination the patient was intubated and sedated, not responding to voice, responded to noxious stimulus of his trunk, lower extremities, and chest.
No flexor or extensor posturing.
On cranial nerve exam, the patient had conjugate eyes and primary gaze; right pupil 4 mm fixed, left pupil 2.5 mm minimally reactive.
Doll's eye, corneals, and gag reflexes were intact.
No facial asymmetry.
No adventitious movements.
As dictated before, there was a massive parenchymal hemorrhage in the left hemisphere with dissection into the left ventricular system with displacement of normally midline structures from left to right.
There was blood in the fourth ventricle, which at the time of the CT was not especially dilated.
The patient's neurologic exam remained unchanged until the time of his death, and the patient was pronounced on [**2185-6-22**], at 2:20 p.m.  At that time, the patient did not respond to sternal rub, with no breath sounds, no heart sounds, and no pulses.
