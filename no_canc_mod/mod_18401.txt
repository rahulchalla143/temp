Admission Date:  [**2122-7-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-7-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2042-6-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Advair Diskus / Verapamil / Solu-Medrol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5123**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: This is an 80 year old woman with a history of COPD, CHF, AVR, [**Doctor First Name **] pneumonia, with a recent [**Hospital1 18**] admission for abdominal pain thought likely [**1-5**] gallstones, who now presents with AMS, SOB, and LE swelling.
Leg elevation did help with this, and a visiting nurse took measurements at home that suggested no major change in size of her LEs.
Her daughters began noting some confusion, difficulty with finding the right words sometimes, and she had at least one illusion or hallucination in which she thought someone was outside the window when they were not.
She seemed to have no fevers subjectively or by VNA measurements, though she did sometimes cough up sputum.
From a cardiology standpoint, she was considered low-risk, but pulmonary put her at a high risk for failure to wean from the vent based on a FVC of 1.4 and an FEV1 of 0.52; ultimately, with the resolution of her possible biliary symptoms, and these risks, surgery elected not to go forward with an operation.
COPD/Emphysema - Unclear disease extent, followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of [**Hospital1 1474**], currently managed on Symbicort and Atrovent.
Per [**Doctor Last Name **] consult note: "Patient suffers from a combination of bullous emphysema with lung changes from [**Doctor First Name **], as well, although disease has been stable for the past several years.
HTN 5.
Hyperlipidemia 6.
Hypothyroidism 7.
Father died at 81 of emphysema complicated by pneumonia.
Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals 97.9 65 133/58 18 96% RA General: NAD, lying in bed conversing with family HEENT: PERRL, moist mucous membranes, EOMI, upper and lower dentures, oropharynx clear NECK: supply, no JVD, no thyromegally, no carotid bruit.
LUNGS: Inspiratory crackles wheezes bilaterally, best heard at lung bases.
Good respiratory effort, using accessory muscles, decreased airlow CV: RRR, no murmurs, gallops or rubs ABD: Soft, NT/ND, + BS, no HSM Ext: 1+ pitting edema in bilateral LE to the ankle.
No cyanosis or clubbing.
Since the previous study, there has been no significant interval change.
There are again noted multifocal areas of cystic changes and fibrotic bands particularly in right upper lung fields.
Pleural thickening is seen at the lung apices bilaterally and also are stable.
Patient has severe emphysematous changes.
No large pleural effusions are seen.
[**2122-7-18**]: Head CT FINDINGS: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, masses, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles and sulci are moderately prominent, suggestive of age-appropriate involutionary changes.
There is bilateral periventricular white matter hypoattenuation, particularly in the frontal region suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic change.
There are basal ganglia calcifications in the right side.
There is no acute major vascular territorial infarct.
There is a left ethmoid osteoma.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with mild free wall hypokinesis.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old female with PMH significant for severe COPD (no home O2 at baseline), CHF with diastolic dysfunction (>55% EF), AVR in [**2119**], remote h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] pneumonia who was hospitalized for altered mental status, fatigue, dyspnea and bilateral lower extremity edema.
She was seen on [**2122-7-9**] for abdominal pain diagnosed as gallstone pancreatitis but was not deemed a surgical candidate due to previous history of prolonged extubation.
During this prior hospitalization, she was determined to be in acute renal failure and her PO lasix was discontinued.
# HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE - Pt came in with fatigue, altered mental status, and some dyspnea.
ABG of (7.28/88/217), showing an acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory acidosis.
PFTs on [**2122-7-13**] were consistent with severe obstructive disease.
She was started on azithromycin for possible COPD exacerbation, however due to low likelihood of this based on presentation, no steroids were started.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had an elevated BNP and on exam she had signs of right and left heart failure.
# CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE - Comes with chart diagnosis of known CHF, and elevated BNP (>11,000); prior echo does not point to the exact nature of this diagnosis.
At [**2122-7-9**] admission to the [**Hospital1 **] her home lasix was discontinued due to renal insufficiency and was not restarted.
Lower extremity edema markedly improved.
Upon discharge proBNP level 4804 with resolution of LE swelling and pulmonary edema.
#  ALTERED MENTAL STATUS - Most likely secondary to hypercarbia and consistent with daughter's descriptions of past behavior in this setting.
CT head was negative, reassuring given hx of word-finding difficulty.
# HYPERNATREMIA - Patient with elevated sodium after diuresis.
Could be due to combination of impaired access to free water, renal losses, insensible losses.
Renal was consulted day prior to discharge and felt laboratory and clinical picture was consistent with free water deficit.
Renal still thought this was likely to recovery from ATN.
#  RENAL INSUFFICIENCY - Recent bump of Cr in [**Month (only) 216**] with no clear source.
#  ANEMIA - Around her baseline of high 20s low 30s.
Anemia remained stable throughout the admission and required no acute managment.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM - Levothyroxine continued at home dose  # HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA - Continued home statin  # URINARY TRACT INFECTION - She was treated with Bactrim with a plan to complete a 7 day course for a UTI.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath, wheezing, long exhalation.
Congestive Heart Failure 2.
Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure 3.
Hypernatremia  Secondary Diagnosis: COPD Renal insufficiency   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for confusion, shortness of breath, and swollen legs.
You were also treated for hypernatremia (sodium elevation in blood.)
We started Bactrim 1 tablet by mouth once a day for next 5 days to treat a urinary tract infection.
If you experience worsening shortness of breath, fever > 102, chills, confusion, , please call Dr. [**Last Name (un) **] or go to an emergency room.
