HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54 year old woman with a history of hepatitis C status post interferon ribavirin treatment.
Patient had been diagnosed with hepatitis C screen for her new job as a medical office worker.
It is believed that she had acquired hepatitis C due to transfusions in the past.
Her initial evaluation was by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35720**] [**Name (STitle) 15844**] and at that time patient was upper quadrant pain, no nausea, vomiting, fever, chills or fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice or encephalopathy.
However, her viral load at that time was greater than one million particles.
Hepatitis C was genotyped 1B.
Liver biopsy at that time obtained on [**2122-8-13**], showed mild inflammation grade 2 and moderate hyperosis also grade 2.
During the course of her treatment patient developed numbness of her hands and erythema at the injection sites for interferon which began a week after therapy started.
She also developed low grade fever.
Patient also developed oral ulcers and brash plus continued anemia with hemoglobin dropping from 12 to 10 on admission.
Patient developed a rash on the face, arms, chest and back on and off with associated pruritus which was partially relieved by [**Doctor First Name **].
Oral lesions were controlled with triamcinolone ointment.
Patient also became hypothyroid during her therapy and has been on Synthroid since [**2123-1-22**].
For two weeks prior to admission on [**2123-7-15**], patient had worsening rash and worsening fever.
The fever had spiked approximately four times a day associated with chills and shakes.
Also had daily, watery, nonbloody diarrhea.
Patient took a leave of absence from work as a church administrator because of the fever the week before admission.
She had three bouts of post prandial vomiting which would occur approximately 45 minutes after each meal.
She also reports a 30 pound weight loss since she began ribavirin interferon treatment.
Patient notes that she does not take any herbal medications or over-the-counter medications.
ALLERGIES:  Patient notes a rash with wool contact.
Has two dogs, no cats.
No recent consumption of raw foods.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for mother with ovarian cancer and father with prostate cancer.
TRAVEL HISTORY:  Travel history is quite extensive.
Patient has been to [**Country 35721**] [**Country **] from [**2097**] to [**2099**] when she lived there with her first husband.
There was no scleral icterus.
No oral ulcers.
No thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.
Heart had normal S1, S2 and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Back had no CVA tenderness.
Skin was notable for a diffuse maculopapular rash on the head, face, shoulders and back, on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs.
There was no rash on the palms or the soles of the feet.
There were no finger nodules and no nail findings.
Urinalysis was negative for esterase and nitrites and otherwise normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  During [**Hospital 228**] hospital course the source of her rash and her fevers remained a mystery.
Gram stain was also negative for organisms.
Pathology of the skin biopsy was positive for leukocytoclastic vasculitis with dermal lymphoid eosinophilic infiltrate.
Immunofluorescence detected no IgG, IgA or IgM.
To rule out potential lymphoma patient's peripheral blood was sent off for flow cytometry.
This was sent off twice and both times there was no evidence of lymphoma or nonspecific reactive lymphoid profile.
The first time was notable for the presence of non-necrotizing granuloma occupying about 25% of the bone marrow.
Subsequent repeat bone marrow biopsy was notable for the absence of these granulomas.
Chest x-ray revealed some atelectasis, but no pneumonia or effusion.
CT abdomen revealed no abscess or fluid collection.
Some borderline retroperitoneal adenopathy.
CT of the chest was notable for pulmonary nodule in association with a minor fissure.
Radiology report indicated it may be a granuloma versus an intrapulmonary lymph node.
Ultrasound of the upper quadrants revealed nonspecific gallbladder distension, minimal pericholecystic fluid, 4.8 cm gallbladder with no stones or ductal dilatation.
MRA of the chest was done and revealed no evidence of vasculitis, therefore ruling against PAN.
During patient's hospitalization, unfortunately, she developed a DIC-like picture.
However, her symptoms did improve on high dose steroids.
By the time of discharge on [**2123-8-3**], patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia had stabilized.
Patient no longer required platelets or FFP transfusions or RBC transfusions.
Patient had noted some difficulty writing and the medical team noted that she had some difficulty with fine motor actions including touching finger to nose.
Neurology consult noted that patient had some muscular weakness including difficulty rising from a chair and unsteady gait.
However, they noted that the patient had asterixis which suggested to them that patient's condition was metabolic in nature.
Patient's serum ammonia level was found to be elevated so patient was put on a low protein diet.
Lactulose was considered, but given patient's diarrhea at this time and also loss of electrolytes through her diarrhea, lactulose was held.
Th etiology of her illness was felt to be a sarcoid like reaction to the IFN with systemic granulomatous reaction.
