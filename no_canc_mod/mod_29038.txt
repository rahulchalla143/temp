He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59664**] on [**2102-10-26**] for evaluation of mental status changes including gait and balance, which had been getting progressively worse over the last six months.
He also noted diplopia for nearly a year without any ophthalmological etiology.
He brought multiple studies (MRI/CT) for evaluation, and it was determined that evacuation of the SDH would provide the best chance at possibly allieviating symptoms given the enlarging size of the hematoma.
Past Medical History: Parkinson's disease, with nighttime hallucinations L subdural hemorrhage Hyperlipidemia   Social History: married, lives at home   Family History: not obtained  Physical Exam: [**2103-1-5**] Vitals: 97.5, BP 146/78, HR 73, RR 22, OT Sat 92%, FS 128, I:2290(24h) O:4050(24h) General: NAD Wounds: C/D/I Neuro Exam: -eyes open to voice -PERRLA (2mm-1mm) -Motor: Upper extremities localize bilaterally to painful stimuli         Lower extremities withdraw bilaterally to painful stimuli         Facial grimmace with painful stimuli   Pertinent Results: [**2103-1-5**] 06:00AM BLOOD WBC-10.8 RBC-3.39* Hgb-10.1* Hct-29.6* MCV-87 MCH-29.9 MCHC-34.2 RDW-12.2 Plt Ct-524* [**2103-1-5**] 06:00AM BLOOD Plt Ct-524* [**2103-1-5**] 06:00AM BLOOD PT-13.7* PTT-26.4 INR(PT)-1.2* [**2103-1-5**] 06:00AM BLOOD Glucose-129* UreaN-24* Creat-1.1 Na-137 K-4.9 Cl-102 HCO3-28 AnGap-12 [**2102-12-24**] 03:38AM BLOOD ALT-83* AST-147* LD(LDH)-185 AlkPhos-94 TotBili-0.2 [**2103-1-5**] 06:00AM BLOOD Calcium-8.5 Phos-3.8 Mg-2.3   Brief Hospital Course: Patient electively admitted on [**2102-12-18**] for evacuation of chronic left subdural hematoma complicated by subarachnoid hemmorhage.
[**2102-12-20**]: EEG performed: IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background rhythm and due to the prominent focal sharp waves in the left fronto-temporal region and, less frequently, in the right frontal area.
A slow background indicates a widespread encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
This should not come from a subdural hematoma alone in most cases.
There were very frequent sharp waves, mostly in the left anterior quadrant (and occasionally right frontally), but there were no repetitive discharges to indicate ongoing seizures at the time.
Finally, there was no prominent voltage asymmetry [**2102-12-21**]: IV antibiotics started secondary to gram negative rods in the sputum.
There is a persistent left-sided subdural collection causing mass effect upon the left cerebral hemisphere and 6 mm midline shift, which is unchanged.
Persistent widespread subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Pulmonary edema with superimposed right middle lobe/right lower lobe infection and/or aspiration.
Left retrocardiac atelectasis, however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Compared to the prior CT, there is slight increased size of the left-sided subdural CSF intensity collection with midline shift which has slightly increased with subfalcine herniation.
Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and hemorrhagic contusions are again identified without new hemorrhage.
No definite aneurysm is identified but the vascular structures are less distinctly visualized which could be due to mild non-occlusive spasm.
Proximal basilar artery demonstrates narrowing which could be due to stenosis as described previously.
