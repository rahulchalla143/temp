Pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions are again demonstrated.
Compared with the previous study, the right pleural effusion has probably decreased somewhat.
IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in pleural fluid on the right.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Severe mitral annular calcification.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Moderate to severe (3+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
The left atrium is moderately dilated and elongated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.9 cm2).
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Based on mean mitral valve gradients of [**7-26**], there is likely at least moderate mitral stenosis.
Moderate to severe (3+) eccentric mitral regurgitation is seen, with a coanda wrapping to the posterior wall of the left atrium.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Septal wall motion is consistent with av pacing.
Mitral regurgitation appears mild to moderte, mitral stenosis is unchanged.
There is a bioprosthetic arotic valve insitu.
There is no Aortic insuffiency or stenosis.
There is no perivalvular leak.
She was cultured for a white count of 25, no growth to date, cxr showed small bilat effusions.
She had several episodes of rate controlled atrial fibrillation for which she was anticoagulated with coumadin and started on amiodarone/metoprolol.
