On admission labs he was found to have a leukocytosis to 13.4 and was febrile to 102.
He also had an elevated bilirubin to 6.8, a mild transaminitis, and was noted to be in renal failure with a cr up to 4.1 He underwent MRCP as there was concern for cholangitis in the setting of fevers, jaundice and abdominal pain.
Initially the MRCP was read as negative, however, when the gastroenterologist and surgeon re-evaluated it they had higher suspicion for CBD dilation with a small CBD stone.
Past Medical History: HTN Abdominal hernia repair TIA Bilateral TAH CKD with b/l Cr 1.3-1.6  Social History: No ETOH, smoking, or drug use.
These demonstrate multiple filling defects in the distal common bile duct, consistent with choledocholithiasis.
Intrahepatic bile ducts appear normal.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 y/o M admitted with acute cholangitis s/p ERCP with removal of stones and sludge.
# Acute cholangitis/Sepsis  Patient was febrile to 103 at outside hospital and transiently hypotensive, sys bp 78, with 4/4 blood cultures growing E.coli which was sensitive to ampicillin.
# Respiratory  Patient was intubated prior to ERCP, he was unable to be extubated secondary to pulmonary edema, altered mental status thought to be due to uremia and sedating medications.
Patient developed VAP due to prolonged intubation.
He was successfully extubated without complication once mental status improved and he underwent ultrafiltration for fluid removal improving his pulmonary edema.
# Acute renal failure  Baseline creatinine 1.3-1.6; Creatinine trended upwards thought to be due to ATN in setting of sepsis and hypotension.
Patient's mental status became altered secondary to uremia.
Patient was started on lanthanum, sevelamer and aluminum hydroxide for elevated phosphorus of 9.
# Atrial fibrillation  Patient developed atrial fib with RVR to 180s post ERCP which required amiodarone gtt and transition to oral regimen.
This was new in the setting of sepsis and stress response.
He was not placed on anticoagulation given he was back in sinus and this was transient atrial fibrillation related to an acute process.
# Anemia  Patient hematocrit was noted to trend down.
Iron studies demonstrated iron deficiency as well as anemia of chronic disease.
# Hypertension  Currently on lopressor and well controlled.
Actually drops with dialysis and so midodrine started for prior to dialysis.
Short term memory loss.
CT of head without acute changes.
# Congestive Heart Failure, systolic, left: Echo done during sepsis with LV hypokinesis, EF 40%, mildly improved on day of discharge.
Medications on Admission: Triamterene/HCTZ Ferrous sulfate 325mg daily ASA 325mg daily   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: cholangitis cholelithiasis sepsis acute renal failure left ventricular dysfunction - systolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Continue dialysis, continue physical therapy.
