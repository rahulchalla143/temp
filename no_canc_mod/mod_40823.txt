Review of his [**Location (un) 2274**] notes confirm this (stays on [**11-2**]), and describe chronic worsening of his dyspnea on exertion.
Workup in the past has included TTE (EF 55-60%, moderate-severe AI, severe posteriorly-directed MR, and severe pulmonary HTN), Chest CT (c/w interstitial lung disease).
On his admission to OSH, there was concern for need for MVR workup.
He described his symptoms as the sensation that he was not getting enough air.
He reported that his symptoms would often improve with morphine.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: - Diabetes, - Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - Severe mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hyptertension (no reports available) 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Lupus - ESRD on HD (Tues/Thurs/Saturday) - GERD  Social History: Lives with 6 year old son in [**Name (NI) 1474**].
Family History: Several family members w autoimmune disorders.
GENERAL: NAD, comfortable HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP clear NECK: Supple, no JVD CARDIAC: RRR, III/VI holosystolic murmur, loudest at apex, LUNGS: Resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use, Dry crackles b/l bases ABDOMEN: Soft, NT/ND.
ECHO [**10-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable thinning and hypokinesis of the basal inferior segment.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**11-28**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is moderate cardiomegaly with mildpulmonary edema.
In addition, relatively extensive bilateral areas of opacities are seen that could be atelectatic, but could also represent pneumonia.
Nopleural effusions.
A double-lumen left-sided central venous access line.
Brief Hospital Course: # Shortness of Breath - Patient w chronic worsening of shortness of breath, thought to be [**12-29**] mitral regurgitation; patient denying any chest pain.
EKG not consistent with ischemic origin; no signs to suggest infection on history, imaging, labs; does not appear to be acute worsening of MR, but more slow progression.
Ground glass appearance on chest CT and bilat pleural effusions may be suggestive of interstitial lung disease and may be somewhat responsible for DOE.
Also, pt has hx of OSA and not currently using CPAP which may be causing moderate pulmonary hypertension seen on ECHO.
# Lupus: pt states he is in a flare but able to ambulate with a cane and no increase in pain medicines needed.
# ESRD on HD: Scheduled Tues/Thurs/Sat.
Unclear if more aggressive fluid removal in HD has helped his SOB.
# HTN: BP well controlled at present on atenolol.
# Insomnia / Anxiety; Trazadone and lorazepam were continued at home doses.
Pt was counseled to continue care at [**Location (un) 2274**] and seek referrals for rheumatology and pulmonology within that system.
PCP will arrange [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u with pulmonology to evaluate sleep apnea and pulmonary hypertension 4.

10. trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Mitral Valve Disease Lupus Chronic Diastolic Congestive heart failure Hypertension End stage renal disease.
Discharge Instructions: You were having trouble breathing and was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] to be evaluated by cardiac surgery for a potential valve replacement or repair.
You will need to see a lung doctor (pulmonologist) before surgery to see if your breathing difficulties may be because of lung issues in addition to your heart valves.
