Admission Date:  [**2114-7-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-8-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-12-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**] Chief Complaint: scrotal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: scrotal abscess I&D [**2114-7-26**]  History of Present Illness: This is a 47 yo M with history of DM, MI (s/p BMS to RCA [**12/2113**]), PE (on coumadin) who presented from [**Hospital **] Hospital ER with with 1.5 weeks of increased left scrotal swelling and pain at the base of the scrotum worse over the day prior to presentation.
He has a 5-year history of 12 abscesses which have drained spontaneously.
At [**Hospital1 **], he had a testicular ultrasound with moderate bilateral scrotal swelling without testicular abnormalities noted and then a CT scan that showed scrotal cellulitis and a left scrotal abscess.
Labs were notable for a leukocytosis to 15K and he was given Vancomycin, Piperacillin-Tazobactam, and Clindamycin.
He was seem by urology and noted to have the abscess draining through a tract towards the left perirectal part of the left hemiscroton and I&D done with 300 cc of "maroon,bloody, foul-smelling pus" which was sent for culture.
Urology felt this was more consistent with abscess and not suggestive of Fournier's gangrene.
There was immediate pain relief with drainage of the abscess and the wound was packed.
Given his recent hypotension he was triaged to the MICU for  sepsis.
On the floor, he denied recent fevers and endorsed scrotal pain.
He had mild dyspnea, which he has had previously and relates to COPD.

WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2114-7-30**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Susceptibility will be performed on P.aeruginosa and       S.aureus if sparse growth or greater..       DR [**First Name (STitle) **] BRUSH ([**Numeric Identifier 29614**]) REQUESTED SPECIATION OF ORGANISMS [**7-28**].

ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final [**2114-7-30**]):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2114-8-2**]):    NO GROWTH.
TTE [**7-26**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF = 75%).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: dilated, hypocontractile right ventricle with at least moderate pulmonary hypertension; small, hyperdynamic left ventricle .
[**7-26**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: No deep venous thrombosis involving the right or left lower extremity.
[**7-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: An ill-defined opacity at the left lung base, likely atelectasis, could be related to a bulge to the left mediastinal contour just inferior to the aortic knob could be a left hilar or mediastinal mass or, less likely aneurysm of the descending aorta.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Mild septal thickening predominantly in the lung apices, consistent with mild volume overload.
Scattered symmetric mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes measuring up to 11 mm.
Findings may be reactive secondary to mild pulmonary vascular congestion; however, the differential is broad and continues to include inflammatory and neoplastic etiologies.
Mild centrilobular emphysema, predominantly at the lung apices.
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Admission: This is a 47 yo M with history of DM, CAD/MI, PE on coumadin, presenting with scrotal abscess and fever admitted to the ICU after drainage of his abscess then downgraded to floor for discharge pending improvement in scrotal swelling.
Active Problems:  1) Sepsis from scrotal abscess: Patient presented with septic physiology that improved in the setting of receiving broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam) and and having abscess drained by urology.
Unclear what portal of entry was but given history of folliculitis in area possible this evolved into cellulitis.
As of his second hospital day the patient began to manifest considerable improvement in his septic physiology in the context of antibiotic treatment.
Cultures were obtained and grew out multiple bacteria as detailed in results.
2) Presumed Chronic Right Ventricular Failure: The patient had persistent mild hypoxia in the ICU, sinus tachycardia, and echo showing RV dilation and hypokinesis.
This raised concern of acute PE (though he was supratherapeutic on coumadin at presentation).
CTA without PE though did show emphysema, which along with his OSA and recurrent previous PE's are probably the etiology of his RV failure.
Persistent sinus tach thought due to right ventricle being unable to augment output without tachycardia.
4)  History of pulmonary embolism: Given INR of 12 at presentation and surgery his coumadin was held until INR hit 2.5 at which time it was restarted at half dose (5 mg per day).
At time of discharge INR was 1.2 and the patient was bridged with Lovenox with instructions to f/u his INR with PCP.
Chronic Problems:  5) Hypoxia: The patient remained mildly hypoxic over the first few days in the hospital with primary etiology thought to be his COPD and fluid shifts.
7) CAD: He had no signs or symptoms of ACS.
He had two sets of cardiac enzymes that were negative for signs of infarction.
