Admission Date:  [**2154-3-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-4-8**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6195**] Chief Complaint: Hip fracture  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Open reduction/internal fixation [**3-24**]  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with COPD on 2L O2 at baseline, who presented s/p fall on [**3-22**] onto her R side when going from chair to walker.
She denies any LOC or head injury at the time, and fall was purely mechanical.
She was seen by cardiology for pre-op evaluation; she has no known history of CAD, but does have very low functional capacity.
Anxiety Anemia (33.6 on admission here, unclear etiology, no outside records).
Pertinent Results: CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a complex intertrochanteric fracture through the right femur.
There is soft tissue edema in the region surrounding the fracture.
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT KNEE WITH ONE ADDITIONAL VIEW OF THE RIGHT LEG: There is no evidence of acute fracture.
No definite knee effusion identified.
EKG [**3-23**]: Sinus rhythm First degree A-V block Probable septal infarct - age undetermined Possible left atrial enlargement No previous tracing  CXR [**3-23**]:  AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: IMPRESSION: 1.
Abnormal contour at the left paraspinal region near the diaphragm that cannot be entirely separated from the aorta.
This may represent an atypically laterally positioned hiatal hernia, but saccular aortic aneurysm is not excluded.
No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or overt CHF.
First degree atrio-ventricular conduction delay.
Possible inferior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2154-3-23**] multiple abnormalities as previously noted persist without major change.
Evidence for impaction at the fracture line, with backing out of the screw, as described.
No hardware loosening.
CT HEAD [**3-26**]:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or infarct on this limited study.
MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive to evaluate for an acute infarct.
This is associated with a probable hiatal hernia.
Given the history of aspiration, evaluation by upper GI series may be useful after evacuation of the debris within the esophagus for further characterization of the anatomic course of the esophagus and stomach.
Multiple pulmonary opacities primarily peripherally.
Coronary artery and aortic calcifications.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate MAC and thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

Her oxygen requirement was also slightly above baseline at 3L.
However, while on ortho service, cardiology was called and a rule out MI was performed, with negative cardiac enzymes.
Her brief post-operative tachycardia was likely related to her anemia, anxiety, and post-operative state with pain.
It is felt that her brief hypoxia was likely related to mild fluid overload from IVF received in surgery and PRBCs, as well as an underlying aspiration pneumonia (see below).
She was given atrovent NEBs intermittently as well for her COPD.
Levaquin started [**3-25**] for a planned 5 day course, however the course was lengthened to treat for her aspiration pneumonia as well.
5) Aspiration:  The patient was noted to have a mass just above the esophagus on CXR on admission, thought to possibly represent a left ventricular aneurysm.
A CT scan was done to better evaluate the mass, which demonstrated a dilated esophagus filled with food, as well as a likely hiatal hernia to explain the mass.
On further history the patient has had esophageal strictures in the past, and GI was therefore called to perform an EGD to further evaluate the possible hiatal hernia and dilate any strictures, however they could not advance the scope or remove any of the food particules during the EGD secondary to impacted food and reddened esophageal mucosa.
They recommended thoracics involvement, however the thoracic surgeons advised waiting 2 weeks to see if the food clears on its own rather than doing esophageal disimpaction secondary to the high risk of the procedure and necessity for general anesthesia.
She will also have a repeat swallow study at that time to see if the oropharyngeal component of her dysphagia has resolved.
She will be maintained on strict NPO until then, with aspiration precautions.
6) Aspiration pneumonia:  Multiple areas of consolidation were seen on her CT scan, consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
However she began to have increasing respiratory effort and hypoxia.
She was was transferred to the mICU on [**4-2**] for respiratory distress.
However she then became hypoxic again likely having pulm edema secondary to rapid afib.
Then the patient again became tachypnic and hypoxic.
