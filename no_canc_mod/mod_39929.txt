By report the patient had previously been well, but was feeling somewhat lethargic yesterday.
Reports that she developed DKA on multiple occasions in this setting.
Noted to be febrile to 102.6 and hypertensive to 226/12.
LP was performed, positive for leukocytosis and patient was given ceftriaxone, vancomycin, dexamethasone, and acyclovir to cover empirically for meningitis.
Upon arrival in the MICU, the patient is intubated and sedated with propofol, with EEG leads attached   Past Medical History: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus w/ h/o multiple episodes of DKA and poor compliance htn asthma hyperlipidemia fibroids cataracts adenomatous polyps   Social History: She is not married.
Her mom had a fatal MI at the age of 54.
No m/r/g LCA b/l +bs.
no rashes/skin breakdown.
No consolidation or effusion in the lung.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect.
The appearance of the brain is unchanged since the prior study, and there are multiple hypodensities in the basal ganglia representing chronic lacunar infarct.
There is mucosal thickening in ethmoid sinus and right maxillary sinus, with densely calcified cystic lesion as noted previously, now filled with secretions, not significantly changed from [**2148-2-28**].
This likely relates to chronic sinusitis.
Unchanged appearance of the brain without acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Densely calcified cystic lesion in the right maxillary sinus, now opacified with mucus.
Carotid US: Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis .
EEG [**12-22**]: ROUTINE TIME SAMPLING: Showed a very low voltage background with  occasional bursts of generalized slowing and some faster frequencies, also generalized.
There were no prominent focal features, and there were no epileptiform abnormalities.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed some artifact and occasional sharp features but no definite epileptiform abnormality.
They showed some minimally rhythmic slowing but no epileptiform activity.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The background rhythm remained supressed throughout, often correlated with use of substantially sedating medications.
There were no prominent focal features although encephalopathies and medication effect can obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic features.
Several areas of slow diffusion could be due to small subacute infarcts in the left cerebral hemisphere.
MRI/MRA Head [**12-24**]: FINDINGS: There is much more extensive restricted diffusion involving the cortex of the left cerebral hemisphere than on the study of three days previously.
There is extensive involvement of the frontal and parietal cortex with some involvement of the insula as well.
There is probably some medial occipital involvement as well suggesting PCA territory involvement.
There is also involvement of the deep left frontal white matter near the caudate nucleus, as seen previously.
There are several small areas of relatively increased signal in the right cerebral hemisphere, on the diffusion-weighted images, which might be artifactual.
Currently the FLAIR images show FLAIR hyperintensity in the involved cortex and white matter but no increased signal and subarachnoid hemorrhage to suggest increased protein.
As seen previously, there is an old left putaminal hemorrhage with associated hemosiderin.
There is old infarct in the left corona radiata.
There is no mass effect on the ventricular system or midline structures.
IMPRESSION:  There is extensive primarily cortical infarct within the left MCA territory.
The distal left internal carotid artery is widely patent.
The left PCA originates from the basilar artery and is symmetric with the right and normal in appearance.
There is some irregularity of the right MCA proximally and distally, which could be artifactual or perhaps related to mild atherosclerosis.
The opacification of the paranasal sinuses has improved slightly compared to the prior study.
IMPRESSION:  There is no evidence of intracranial left internal carotid artery or left MCA stenosis.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to extensive, severe apical hypokinesis with focal dyskinesis.
An apical thrombus was NOT seen but CANNOT be excluded with certainty on the basis of this study.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-9-8**], extensive apical akinesis is now present.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The left ventricular apex is severely hypokinetic with focal dyskinesis.
No apical thrombus seen .
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared to the images of [**2154-12-24**], the anterior and anteroseptal wall motion abnormalities were present ( though not mentioned in the last report)).
No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess or colitis.
Small amount of perihepatic ascites, without enhancing rim or other suspicious features.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, not significantly changed in appearance from prior study.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Mild mediastinal, axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy again noted.
Pancreatic calcifications, consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
was loaded on Dilantin IV initially, but had 15 seconds of asystole and hypotension with this, and so was loaded instead on Depakote.
She was monitored on bedside EEG x 2 days (see results above) which showed a suppressed rhythm with no assymetries or epileptiform discharges.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] was performed on [**12-21**] and showed some question of subtle areas of slow diffusion in the left cerebral hemisphere.
Carotid US showed no stenosis and pt.
has been in NSR on telemetry, but TTE showed new apical hypokinesis (no clot seen on TTE) .
She was extubated on [**12-23**] without incident and has had some upper airway secretions initially but has been stable from a respiratory standpoint recently.
Neuro (seizure/cva):  As above, the patient was noted to have a L-sided cerebral infarction on MRI.
The patient was transitioned from Depakote to Trileptal given concern for possible Coumadin/Depakote reaction, and was therapeutic on 600 [**Hospital1 **].
Given that the mechanism of her stroke was felt to most likely be cardioembolic from new apical hypokinesis it was felt that she would benefit from Coumadin in the short term.
She will likely need Coumadin for 2-3 months, while the risk for apical thrombus is highest, and then her Neurologist should consider stopping it given her co-morbidites with longterm Coumadin.
However, during her course she developed an increased inr largely related to profound vitamin K deficiency, she was discharged on daily lovenox as described below.
She had no further seizures during her course.
In collaboration with the hematology and neurology services, she will receive full-dose aspirin (325mg) for secondary stroke prophylaxis with regard to the LV apical akinesis.
Hct stabilized after transfusion, and EGD showed gastritis around the PEG site but no other pathology.
[**Last Name (un) **] consult decreased her insulin substantially, and an am cortisol level was sent to rule out adrenal insufficiency.
ID (fever of unknown origin):  On the floor the patient spiked a low grade fever, which was felt to be [**1-31**] aspiration pneumonia given right LL infiltrate on CXR and high risk for aspiration.
She was started on Levaquin on [**2154-12-31**] and changed to Ceftriaxone and Flagyl on [**1-3**] given concern for prolonged Qt on EKG on Levaquin.
She continued to spike fevers and CTX was changed to Flagyl.
CT Chest/Abd perfomed to r/o abcess or other source of infection and was negative.
Chest CT did not show evidence of PNA.
They felt that her continued fevers and increasing eosinophil count pointed to drug fever.
Eventally her fever resolved with the holding of abx and lasix, and her fever was attributed to drug fever as she had high peripheral eosinophilia.
She developed diarrhea, and while her cdiff remained negative she was empirically treated with flagyl.
As ultimately no source for an infection was found (including negative C. dif toxins A and B), all antibiotics were stopped and the patient remained afebrile until time of discharge.
PULM (tachypnea):  The patient has had periods of hyperventilation and apnea which are most likely central in origin, EEG obtained to r/o subclinical seizure activity and this showed encephalopathy, but no seizures.
This resolved and then appeared again, an abg showed mild respiratory alkalosis.
CV (elevated troponin/CHF): During the patient's course she developed elevated troponins on the floor.
Cards was consulted and felt that the elevated troponins were likely due to demand ischemia from her illness and anemia.
Her cardiovascular status remained stable, though later in her course she had periods of increased wob and respiratory distress which were attributed to mild chf.
An egd showed gastritis, and with a PPI and 2 units of blood her hematocrit remained stable.
Given her stroke, as above she had been receiving coumadin, and during her course developed elevated pt/ptt/inr.
Her vitamin K was repleted, and her coags eventually normalized.
After consulting neurology, it was decided to anticoagulate with 325mg aspirin daily for secondary stroke prevention.
Post diuresis this rose slightly, but once diuresis stopped this remained at baseline for a while.
Later in her course the patient developed severe diarrhea and her creatinine increased and her uop decreased.
Her urine lytes revealed a pre-renal etiology and she was given fluids aggressively (while closely watching her exam and oxygen sats given her chf).
Her course was further complicated by and episode of contrast induce nephropathy with resulting transient decrease in renal function.
