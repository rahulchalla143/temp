The cause of which is likely multifactorial including: Decreased PO intake, possibly worsening pulmonary hypertension, and changing [**Date Range 2286**] requirements.
Hypotension: He initially presented with hypotension of 82/49.
Of note the patient had a similar episode of hypotension several months ago that resolved with IVF.
His WBC has remained normal and he has had no fevers.
CXR did not show signs of pneumonia.
Bedside U/s in the ED demonstrated a large aortic aneurysm, which appears stable on CT scan, and unlikely to be cause of hypotension.
No signs of bleeding.
A TTE was performed to assess for cardiogenic cause of hypotension.
On [**2129-1-21**] his [**Date Range 2286**] was optimized to leave him with a slightly higher dry weight.
Hx of CAD: The patient does not have signs of active ischemia.
There were no EKG changes from a recent comparison.
Considering bifascicular block and risk for total heart block, should discuss with PCP.
Beta blockade continued to be held in setting of hypotension.
He does not have signs of heart failure on exam; however, the concern was raised for the possibility of it being a factor in his episodes of hypotension.
Eccentric bladder wall thickening, new from [**2127-6-7**] that needs to be correlated with U/A and cytology.
A bladder ultrasound considered.
