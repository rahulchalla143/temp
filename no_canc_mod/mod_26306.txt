The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal, with left ventricular prominence.
Both lungs are clear without consolidations or effusions.
The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures demonstrate several right posterior rib fractures.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**11-1**] Head CT NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage extending through the white matter of the left insula and the left thalamus, irregularly shaped, but measuring up to 6.0 cm in transverse dimension.
The degree of hemorrhage has worsened since the study of [**Hospital1 9191**].
The hemorrhage is impressing and narrowing the left lateral ventricle, with mild midline shift to the right.
No extra-axial fluid collections are noted.
IMPRESSION: Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the white matter of the left frontal lobe and thalamus has increased since the outside hospital study.
There is mild midline shift to the right.
Head CT [**11-2**]: Increase in the volume of intracerebral hemorrhage, accompanied by slight increase in mass effect, left to right midline shift, and blood within the left lateral ventricle.
There is a small amount of hypodensity surrounding the hemorrhage, compatible with an extruded serum.
Head CT [**11-3**], [**11-4**]:  Similar appearance of large cerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage.
No new hemorrhage identified.
Head CT [**11-13**]: Interval decrease in hemorrhage within the left frontal/temporal lobes and left thalamus with resolution of the intraventricular blood within the left lateral ventricle.
Stable minimal shift of rightward structures.
Differential for this includes infection and ischemia.
- Micronodule or tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] type appearance at both lung bases, right greater than left.
These may represent early atypical infection.
No free fluid or lymphadenopathy is seen in the pelvis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 72 yo LH woman with h/o labile BP and parkinsonism on a daily baby aspirin who presents from OSH with large left sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
DDx on the etiology for this hemorrhage includes: hypertensive bleed (esp given location), trauma (less likely by history), AVM/aneurysm, toxic, amyloid (less likely given subcortical location), tumor, sinus thrombosis (also less likely given location, unilateral).
Neuro - Untreated hypertension is the most likely etiology of Pt's hemorrhage.
Serial head CTs displayed mild worsening in hemorrhage and mass effect with worsening of mental status, requiring intubation.
Flaccid paralysis in R upper extremity.
CV - Ruled out for MI on admission.
Hypertension initially controlled with Nicardipine gtt.
Non-specific nodules noted on upper part of [**11-15**] abdominal CT, outpatient chest CT scheduled for follow up.
Had increase in LFTs on [**11-15**] (max ALT 291, AST 112) likely d/t Levofloxacin, which was d/c'd, LFTs now improving.
No liver pathology identified on [**11-15**] abdominal CT.  ID - Treated from [**11-7**] to [**11-12**] with Ciprol for E.coli UTI, changed to Levofloxacin on [**11-12**] in the setting of fever, incr WBC, sputum Cx + MSSA.
Afebrile with nl WBC at the time of discharge.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6-8H (every 6 to 8 hours) as needed for titrate to one soft bowel mvmt per day, may hold for loose stools or abdominal pain.
Discharge Instructions: Seek medical attention for somnolence, new weakness, numbness, sudden change in vision or hearing, headache, or for other concerns.
