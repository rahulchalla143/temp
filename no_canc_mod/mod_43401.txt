The patient additionally presented with hypernatremia with a sodium of 165 and in acute renal failure.
Per report the patient presented with three days of increasing wheezing and decrease in mental status.
The patient was initially seen in the Emergency Department, however, transfer to the Intensive Care Unit for noninvasive ventilation.
Her chest x-ray demonstrated low lung volume suggesting possible aspiration pneumonia.
She was transferred to the unit where she received fluid, nebulizer treatments, intravenous steroids, which were quickly tapered, antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia as well as a urinary tract infection.
Her cardiac enzymes were notable for a troponin leak of .1.
Congestive heart failure.
Recurrent urinary tract infections.
No prior history of intubations.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Lung examination clear anteriorly with scattered wheezes.
No rebound or guarding.
Extremities no edema or clubbing.
Chest x-ray notable for right lower lobe atelectasis and possible infiltrate.
At baseline the patient did get Lasix, however, during this hospitalization this medication was held in the setting of her hypernatremia and renal failure.
Cardiac:  The patient ahs a history of congestive heart failure, however, no recent echocardiogram on file.
Her chest x-ray was unrevealing for volume overload, however, did reveal possible infiltrate.
Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated during this hospitalization with the troponin peaking at 0.10, however, there was no electrocardiogram changes and no evidence of acute ischemic insult based on CK with MB fractions.
Acute renal failure:  The patient at baseline has a creatinine of 1.7.
She was given aggressive intravenous fluid hydration in the setting of dehydrated prerenal azotemia.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient had an nasogastric tube placed during this hospitalization to provide nutrition given her relative risk for aspiration as well as her decreased mental status.
Prophylaxis:  The patient had Pneumoboots as well as a PPI during this hospitalization.
for two more days and then no further need for Prednisone.
Acute renal failure.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Asthma exacerbation.
Urinary tract infection.
Additionally Lasix will need to be considered as an outpatient upon resolution of the patient's acute renal failure.
The patient should have electrolytes checked frequently until resolution of her acute renal failure.
