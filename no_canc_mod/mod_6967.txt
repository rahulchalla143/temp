Admission Date:  [**2139-5-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-5-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2091-1-21**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain at rest.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old male with significant history of coronary artery disease, status post anterior myocardial infarction in [**2133**] with residual ejection fraction 20%, status post left anterior descending stent at that time, status post ICD in [**2134**] for VT/syncope, status post PCI/stents to the left circumflex in [**2137**], status post catheterization in [**2138-7-12**] for chest pain which showed patent vessels and stent.
Approximately one week ago, patient started an exercise program with walking.
He experienced chest pressure after walking one fourth of a mile.
Today, patient had [**10-21**] chest pressure at rest, mildly relieved with nitroglycerin.
In approximately five hours, the patient was pain free.
He denies diaphoresis.
Of note, patient has intermittent shortness of breath at baseline.
Extensive coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction 20%.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother had a stroke in her 50s, negative for early coronary artery disease, negative for hypercoagulability.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, distant heart sounds, 1/6 systolic murmur.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with mild bilateral basilar crackles.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Electrocardiogram: Normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, interventricular conduction delay, normal QRS interval, right axis deviation, biphasic T in lead III, poor R wave progression.
Chest x-ray:  Mild congestive heart failure.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 48-year-old male with known coronary artery disease, status post multiple interventions admitted with chest pain at rest.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The left anterior descending artery had mild diffuse disease only.
The left circumflex artery had 60% Instent restenosis within the previously placed stent.
There was an incremental stenosis to 70% just distal to the stent and before a trifurcation of the vessel.
The right coronary artery had mild diffuse disease.
The planned left heart catheterization revealed severely elevated left heart filling pressures with a mean left ventricular diastolic pressure of 36 mmHg.
It was notable for severe pulmonary hypertension.
Based on elevated fillings pressures noted at cardiac catheterization, patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for PA catheter placement and guided therapy.
Subsequent PA catheter readings showed diminished cardiac output while patient was on >.......<.
Echocardiogram disclosed a markedly dilated left atrium and right atrium.
There was no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, regional wall motion abnormalities include anteroseptal akinesis and apical akinesis/dyskinesis.
There is no apical thrombus.
The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Result of the VQ scan were low likelihood of pulmonary embolus.
Patient will also undergo outpatient evaluation for obstructive sleep apnea.
Outpatient work-up of obstructive sleep apnea.
Single vessel coronary artery disease.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Elevated left heart filling pressures.
