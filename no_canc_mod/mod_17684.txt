HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 61-year-old male status post cadaveric liver transplant in [**2176-6-18**], status post transjugular liver biopsy on [**10-3**] which showed mild acute cellular rejection, pathology results finalized.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End-stage liver disease due to alcoholic cirrhosis, encephalopathy, varices, depression, gout, diverticulitis, status post colectomy, DVT.
He was in no acute distress.
Midline incision was noted on his abdomen with mild distention, nontender, positive bowel sounds.
He did have mild lower extremity edema.
He was sent for ultrasound of the liver, which demonstrated no focal liver lesions or ascites.
There was nonvisualization of the right hepatic artery.
It was noted though that the patient had a looped segment of extrahepatic artery which was noted on an angiogram on the previous day that demonstrated patent common right and left hepatic arteries.
On the angiogram, it was noted the patient had a mild stenosis with no significant pressure gradient at the proper hepatic artery level, that perhaps corresponded to the surgical anastomosis.
Of note, the patient was followed closely by social service while in the hospital for depression, and the patient's request for individual counseling.
