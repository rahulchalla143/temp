UA showed granular casts and bilirubin, trace leuks, [**3-6**] WBC (no nitrites or bacteria).

Diffuse echogenic liver, most consistent with fatty liver disease.
However, more serious forms of liver disease such as significant  cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Patent portal veins with appropriate directional flow and hepatic veins with no evidence of thrombosis.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Trace amount of perihepatic ascites.
A spot was not marked for paracentesis given the lack of fluid.
LIVER BIOPSY [**2117-9-2**]: 1)  Cirrhosis with prominent sinusoidal distribution of fibrosis (confirmed by trichrome stain) Stage 4 fibrosis.
2)  Moderate macrovesicular steatosis with associated prominent foci of ballooning degeneration, abundant intracytoplasmic hyalin and lobular neutrophils.
3)  Moderate canalicular and hepatocellular cholestasis.
4)  Iron stain shows minimal iron deposition within Kupffer cells.
Note:  The findings are consistent with a toxic metabolic injury with advanced fibrosis (cirrhosis).
Given body habitus and patient positioning, a site suitable for safe paracentesis could not be marked.
Brief Hospital Course: 30 yo M with severe EtOH hepatitis complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] and also with RLE cellulitis transferred from OSH for further evaluation of hepatitis.
# Hepatitis - Assumed to be EtOH related given patient's significant history of alcohol abuse.
Likely a component of fatty liver involvement as well.
A biopsy was eventually performed when liver function did not improve, and it was confirmed to be alcoholic hepatitis with underlying cirrhosis.
Though Mr. [**Known lastname 90453**] remained A+O and without any complaints, with his severe liver disease his prognosis is poor.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] agreed to be the contact for home hospice to discuss further complications of his liver disease as they arise.
# Cirrhosis - Abdominal ultrasound was performed which showed no mass lesions in the liver, but confirmed cirrhosis and a small amount of ascites.
He was initially treated with ceftriaxone empirically for SBP given his severe liver disease.
A second ultrasound was performed but a suitable area for paracentesis was not identified.
# Acute Kidney Injury - Assumed to be due to hepatorenal syndrome, though the diagnosis was unclear given his small amount of ascites and normal sodium.
It may also have been due to prerenal azotemia as Cr was as high as 2.4 at OSH.
# Leukocytosis - There was no evidence for an infection.
High WBC count was assumed to be related to steroids and severe hepatitis.
# RLE cellulitis: Puncture wound on foot with drainage and erythema concerning for cellulitis.
Also likely a chronic disease component given kidney function.

You also had an infection in your foot that we treated with antibiotics.
You were started on steroids and other medications to try to prevent worsening of your liver function.
You were evaluated by the surgery team who did not feel that you were a good candidate for a liver transplant.
# START ativan 1mg every 6 hours as needed for anxiety.
