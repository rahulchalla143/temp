HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post 2-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2125**] (left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery), and status post myocardial infarction times four with positive enzymes; however, the patient has declined cardiac catheterization each time.
He was seen in consultation at his pulmonologist's office on [**2137-4-30**] for evaluation of a cough for a 4-month duration.
The cough was characterized as constant, productive of thick yellowish sputum with no associated fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or diaphoresis.
On evaluation in the Pulmonary Clinic he was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and felt to be in congestive heart failure and transferred to [**Hospital3 3583**] for admission.
At [**Hospital3 3583**], the patient was noted to be normotensive with a blood pressure of 105/65, heart rate of 100 with ventricular ectopy, and a respiratory rate of 22 with unlabored breathing.
His electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia with ectopy, reactive airway disease, poor R wave progression, and with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.
Clinically, he was felt to be in congestive heart failure and volume overloaded and was admitted for management of his congestive heart failure and a viral pneumonia.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was positive for decreased oral intake, cough (as stated above), and a questionable history of chest pain that was intermittent and not exertional.
During catheterization, the patient was noted to be hypotensive, and thus started on a dopamine drip leading to a run of supraventricular tachycardia and eventual hypertension, necessitating initiation of nitroglycerin drip.
Upon arrival to the Coronary Care Unit the patient was noted to be very agitated and having labored breathing.
On telemetry, his rhythm was significant for transitions between supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter terminating in an unstable atrial fibrillation rhythm with a progressive drop in blood pressure.
These numbers further deteriorated to a central venous pressure of 23, pulmonary artery pressure of 73/39, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 40, a cardiac output of 2.6, a cardiac index of 1.28, systemic vascular resistance of 1600 (consistent with cardiogenic shock).
History of poor glycemic control.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2124**], coronary artery bypass graft in [**2125**], myocardial infarction times three since, and two positive stress tests with apparent report of fixed defects.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recently formerly diagnosed, not home oxygen.
Rhinocort nasal spray.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history positive for coronary artery disease and diabetes.
In general, the patient was an alert, agitated, white male lying in bed in mild distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Neck was soft and supple.
Heart revealed distant heart sounds.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs revealed distant breath sounds, rales at the bases from the sides.
Extremities revealed trace edema.
No calf tenderness or cords.
Right groin with an arteriovenous sheath in place, and no hematoma.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Cardiac catheterization with the following findings:  A right-dominant system revealing 3-vessel coronary artery disease; the left main coronary artery was normal, the left anterior descending artery was subtotally occluded after a large first diagonal, the left circumflex was subtotally occluded proximally with late filling of a large first obtuse marginal which collateralized at the posterior descending artery, the right coronary artery was occluded proximally, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery was occluded, and the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery could not be engaged because the left subclavian artery was occluded 3 cm distal to its origin, but seemed to be filling the distal left anterior descending artery via competitive flow on the native vessel.
IMPRESSION:  A 63-year-old male with coronary artery disease, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit in likely cardiogenic shock in the setting of multivessel and graft coronary artery disease.
The patient was not felt to be having an acute coronary syndrome and was maintained only on aspirin.
In addition, the patient was placed on a Lasix drip for diuresis in the setting of a markedly elevated wedge pressure.
However, the Lasix drip was discontinued on hospital day three secondary to hypotension.
An echocardiogram obtained on [**2137-5-2**] showed the left ventricular cavity to be dilated, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, right ventricular systolic function also appeared depressed, and ejection fraction was noted to be between 10% and 20%.
However, on hospital day four, the patient was noted to have an atrial tachycardia with likely Wenckebach phenomenon, and the decision was made to discontinue the amiodarone drip.
PULMONARY:  As above, the patient was noted to be in increasing respiratory distress and was intubated.
In addition, the patient was noted to have purulent sputum and was started empirically on Levaquin and Flagyl for a likely pneumonia.
In addition, blood cultures were notable for coagulase negative Staphylococcus in the anaerobic bottle.
The patient was noted to have a low-grade temperature and spiked to a temperature of 101.1 on hospital day three.
In addition, the patient was noted to have a mild leukocytosis with a high of 13.9.
Therefore, during the time frame which this dictation is commenting on, there were no active renal issues.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable, and there was no indication for transfusions.
However, the patient was noted to have elevated coagulation laboratories.
INR was noted to be 2.3 on hospital day four on no anticoagulation.
The etiology of this abnormal coagulation was thought to be secondary to hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided fluid overload.
ENDOCRINE:  As above, the patient had a history of diabetes with reportedly poor glycemic control.
