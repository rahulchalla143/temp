HEAD CT [**2-4**]: There is extensive multicompartmental intracranial hemorrhage.
There is right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
There is intraventricular extension with hemorrhage demonstrated layering in both occipital horns.
In addition, there is multifocal subarachnoid hemorrhage demonstrated within the right frontal and left frontoparietal regions.
Within these limitations, there is no evidence of mass effect or acute territorial infarction.
There is extensive periventricular hypodensity, most compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
Note is made of a benign osteoma within the left sphenoid sinus.
There is no acute fracture  CT C-SPINE 1.
Within these limitations, no gross fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel degenerative changes with grade 1 anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 vertebral body.
This predisposes the patient to spinal cord injury in setting of trauma, and MR can be obtained as clinically indicated.
Slightly suboptimal lateral lumbar spine radiograph with overlying external artifact; however, no obvious evidence of acute fracture or dislocation is seen.
Additionally, slight suboptimal evaluation of the upper thoracic vertebral bodies on the lateral view of the thoracic spine, although T1 through T3 are included on the C-spine CT.
Given the above, no definite evidence of acute fracture or dislocation; if clinical concern persists, suggest CT. 2.
Multilevel degenerative changes.
No change in extent or distribution of hemorrhage, primarily parenchymal in right frontal lobe, but also with small subarachnoid and intraventricular components.
No "spot sign," aneurysm or vascular occlusion.
Given the distribution of the hemorrhage (lobar with overlying subarachnoid blood, suggestive of associated pial vessel involvement), patient demographics, and prior imaging, amyloid angiopathy is the primary diagnostic consideration, with post-traumatic or hypertensive hemorrhage, less likely.
EEG [**2-6**] This EEG is markedly abnormal and gives evidence for a moderate diffuse encephalopathy along with right hemisphere periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges and occasional bilateral synchronous epileptiform discharges.
They did not appear to have a change in  clinical behavior associated with them and their association with clinical seizures needs clinical correlation.
EEG [**2-14**] This is an abnormal routine EEG due to focal slowing in the right frontal region suggestive of subcortical dysfunction in this region and consistent with patient's history of intraparenchymal  hemorrhage.
The background was also slow and disorganized suggestive of a moderate encephalopathy.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were seen during this recording.
LUE ULTRASOUND Partially occlusive left basilic vein thrombosis surrounding PICC line.
CXR [**2-14**] New small left-sided pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 88 yo F w/ h/o vascular dementia, HTN, possible TIA in [**2135**], traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in [**2134**] who presented to ED with decline in mental status.
In the ED, she was hypertensive with SBP up to 205 and started on nicardipine drip for BP control.
Imaging showed a multicompartmental intracranial hemorrhage, involving RIGHT frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage.
The most likely etiology is amyloid angiopathy or hypertension.
On the floor, the patient initially had poor mental status, barely arousable, with minimal following of commands, but no focal findings on exam.
