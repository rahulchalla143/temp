Admission Date:  [**2178-2-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2178-2-11**]   Service:  CORONARY CARE UNIT  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, breast cancer, status post XRT, who presented to [**Hospital3 1196**] on [**2178-2-2**] complaining of chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.
Her initial EKG in the setting of hypotension demonstrated deep ST depressions in the precordial leads, V2-V4, and she was found to be in complete heart block.
When she was in route to the [**Hospital6 2018**] she was found to have pulseless VT for which she was shocked in the ambulance and started on Amiodarone.
She was taken emergently to the catheterization suite where she was found to have elevated filling pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 30 and notably prominent V waves indicative of mitral regurgitation.
A left heart catheterization revealed a left dominant system with a small and diffusely diseased RCA, a total occlusion of the proximal left circumflex artery, and a 95% stenosis of the proximal LAD.
Coronary artery disease, as above.
She had a positive stress test in [**2159**] consistent with inferior ischemia.
Chronic venous insufficiency.
History of carotid artery bruits with a carotid ultrasound in [**2172**] demonstrating a less than 40% stenosis of the right carotid and less than 40% stenosis on the left.
Diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  She has a sensitivity to hydrochlorothiazide but there are no known drug allergies.
HEENT:  She had wide, fixed, dilated pupils bilaterally.
Chest:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, with no audible murmur.
Extremities:  No edema.
Her lines upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit included a right IJ Cordis, left femoral artery intra-aortic balloon pump and a right femoral venous Swan line, all of which were competent.
EKG post procedure revealed normal sinus rhythm at 91 beats per minute with an indeterminate axis and a QTC of 476, QRS duration 150, right bundle branch block with ST depressions in V2 to V4 of 3 mm consistent with a posterior MI.
Chest x-ray:  ET tube 1.8 cm from the carina with an OG tube in the distal esophagus but no cardiopulmonary process.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The initial impression on admission was that the patient was an 85-year-old female transferred from an outside hospital with an acute posterior MI and cardiogenic shock precipitating complete heart block in the setting of an occluded dominant left circumflex artery.
The patient transferred to the CCU intubated on a balloon pump requiring dopamine for hemodynamic support.
A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated residual ejection fraction of 30% with overall LV systolic function moderately to severely depressed with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the inferior free wall, posterior wall, and lateral wall, as well as moderate 2+ aortic regurgitation and mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Her post revascularization course was also notable for an Enterococcus urinary tract infection for which she was treated with vancomycin.
She was also found to develop a pneumonia for which she was started on Levaquin.
She did have some persistent symptoms of congestive heart failure for which she was started on a standing dose of diuretic and required titration up of this.
12 hours for DVT prophylaxis, to be discontinued when the patient is tolerating acceptable level of activity.
Coronary artery disease, status post acute posterior myocardial infarction.
Status post cardiac catheterization with percutaneous coronary intervention of the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries with stent placement.
Right lower lobe pneumonia.
Enterococcus urinary tract infection.
Diabetes mellitus.
