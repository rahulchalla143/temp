Admission Date:  [**2138-9-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2138-9-25**]   Service:  C-MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Dr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, asthma, and chronic renal insufficiency, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] from [**Hospital3 **] following an episode of respiratory distress.
Four days prior to admission the patient had fallen at home and was taken to [**Hospital1 **] where hip films indicated no fracture.
On the morning of admission, the patient became confused, anxious, and dyspneic with a respiratory rate in the 40s, and oxygen saturation dropping to 70% on 2 liters; this improved to 95% on a 40% face mask.
Electrocardiogram indicated atrial flutter at a rate of 110.
Coronary artery disease, status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2116**]; catheterization in [**2124**] with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery; catheterization in [**2130**] with left main stenting, and multiple cardiac catheterizations in [**2131**] including a left anterior descending rotablation and stent.
Asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with restrictive pulmonary function tests and on home oxygen.
Pericarditis in [**2135**].
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.8.
Congestive heart failure, 35% ejection fraction.
Atrial fibrillation, chronic.
Aortic insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired ophthalmologist from [**State 350**] Eye & Ear Infirmary.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was a somnolent and arousable elderly gentleman, slightly agitated, in no acute distress.
He was afebrile with a heart rate of 72, respiratory rate of 24, blood pressure of 170/58, oxygen saturation 95% on 2.5 liters.
The patient had a right subconjunctival hemorrhage.
The neck was supple with no jugular venous distention.
The chest indicated reduced breath sounds at the bases.
No wheezes, rhonchi or rales.
A [**1-4**] decrescendo diastolic murmur at the right upper sternal border and a soft systolic murmur at the apex.
The abdomen was soft, with mild diffuse tenderness, without guarding or rebound.
There were normal abdominal bowel sounds, and no hepatosplenomegaly.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
He had a positive oculocephalic gag and corneal reflexes, was moving all four extremities.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray indicated stable mediastinal widening and aortic root dilatation with a tracheal shift to the right which was old.
There were small bilateral pleural effusions that were unchanged.
Electrocardiogram #1 indicated atrial flutter at a rate of 111 with 2:1 conduction, left axis deviation, left ventricular hypertrophy, Q waves in leads III and aVF, ST depressions in V4 through V6, and a T wave inversion in I and aVL.
Electrocardiogram #2 indicated a rate of 72, continued atrial flutter with persistent electrocardiogram changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted to the C-MED Service for rule out of myocardial infarction as well as for management of altered mental status.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
An echocardiogram indicated mild left ventricular hypertrophy, moderately decreased left ventricular function, 2+ aortic regurgitation, and 1+ mitral regurgitation, 4+ tricuspid regurgitation, as well as severe cor pulmonale and severe pulmonary hypertension.
Per Infectious Disease recommendations, the patient had a lumbar puncture which indicated 45 white blood cells in tube #1, 28 white blood cells in tube #4, and elevated protein at 67, normal opening pressure, and normal glucose.
A VVV PCR from the patient's cerebrospinal fluid was sent for analysis and was still pending at the time of the patient's demise; however, ultimately, the VVV PCR was read as negative.
An MRI of the head indicated moderate atrophy, small vessel disease.
No evidence of meningoencephalitis.
No hematoma or mass effect.
Serial blood gases indicated PCO2 in the 70s to 80s; however, this did not always correlate with the patient's mental status.
Each time the patient was returned to the floor with some improvement in mental status as well as in PCO2; however, again, the patient would revert to a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status with elevated PCO2.
The patient was also started on levofloxacin and Flagyl to treat possible aspiration pneumonia; although, a sputum culture ended up being negative, and the Infectious Disease consultation did not think the patient had a pneumonia, and these antibiotics were subsequently discontinued.
OPHTHALMOLOGY:  The patient was seen by the Ophthalmology consultation service and was determined not to have zoster ophthalmicus.
NEUROLOGY:  The patient had a head CT on the date of admission which was negative for mass lesion or bleed.
A metabolic workup was initiated which was negative with the exception of an elevated PCO2, which again did not seem to correlate with the patient's mental status.
Initially, it was thought that the patient's altered mental status might be secondary to Tylenol No.
3 and Ambien which he had received at [**Hospital3 1761**]; however, during his course at [**Hospital1 **] the patient received no benzodiazepines or other sedating medication, and his mental status continued to wax and wane.
On hospital day 16, the patient was noted to develop hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s as well as bradycardia.
He was continued on nasal CPAP; however, two hours prior to the initial finding of hypotension and bradycardia, the patient expired at 1 o'clock in the morning of [**2138-9-25**].
Viral encephalitis.
Coronary artery disease.
Renal insufficiency.
Congestive heart failure.
