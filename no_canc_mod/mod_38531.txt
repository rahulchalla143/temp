Per report, the patient complained of transient chest pain as well.
A nitroglycerin drip and lasix was given after her BNP came back at 40,000 and the chest x-ray showed an large right effusion and findings consistent with CHF.
An EKG was done which showed T wave inversions in the anteroseptal leads.
The patient gives a history of worsening SOB at night with associated palpitations over the past few weeks.
She denies fever, however, has had an occasional non-productive cough.
She denied CP in ED but was confused per her son's assessment.

Bibasilar atelectasis.
2) Mild cardiac failure.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 year old Russian speaking female with a PMH significant for atrial fibrillation, CRI, Type II DM and recent pneumonia [**10-25**] who presents with respiratory distress.
An EKG was done which showed T wave inversions in the anteroseptal leads.
1) CHF exacerbation thought to be etiology of respiratory distress.
Her respiratory status was stable with prn diuresis (~ 20 mg of po Lasix daily).
An echo revealed moderate global LV hypokinesis with an EF of 30-35%.
It was not increased further secondary to an increase in her Cr from baseline (up to 1.7 on day of discharge).
Pt was found to have new T wave inversions and mildly elevated troponin (likely secondary to CRI) which remained flat.
She was ruled out for MI with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes.
As [**Name6 (MD) **] the RN at [**Hospital3 2558**] she has a h/o angina requiring PRN SL NTG.
Cr slightly elevated above baseline thought to be secondary to addition of ACEI and Lasix.
Anemia may be secondary to CRI.
6) TYPE II DM: Pt is diet controlled at nursing home.
Urinary anion gap c/w RTA.
As per renal recs no further management.
