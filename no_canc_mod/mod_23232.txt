Admission Date:  [**2151-12-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-12-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from PACU post-op with unresponsiveness, hypercarbia, and re-intubation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right hip repair Endotracheal intubation   History of Present Illness: 84 y/o female with h/o dementia, HTN, and old compression fractures who was found down in nursing home with new hip fracture.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was given 5 mg of morphine and became very somnolent with a RR of 6.
Pt was complaining of diffuse back tenderness so a CT scan was obtained of her c,t and l-spine.
The CT of the cervical spine was concerning for a ligamentous tear so neurosurgery was consulted who recommended a cervical MRI.
Patient went to the OR today for a right gamma nail procedures and had several pins placed.
She was started on CPAP, but appeared to have agonal respirations.
Prior to transfer, she was given propofol and became somewhat hypotensive and required ephedrine.
HTN 4.
Hypothyroidism 5.
Colon CA s/p colectomy '[**38**] 6. s/p CCY 7.
Thoracic compression fracture 8.
Family History: Non contributory  Physical Exam: T: 98.9 BP: 101/39 P: 89 AC 500x16, 0.5, peep 5, 100% GEN: intubated, sedated, elderly female, intermittently agitated and moving all extremities but not following commands HEENT: anicteric sclera, pupils 4->3 mm bilaterally NECK: cervical collar in place RESP: CTA anteriorly, no w/r/c CV: RRR, I/VI SEM at apex ABD: soft, nt/nd, +bs EXT: R hip wound c/d/i, no ecchymosis or tenderness, 2+ dp/pt pulses bilaterally SKIN: warm/dry   Pertinent Results: CT of c-spine [**12-18**]: 1.
Exaggerated cervical lordosis with widening of C4/C5 and C5/C5 with slight retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 which may reflect injury to the anterior longitudinal ligament, and therefore, further evaluation with MRI is recommended if clinically warranted.
Linearly lucency in the anterior-superior endplate of T2, not seen on prior CT C-spine on [**2151-5-27**], which may represent an acute or subacute fracture as noted above.
Stable appearance of T12 and L1 compression fracture compared to L-spine radiograph obtained on [**2151-5-27**].
Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation with common bile duct measuring approximately 9 mm.
Left parapelvic cyst.
4 mm kidney stone in the left renal pelvis.
CT head [**12-18**]: No intracranial hemorrhage.
Biapical scarring/pleural thickening is without change.
There is left retrocardiac opacity without obscuration of the adjacent hemidiaphragm.
No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are identified.
There is biapical pleural thickening.
No pneumothorax.
No consolidation is identified.
Previously identified loss of vertebral body height at T6 and T11 is incompletely assessed as there is no lateral view for correlation.
The linear interstitial opacities involving the bilateral lung apices and left lower lobe are suboptimally assessed given patient rotation.
** Hip [**12-18**]: acute right intertrochanteric fracture and avulsion of the lesser trochanter .
[**2151-12-19**] MR Cervical spine No evidence of acute injury to the cervical spine.
No evidence of ligamentous disruption or vertebral malalignment.
No evidence of marrow edema.
Mild degenerative changes.
[**2151-12-21**] CXR Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates no significant interval change from the study earlier today.
There remains obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm with left retrocardiac opacity representing either atelectasis or consolidation.
[**2151-12-21**] Carotid Series Bilateral less than 40% ICA stenosis.
Moderate proximal right CCA stenosis.
Brief Hospital Course: This 84 year old woman with dementia and known compression fractures found down at nursing home with a right hip fracture.
Respiratory failure Pt's initial ABG with respiratory acidosis, likely due to sedation causing CO2 retention, which is similar to what happened in ED, and responded to narcan.
Other possibility is that she had an intracranial event intraoperatively that affected her mental status, which is especially concerning given her carotid bruit.
Less likely possibility is intracranial event; head CT was negative.
She continued to have an oxygen requirement, and CXR showed a possible retrocardiac opacity.
She will complete a course of ABx for pneumonia.
Her oxygen requirement is most likely [**1-28**] to pneumonia and mechanical limitations of breathing.
Tachycardia She remained in sinus tachycardia in the MICU and floor.
She was given some IVF and pain was treated with tylenol and lidocaine TP.
With hydration and treatment of her pain, her tachycardia completely resolved.
Telemetry was significant only for sinus tachycardia which later resolved.
Right hip fracture Pt had a right hip repair by orthopedics on [**12-19**].
cervical injury Neurosurg was consulted regarding widening of C4/C5 with slight retrolithesis of C4 on C5 and linear lucency of T2 and rec cervical MRI to eval for ligamentous injury.
Cervical MRI was without new injury or tear, and collar was removed.
Hct drop Unclear etiology, wound looks good without evidence of hematoma, no melena/BRBPR.
Likely was volume depleted when found in NH that led to Hct 37, then dropped with IVF.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 537**]- [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pneumonia s/p fall s/p right hip repair .
You were started on 2 antibiotics to treat a pneumonia.
