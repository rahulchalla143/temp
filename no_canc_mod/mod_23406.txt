At that time a CT scan was performed which showed dilated intrahepatic ducts predominantly in the left lobe of the liver and also in the right.
At that time further evaluation was pursued with LFTs check and MRCP, which demonstrated severe biliary dilatation of the left lobe without definitive obstruction seen, as well as an altered T2-weighted signal in the perihilar region raising concerns for cholangiocarcinoma.
On the floor, patient denies any fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, jaundice, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea.
Denies palpitation, dysuria, arthralgias or myalgias.
Review of systems: (+/-) Per HPI   Past Medical History: h/o CVA CAD Hypertension Gastroesophageal reflux disease, Hyperlipidemia Memory Difficulties  Past Surgical History: -s/p cholecystectomy -s/p cardiac cath/PCI with stents >5yrs ago -s/p wisdom tooth excision -?cataract surgery   Social History: No tobacco, no alcohol, no IVDU.
Pulm: CTAB no crackles or wheezes Abd: soft, slightly distended and tympanitic, minimal BS.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2102-9-25**] ERCP Unopacified 2 cm of left intrahepatic duct at the confluence with the CHD with irregularity in the adjacent right intrahepatic ducts and marked dilation of the left intrahepatic ducts.
Tumor involving the left hepatic bile duct with resultant left intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, left portal vein encasement and atrophy of segment IV.
No definite tumor involving the common bile duct, although the tumor extends to the bifurcation 3.
Right hydronephrosis due to mass effect on extrarenal pelvis by simple renal cyst.
Pulmonary nodule within the left upper lobe measuring 7-mm.
[**2102-9-27**] BIL ENDOSCOPY Successful left-sided percutaneous biliary drainage of a dilated left biliary system with brushings obtained for cytologic assessment.
[**2102-9-30**] ECHO: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
[**2102-10-5**]  Persantine stress test: No anginal type symptoms or objective evidence of myocardial ischemia.
[**2102-10-5**] CARDIAC PERFUSION PERSANTINE: Moderate partially reversible inferolateral wall perfusion defect and left ventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 41%.
She underwent IR guided percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage on the [**9-27**].The PTC done during the procedure showed marked dilatation of the left-sided biliary system with a focal stenosis in the left hepatic duct a few cm proximal to the confluence of the right and left main hepatic ducts.Post-op she developed tachycardia and fever to >103.
She was continued on antibiotics and got several fluid boluses.
Her blood culture came out to be positive for Klebsiella which had indeterminate sensitivity to zosyn, so zosyn was replaced with meropenum.On [**9-30**] She underwent an ECHO which showed mild LV dysfunction c/w PAD CAD.
She underwent a Cardiac Perfusion studu with Persantine which showed moderate partially reversible inferolateral wall perfusion defect and left ventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 41%.She was cleared by cardiology for future operative procedures.She was not able to ambulate without assistance and hence PT reccomended her to be discharged to rehab facility.
