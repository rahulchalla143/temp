Admission Date:  [**2153-2-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-3-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-1-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1390**] Chief Complaint: Weakness, fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2153-2-9**]: ex-lap with small bowel resection and primary anastamosis [**2153-2-18**]: re-do ex-lap, small bowel resection and primary anastamosis   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81F with a history of schizoaffective disorder and multiple comorbidities who was admitted to the medical service s/p fall in the setting of hypotension and abdominal pain.
Prior to presentation, patient stated that she was having rectal pain, increasing abdominal girth, and intermittent abdominal pain.
She also reports episodes of bilious vomiting over the last year with dark stools.
She has had weight loss of unknown quantity which she attributes to poor appetite.
On admission, patient was not found to have any injuries but did have a CT scan showing a new rectal mass, pancreatic tail mass that is increased in size, and multiple pulmonary nodules.
Her CT also showed mild small bowel thickening with possible thickening consistent with gastroenteritis or ischemia.
Patient's abdominal pain had largely resolved at that point, so she was kept NPO, hydrated with IV fluids, and serially examined.
On the day the surgical consult was placed, she began to complain of worsening right sided abdominal pain.
She has had low grade tachycardia with moderate urine output (275 for 18 hours today).
Her acute kidney injury has worsened.
Surgery was consulted after repeat CT showed worsened small bowel thickening and interloop fluid.
She currently complains of significant nausea and abdominal pain.

MICROBIOLOGY URINE CULTURE (Final [**2153-2-7**]):    NO GROWTH.
Probable sinus tachycardia with a single ventricular premature beat.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Ventricular premature beat is new.
ST-T wave abnormalities are new.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
CT ABDOMEN PELVIS [**2153-2-6**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute disease.
Borderline dilated loops of fluid-filled small bowel with trace inter-loop fluid in the mesenteric root, which is non-specific.
While this can be seen in gastroenteritis, the history of hypotension raises the possibility of a low-flow bowel ischemia.
No pneumatosis or free intraperitoneal air.
There are extensive atherosclerotic calcifications in the aorta and its branches without obvious arterial thrombus.
No bowel obstruction.
No evidence of colitis.
Eccentric wall thickening in the right posterior rectum.
Pancreatic tail cystic lesion is unchanged from [**Month (only) **] [**2152**], but has increased in size from [**2148**], again raising the possibility of neoplasm.
4mm right lower lobe nodule unchanged from [**2152-11-23**].
Worsening concentric wall thickening in the distal ileum and ascending colon, highly concerning for bowel ischemia, likely resulting in a non-mechanical SBO.
Eccentric wall thickening in the right posterior rectum and pancreatic tail cystic lesion, are similar to the prior study and need further evaluation.
CT Head [**2153-2-16**]: No acute intracranial process.
If clinical concern for intracranial mass or stroke is high, MRI is more sensitive.
EEG [**2153-2-15**]: Abnormal EEG due to slowing and disorganization of the background, bursts of generalized slowing, and occasional left frontocentral sharp waves.
The first two abnormalities signify a widespread encephalopathy.
There were no repetitive discharges to suggest ongoing seizures.
There is no evidence of recurrent pleural effusion.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course:                         ** PRIOR TO SURGICAL INTERVENTION ** Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted from the ED to the medical service for management of her abdominal pain and hypotension.
Her hospital course from [**2153-2-6**] to [**2153-2-9**] is described below by problem:  # ABDOMINAL PAIN- On admission patient was noted to have diffuse lower abdominal pain with associated abdominal distension.
Initial CT demonstrated some small bowel thickening which was non specific and consistent with gastroenteritis versus ischemia from a low flow state from her recent hypotension.
There were no signs of colitis.
Pain initially improved with NG decompression but subsequently worsened prompting repeat CT which showed worsened small bowel thickening and interloop fluid.
Surgery was consulted given concern for obstruction and mesenteric ischemia.
# RECTAL MASS- CT was concerning for rectal wall thickening.
Rectal exam was notable for a soft mildly tender mass.
GI was consulted as above and recommend flexible sigmoidoscopy for biopsy once the patient was clinically improved.
# PANCREATIC MASS- Patient noted to have a cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail unchanged from a CT done in [**11-26**] but new increasing in size from [**2148**].
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION- Patient has a known history of post operative atrial fibrillation.
# ACUTE on CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE- Patients creatinine was elevated from her baseline of 1.4 to 1.6 on admission.
On HD 3 creatinine trended upward to 2.0 and urine output decreased suggesting poor renal perfusion.
# CAD- Patient was continued on her home beta blocker and aspirin # GERD- Patient was continued on omeprazole # DM- Patients home glyburide was held and she was maintained on a ISS #Schizoaffective disorder- Patient was continued on seroquel                            ** AFTER SURGICAL ASSESSMENT ** Surgical consultation was requested on [**2153-2-9**] and exam was consistent with peritonitis.
She was taken to the OR emergently for exploratory laparotomy where a closed loop obstruction was discovered with ischemic small bowel.
Her postop course was complicated by a wound infection and anastomotic leak requiring return to the OR for additional resection and repeat anastomosis.
Her course is described below by system:  Neuro: With weaning of sedation, patient became agitated with possible myoclonic jerks of her lower extremities.
Neurology was consulted and Head CT showed no abnormalities.
EEG showed diffuse slowing and no evidence of ongoing seizures.
After extubation, she was conversant with no major neurologic deficit.
Control was attempted with diltiazem drip, however she became hypotensive.
Resp: Patient was difficult to wean from the vent due to underlying COPD and fluid overload.
She displayed bilateral pleural effusions which were resistant to medical diuresis, so bilateral chest tubes were placed which each drained several liters of transudate prior to being removed HD 22 and 24.
A post pull chest x-ray on [**3-1**] revealed no reaccumulation of pleural effusions and remnant basal atelectasis on the left.
GI: Patient's wound developed erythema on POD#3 for which patient was started on cefazolin.
The following day her wound was opened and culture grew MRSA so vanco was added to the regimen.
By POD 9 from her first ex-lap, she developed increasing abdominal pain and fever and was found to have an anastomic leak in the small bowel.
A CT abdomen [**2-26**] confirmed no anastomotic leak.
Her Hct was stable and she was given heparin sc for DVT prophylaxis, then heparin drip while transitioning to coumadin.
Following discovery of the leak and subsequent OR, her coverage was broadened to Vanc/Cipro/Flagyl.
The vancomycin was DC'd [**2-22**] following treatment of her MRSA wound infection.
Social: Patient has had a healthcare proxy (her sister) who no longer functions as one, therefore steps were taken to establish Guardianship for medical decision making.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Small bowel obstruction  Secondary: Anastamotic leak Hypotension Atrial fibrillation MRSA wound infection Acute pulmonary edema Acute kidney injury  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after suffering a fall in the setting of low blood pressure and abdominal pain.
You sustained no injuries from your fall but a new mass in your rectum as well as increase in the size of the known mass in your pancreas was seen on CT scan.
It is recommended that you have a sigmoidoscopy to biopsy the rectal mass as well as a study called an MRCP to further evaluate the mass seen on your pancreas.
You were also found to have a small bowel obstruction which required surgery to fix.
However, you had complications from your first operation and second operation was required to fix this.
