Admission Date:  [**2137-11-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-11-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-6-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**] Chief Complaint: Kidney stones, Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Regarding her kidney stone, she had a history of multiple UTIs and left side flank pain.
She underwent PCN without operative complications with EBL 300, receiving 2.5 LR.
In the PACU, she was noted to be hypotensive to SBP 90s, and received 1.5L of fluid and neo 100mcg x3, morphine 10mg and a propofol drip.
Cardiac enzymes were noted to be elevated at trop 0.15 and anti TWI were noted in the EKG and she was started on aspirin and a betablocker and cardiology consulted.
She was extubated the next day on [**11-16**] without difficulty and on [**11-17**] the PCN tube was removed.
She otherwise has been without complaints.
Past Medical History: - Diabetes - Hypertension - Obesity - OSA - Hypothyroidism - Hypertriglyceremia  Social History: She is a legal secretary.
There is vascular plethora and patchy alveolar opacity throughout both lungs, most pronounced in the perihilar areas and left base.
While this could relate to alveolar edema and/or pneumonic consolidation, the appearance is likely accentuated by low lung volumes in supine positioning.
No supine film evidence of pneumothorax is identified, though small pneumothoraces may not be readily apparent on a supine film.
[**2137-11-15**] Percutaneous Nephrostomy: LEFT PERCUTANEOUS NEPHROSTOMY AND URETERAL GUIDEWIRE PLACEMENT FOR LITHOTRIPSY ACCESS ON [**11-15**]  INDICATION: Large left renal pelvis calculus.
Percutaneous access requested for lithotripsy.
Local 1% Xylocaine anesthesia and moderate sedation using four divided doses of fentanyl for a total dosage of 200 mcg and two divided doses of Versed for a total dosage of 2 mg over one hour.
Antegrade nephrostogram demonstrated no hydronephrosis of the left renal collecting system, with contrast tracking around the large stone in the renal pelvis and down into a nondilated left ureter.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications and was transferred to the OR for subsequent lithotripsy.
IMPRESSION: Uneventful creation of percutaneous access, as detailed above, for subsequent lithotripsy of the large stone in the left renal pelvis.
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the myocardium.
No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the study.
No additional ST segment depressions were observed during exercise or in recovery.
The rhythm was sinus with no ectopy.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms with non-specific T wave changes.
Nuclear report sent separately  Brief Hospital Course: 57 YO f h/o DM, HTN s/p percutaenous nephrolithotomy, complicated by respiratory failure and NSTEMI.
NSTEMI: The patient was noted to have elevated troponin of 0.15, with elevated CK and CK-MB while she was in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] post-op for respiratory management.
In the PACU, the patient was noted to be transiently hypotense and oliguric, likely secondary to oversedation in the OR.
EKG also showed TWI in I, aVL, V2-V6.
The patient was intubated at the time but did not demonstrate signs or symptoms of an acute cardiac event.
Once she was extubated in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient denied any cardiac symptoms.
An ACEI was held in the setting of an elevated creatinine.
Her event was thought to be NSTEMI, with possible demand component given transient hypotension.
Her respiratory failure was thought due to oversedation with a component of obesity hypoventilation.
She ws extubated without incident with no residual symptoms.
On transfer to the floor and on discharge, the patient was breathing well on room air without any episode of shortness of breath.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A recent A1C was 5.5.
A lipid panel was drawn on [**11-19**], which showed an elevated triglyceride level.
Elevated Creatinine:  The patient's creatinine peaked at 1.5 during admission, thought to be due to pre-renal azotemia.
Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction 2.
Respiratory failure 2.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 3.
Hypertension 4.
Hypothyroidism 5.
Hyper-Triglyceremia   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, hemodynamically stable.
Please return to the hospital with any chest pain, shortness of breath, trouble urinating, abdominal pain, or any symptoms that concern you.
You were diagnosed with a small heart attack.
Given that you have diabetes, it is likely that you have coronary artery disease.
