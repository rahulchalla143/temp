GI Bleed: Admitted after an episode of painless hematochezia at home.
On first day of hospitalization, patient developed frank hematochezia and became hypotensive with SBP in 70s-80s.
Serum electrolytes, especially calcium were monitored carefully and repleted as necessary with massive transfusion requirement.
Colonoscopy on [**12-9**] showed diverticulosis in the entire colon, blood in the mid ascending colon through sigmoid colon and no evidence of active bleed.
On the morning of [**12-10**], patient had another drop in Hct to 24 and was transfused another UpRBCs.
He remained hemodynamically stable without further melena or hematochezia and was transferred to floor for further management.
He had no evidence of active bleed (guiac negative stool) or symptoms of anemia.
Follow up with GI for presumed diverticular bleed was arranged as outpatient.
HTN: As above, the patient's b-blocker was initially held in the setting of his acute bleed.
Once hematocrit had stabilized and the patient had no further evidence of active diverticular bleeding, metoprolol was started at a reduced dose of 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
Metamucil     Powder Sig: One (1)  PO once a day as needed for constipation.
