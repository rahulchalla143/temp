Family History: Mother died of CAD at 61, a sister of CAD at 50, another sister at 54.

The LAD had a 40% stenosis at the origin.
There was a "shelf-like" 90% stenosis at the takeoff of the D1.
The distal LAD had mild to moderate diffuse disease.
The LCx had mild diffuse disease throughout its course about the AV groove.
The OM1, OM2, and OM3 were all relatively small caliber vessels with mild plaquing.
The remaining RCA had mild luminal irregularities.
The R-PDA had moderate disease at its origin.
There were no collaterals noted.
There was 3+ mitral regurgitation noted.
CNIS [**9-23**]: Minimal right ICA plaque, no associated stenosis (graded as less than 40%).
Chest CT [**9-25**]: Biapical scarring without evidence of cavitation or small airways disease to suggest active infection.
Probable focus of nodular scarring within superior segment right lower lobe adjacent to superior portion of major fissure; however, in the setting of emphysema, a scar carcinoma cannot be excluded.
Prominent right paratracheal lymph nodes which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement, but should be reassessed on the followup chest CT in three months.
Bilateral thyroid nodules measuring up to 22 mm in size on the right.
Extensive coronary artery and aortic valve calcifications.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-2**]+)mitral regurgitation is seen.
Stable appearance of left retrocardiac density that could represent collapse and/or consolidation.
Persistent pleural effusions.
She underwent cath on [**9-22**] which revealed 2 vessel coronary artery disease [**Doctor First Name **] with mitral and aortic valve disease.
She then underwent an echocardiogram which confirmed moderate to severe aortic stenosis but showed only mild mitral regurgitation.
She underwent multiple diagnostic work-up prior to surgery which included CNIS, chest CT, and dental consult.
On post-op day one she had an episode of SVT which was cardioverted electrically and started on Amiodarone.
On post-op day three she again had episode of SVT which converted to SR. She was started on Coumadin.
On post-op day four pulmonary medicine consulted on Ms. [**Known lastname **] for pre-op w/u that revealed apical nodule densities.
