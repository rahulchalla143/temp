Admission Date:  [**2164-2-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-2-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-11-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Drug Allergy Information on File  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**] Chief Complaint: Cardiogenic Shock  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD  History of Present Illness: This is a 70 year-old woman with scleroderma and EtOH abuse who was brought to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] today from home by EMS with complaint of one month of poor PO intake, fatigue, and malaise.
She was sent for a CT head and abdomen, and when lying flat she apparently started vomiting coffee ground material and then arrested (CT scan not completed).
She was given CPR, epi x3, atropine x1, HCO3 x2 amps, and pulse returned with sinus rhythm, but hypotensive.
NGT from OSH noted to be coiled in the esophagus, so new OGT was placed with frank blood and clots initially which cleared with NS and then bright red blood recurred.
FAST exam showed free fluid in the abdomen.
CT scan showed bilateral infiltrates, diffuse colitis, ascites, fatty liver.
Surgery was consulted and felt there is no acute surgical issue.
She was given 4 more L NS, calcium and magnesium repletion, octreotide gtt, and 2U FFP in the ED.
Past Medical History: scleroderma [**Last Name (un) 8061**] EtOH abuse hypothyroidism GERD iron deficiency anemia GERD   Social History: Per sister, patient lives at home and is bed/wheelchair bound.
HEENT: Pupils nonreactive, mild icterus.
CV: RRR, no m/r/g Resp: Coarse and rhoncherous breath sounds diffusely bilaterally.
Mildly firm, distended.
Neuro: Not responsive to commands or noxious stimuli.
Babinskis equivocal.
Skin: Diffuse macular erythematous rash and extensive skin sloughing.
Stage I decubitus ulcers on L ear, b/l hips.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Air-fluid levels within the paranasal sinuses which most likely are related to intubation.
Massive bilateral consolidations which could be related to aspiration.
Bilateral small pleural effusions.
Bowel wall thickening of ascending and descending colon and small abdominopelvic ascites.
Inflammatory or ischemic causes are other considerations, although ischemia appears less likely given the distribution.
EGD: Impression: Posterior oropharyngeal laceration Extensive blood clot in the esophagus Old blood in the duodenum Erythema and congestion in the whole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear Old blood in the stomach Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: Double dose PPI IV Do not replace NGT/OGT   Brief Hospital Course: MUTLIFACTORIAL SHOCK: Ms. [**Known lastname 467**] likely presented with GI illness with poor po intake and suspected nausea/vomiting given [**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, which led to large GI bleed contributing to hypotension.
She likely aspirated at [**Hospital1 **] when she arrested in the CT scanner, leading to cardiogenic shock.
Sepsis was also included in the initial differential given that she had bandemia on [**Location (un) 8062**] CBC, suspicious for pulmonary or GI source, given colitis seen on abdominal CT. She was supported fully with dopamine and vasopressin, in addition to volume and blood, FFP, and cryoprecipitate.
A discussion of prognosis was had with the medical intensive care unit team and the patient's sister, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], who was listed as next of [**Doctor First Name **].
She had bilateral consolidations consistent with aspiration.
GI BLEED: Upper endoscopy revealed old blood and clot in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, as well as [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear that was likely the initial culprit of the GI bleed.
She also had a laceration on her soft palate.
ENT examined but it was no longer bleeding.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Recent baseline in CCC of 0.8, up to 2.5 on admission here.
Likely related to hypovolemia from blood loss (pre-renal), plus Acute Kidney Injury from hypotension.
METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Anion gap acidosis with markedly elevated lactate s/p cardiac arrest in the setting of hypotension.
Also concern for bowel ischemia, although CT read more consistent with infectious colitis.
POssible contribution from renal failure as well.
(?protonix, folate per OSH record; multivitamins, Protonix, levothyroxine, lorazepam, and Tylenol per [**2161**] OMR note)  Discharge Medications: None  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Cardiac Arrest, within 24 hours of interhospital transfer Cardiogenic Shock Upper GI Bleed due to [**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear Aspiration Pneumonia Acute Renal Failure  Secondary: Scleroderma Gastroesophageal Reflux Disorder Alcohol Abuse Iron Deficiency Anemia.
