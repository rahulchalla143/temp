Admission Date:  [**2114-10-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-11-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-3-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**] Chief Complaint: Ventricular tachycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p stellate ganglion block   History of Present Illness: 67 y/o female with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (possibly from myocarditis presumed viral >10 years ago) with LVEF of 20% (non-ischemic), moderate mitral regurgitation (improved on recent echo), BiV ICD, who was admitted to CCU in late [**Month (only) 359**] for VT ablation following ICD discharges in [**Month (only) **].
During the procedure, it was found that she has multiple inducible VT's arising from septum, lateral wall and apex.
Following that discharge, she continued to have frequent sustained VT, and was subsequently readmitted [**10-22**] with more symptomatic VT which was paced and not shocked.
This morning she was walking from her bathroom and felt palpitations with associated lightheadedness for approximately 30 seconds.
This AM, she was walking from her bathroom and felt palpitations and lightheadedness for approximately 30 seconds.
She denied chest pain/pressure, SOB, nausea during this episode.
Upon arrival, EP interrogated the device which showed VT at a rate of ~120 BPM, which was attempted to be broken by ATP twice and ultimately shocked twice with escalating joules.
On arrival to the floor, she initially felt well without any palpitations or lightheadedness.
She then received Ativan 1 mg IV and Lidocaine 100 mg IV once at 1400 with subsequent resolution of her VT. At 1755 she again went into VT and recevied Metoprolol 5 m IV once and an additional 50 mg IV Lidocaine.
Family History: Negative for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and sudden death.
There is no diabetes or hypertension in the family history.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
STRESS EKG INTERPRETATION: This 67 year old woman with LVEF of 20% and history of dilated cardiomyopathy and VT was referred to the lab for evaluation.
The estimated peak MET capacity was 1.5 which represents a poor functional capacity.
No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the study.
The ST segments are uninterpretable for ischemia in the setting of the v-paced rhythm.
The rhythm was a-v paced with rare isolated vpbs.
Resting hypotension with a slight increase in systolic BP with exercise.
IMPRESSION: No symptoms or sustained ectopy with uninterpretable ST segments at the achieved level of exercise.
Brief Hospital Course: 67-year-old woman with an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 20% (non-ischemic), moderate mitral regurgitation (improved on recent echo), BiV ICD, recent study for endocardial/epicardial ablation of multifocal VT that were found to arise from septum, lateral wall and apex, recently ablated [**2114-10-25**].
Now presenting with recurrent VT and shocks x2.
Acetaminophen 500 mg PO Q6H PRN pain 7.
Disp:*90 Tablet Extended Release(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventricular tachycardia S/p stellate ganglion block Cardiomyopathy Chronic kidney disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with ventricular tachycardia.
You underwent a stellate ganglion block that seems to have decreased the ventricular tachycardia.
You blood pressures have been low but you have not been dizzy or lightheaded so far.
If you have palpitations, if your device fires, if you feel dizzy or lightheaded call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
For your heart failure diagnosis: Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 poounds in 3 days, follow a low salt diet.
