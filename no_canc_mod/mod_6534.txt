There is new blood extension into the right lateral ventricle with new slight leftward midline shift (2A:16).
No new hemorrhage or large vascular territorial infarction is seen.
IMPRESSION: Interval marked enlargement of a right thalamic hematoma, with lateral and 4th intraventricular extension and new mild leftward shift of midline structures.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2158-7-28**] 2:19 PM Again noted is a right thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.
A  right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter terminates in the left lateral ventricle appropriately.
There is a small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal region at the burr hole site.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged right thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage at burr hole entry site.
No new areas of hemorrhage noted.
Short (approximately 1.5 cm) segmental circumferential mural edema involving the subglottic trachea, commencing 2 cm inferior to the level of the true vocal cords, which may correspond to the findings on examination.
No associated extrinsic compression upon or compromise of the endotracheal tube.
Laryngeal skeleton is grossly intact, with no discrete evidence of fracture of the laryngeal or arytenoid cartilages.
No consolidation or pulmonary edema Improved left pleural effusion.
Vague area of increased opacification in the retrocardiac region.
No evidence of vascular congestion.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2158-7-26**] the rate is slower and ST-T wave abnormalities are no longer present.

58 RHW with HTN was brought to the ED for evaluation of sudden onset left sided weakness and dysarthria.
On examination, she had dysarthria, left sided neglect, left facial droop and left hemiplegia.
Patient was significantly hypertensive (BP above 200/100) and CT head showed bleed in right thalamus.
ICPs were not significantly elevated and s/p EVD removal [**8-5**] and extubation with tracheostomy due to laryngeal edema on [**8-9**].
ICU course was complicated by VAP per [**8-3**] sputum Cx and was treated with 14 days of broad spectrum antibiotics.
Patient continued to have severe left hemiplegia although patient was later more alert and able to appropriately respond to questions with head nodding and writing.
Patient had problems with bleeding around tracheostomy and general surgery reviewed and this settled following sealant.
Given continued secretion problems ENT to follow-up and re-assess tracheostomy as out-patient.
Patient developed hyponatremia and this was felt likely SIADH in addition to diuretic use based on serum/urine Osm and electrolytes and patient was started concentrated PEG feed and hydrochlorothiazide was stopped.
NEURO: Patient with HTN presented with sudden onset left sided weakness and dysarthria.
On examination, she had dysarthria, left sided neglect, left facial droop and left hemiplegia.
Initial head CT at [**Hospital6 1597**] showed 2x2cm R thalamic hemorrhage.
At [**Hospital1 18**], head CT showed enlargement to 3.6 x 2.8 cm with lateral and 4th intraventricular extension and new mild leftward shift of midline structures.
Patient was significantly hypertensive (BP above 200/100) and ICH was felt to be a primary hypertensive bleed.
Initial ED neuro exam was significant for agitation and yelling but not following commands, and L hemiparesis of face, arm and leg.
Patient then deteriorated and her consciousness level declined.
Patient was treated with mannitol and however, as follow-up CT showed persistent evolution with intraventricular extension, an EVD was placed on [**7-27**].
Minimal withdrawal to noxious on left side which did not significantly improve during her stay.
Patient was extubated with tracheostomy due to laryngeal edema on [**8-9**].
Patient continued to have severe left hemiplegia although patient was later more alert and able to appropriately respond to questions with head nodding and writing.
We addressed risk factors and there were no events on telemetry.
Given continued secretion problems ENT to follow-up and re-assess tracheostomy in 4 weeks.
Home hydrochlorothiazide was stopped due to hyponatremia.
Extubation was attempted twice with the aid of steroids, furosemide, and fiberscope but was unable to be completed first due to laryngeal edema and then collapse of the arytenoid cartilage.
ENT was consulted for evaluation but they saw no structural damage to the cartilage.
Treated for VAP since [**8-6**] and sputum from [**8-3**] grew pseudomonas sensitive to cefepime and received a 14 day total antibiotic course.
Patient had oozing from around her tracheostomy and general surgery were consulted and felt no intervention was required.
Given continued secretion problems ENT to follow-up and re-assess tracheostomy on [**2158-9-20**].
# Hyponatremia: Patient has had low Na since [**8-17**].
Likely SIADH and was started on concentrated PEG feed and hydrochlorothiazide was stopped.
Speech and swallow saw her on [**8-11**] and was unable to complete the eval due to secretions.
# Renal: Hyponatremia as above.
# Psych: Patient likely reactive depression and was apathetic and at times tearful but latterly more alert and communicative.
Transitional issues: S/p tracheostomy - to be reviewed by ENT as above as an out-patient S/P PEG - some pain at site.
Monitor pain and giving PRN oxycodone Hyponatremia - Na 125 on discharge.
