She initially presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**4-28**] with increasing fatigue, nausea, myalgias, and anorexia x 1 month with abdominal distention, scleral icterus/jaundice x1 week where a RUQ US showed portal vein thrombosis.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 112**] on [**2107-4-29**] for further care of her decompenstate liver failure.
There her course had been complicated by HRS and fulminant hepatic failure.
She did not have suicidal/homicidal ideation.
She presented as inattentive with flat affect likely from hepatic encephalopathy.
Course was complicated by hemorrhoidal bleeding and a bleeding abrasion on left upper extremity.
She had poor access due to her peripheral edema.
In the MICU, CVL placement occurred with elevated INR (5.9 prior to administration of 2 [**Location 16678**]->3.5).
She remained in the ICU due to continued bleeding from her central line site.
Her transfusions were limited by worsening hepato-renal syndrome and generalized volume overload, which caused transient episodes of hypoxia.
The patient also demonstrated increasing somlenence and severe asterixis consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
Diminished diastolic flow was seen in the right hepatic artery.
LFTs continued to decrease with decreased jaundice.
A post pyloric tube was placed and tube feeds were started, but feeding tube was removed during an EGD performed on [**6-2**] for bloody stools.
EGD revealed portal gastropathy without bleeding source.
Of note, insulin was required for hyperglycemia from steroids.
She experienced hyperkalemia likely from RI and prograf effect.
IV meds (insulin, dextrose, calcium, bicarb, IV saline and lasix) were given to decrease potassium with only temporary fix of hyperkalemia.
