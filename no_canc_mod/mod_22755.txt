Admission Date:  [**2169-11-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-11-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2147-6-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: Traumatic Brain Injury  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2169-11-11**]: ICP bolt placement [**2169-11-11**]: Bifrontal craniectomies w/ bilateral frontal lobectomies [**2169-11-17**]: Trach/PEG/IVC Filter   History of Present Illness: 22 y/o F with no PMHx presents after falling out or jumping out of slow moving car early [**2169-11-11**] after a fight with boyfriend.
Patient became combative and was intubated and sedated.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical and trauma work up.
HEENT: atraumatic, normocephalic Pupils:3-2mm bilaterally         EOMs: unable to access Neck: c-collar Neuro: Patient sedated, no EO, no commands.
+cough, gag, and bilateral corneals PERRL 3-2mm bilaterally brisk localization to noxious stimuli with the LUE No movement in the RUE or BLE to noxious spontaneous tremor in RUE toes mute  Upon Discharge: awake, alert.
Multiple foci of intracranial hemorrhage including probable intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the inferior bifrontal lobes.
Right temporal bone fracture and 6 mm extra-axial collection could represent epidural/subdural hematoma and is slightly increased compared to the prior study when it measured 4 mm.
Multiple foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the bifrontal lobes.
Right occipital bone fracture.
Foci of gas within the right extraconal fat concerning for occult fracture.
CT Torso [**2169-11-11**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic, abdominal or pelvic injury.
Fracture through the squamous portion of the right temporal bone, and concern for questionable fracture extending through the petrous bone, although incompletely characterized.
Small amount of hematoma, and focus of air along the medial superior wall of the right orbit, and although no gross fracture is seen, we cannot exclude a fracture.
Bilateral foci of contusion in the frontal lobes, and subarachnoid hemorrhage better characterized on concurrent CT head.
L Ankle Xray [**2169-11-11**]: LEFT ANKLE, THREE VIEWS: There is apparent abnormal alignment of the tibiocalcaneal joint concerning for dislocation.
There is a lateral malleolar soft tissue swelling and probable small joint effusion.
No radiopaque foreign body or soft tissue calcification noted.
No erosive or suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified.
Post-surgical changes after bifrontal craniectomy and bifrontal lobectomy with small amount of acute blood and air in the postsurgical cavities.
Unchanged small right parietal extra-axial and post-surgical left temporal extra-axial acute hemorrhage.
Redistributed and more focal appearance of left frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the both frontal lobes adjacent to the postsurgical cavities is likely due to post-surgical edema.
No evidence of uncal herniation or large infarction  Head CT [**11-14**]: 1.
No evidence of new hemorrhage on the current examination.
[**11-14**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal extended EEG due to the presence of a discontinuous, mostly suppressed background interrupted by periods of low voltage theta activity.
This is consistent with a moderate to severe diffuse encephalopathy and can be seen with medication effect, hypoxic-ischemic injury, or severe traumatic brain injury.
The nearly continuous high voltage delta slowing seen maximally over the bifrontal regions is consistent with a skull defect with an underlying structural lesion.
There were no electrographic seizures seen.
[**11-15**] EEG:IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence of  nearly continuous rhythmic, high amplitude 1 Hz delta activity seen maximally over the bifrontal region representing non-convulsive status epilepticus which terminates at approximately 7:40 p.m.
However, there were again several electrographic seizures seen at 8:20 p.m., 9:26 p.m., 9:41 p.m., 11:27 p.m., 12:49 a.m., 1:40 a.m., 2:14 a.m., 3:05 a.m., 4:18 a.m., 4:39 a.m., 5:56 a.m., and 6:40 a.m. After this point, there was nearly continuous high voltage delta slowing, with mixed theta frequency activity, seen maximally over the bifrontal regions representing a breach rhythm with underlying cortical dysfunction.
The slowing of the background is consistent with a moderate to severe diffuse encephalopathy and is most commonly seen with medication effect, hypoxic/ischemic injury, or severe traumatic brain injury.
This tracing is worse compared to the previous record due to the presence of nearly continuous seizure activity at the beginning of the record followed by frequent seizures during the latter half of the recording.
[**11-16**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence of numerous (approximately 11) electrographic seizures, again characterized by rhythmic, high amplitude 1 Hz delta activity seen maximally over the bifrontal region occurring at the above times, and correlated to changes on quantitative EEG.
A number of these seizures appeared to begin over the right frontal leads, which may represent an ictal onset over the left median parasagittal region or the right frontal region.
Otherwise, the background consists of nearly continuous high voltage delta slowing, with mixed theta frequency activity, seen maximally over the bifrontal regions representing a breach rhythm with underlying cortical dysfunction.
The slowing of the background is consistent with a moderate to severe diffuse encephalopathy and is most commonly seen with medication effect, hypoxic-ischemic injury, or severe traumatic brain injury.
This tracing is improved compared to the previous record due the decreased frequency and duration of seizures.
[**2076-11-16**] EEG: PND *****  [**11-18**] Xray LEFT ANKLE, TWO VIEWS: There has been no significant change in the alignment of the ankle.
No dislocations or subluxations are dentified.
[**11-19**] MRI C-spine: IMPRESSION: No evidence of bony or ligamentous injury.
The subtle abnormalities seen on CT likely represent a nutrient canal as suggested previously.
No marrow edema is seen corresponding to the abnormality.
No evidence of cord compression or abnormal signal within the spinal cord.
Brief Hospital Course: 22F admitted to the Acute Care Service after sustaining a traumatic brain injury from jumping out of a moving vehicle.
She was then taken to the OR on [**2169-11-11**] for bifrontal craniectomies and bilateral frontal lobectomies.
there was a question that she may have had CSF otorrhea in her rigth ear so a cotton ball was placed to monitor for drainage.
her ICP's remained stable so it was decided to hold her SQH and that her bolt will be pulled on the morning of [**11-18**]  [**2076-11-17**] Her [**Last Name (un) 8745**] monitor was removed without difficulty.
She did well overnight and had no acute issues.
Speech/Swallow performed a video swallow test and she did not have any aspiration.
She was seen again by orthopedics who cleared her for weight bearing as tolerated on the left lower extremity and her cast was changed to an air splint.
2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
5. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
7. propranolol 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for BP control.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Traumatic Brain Injury Right Epidural Hematoma Bilateral Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Left IPH R Temporal & Occipt fracture left ankle dislocation, soft tissue injury   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
This is in regards to your left ankle injury and air splint.
