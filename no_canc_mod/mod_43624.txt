Admission Date:  [**2100-10-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2100-10-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2020-6-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 509**] Chief Complaint: Dizziness and Diaphoresis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 80 yo M with a h/o nephrolithiasis, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, angina, and BPH p/w diaphoresis and chest pain.
Recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 91606**] with dysuria presumed [**12-22**] to  EColi UTI and acute kidney injury secondary to nephrolithiasis and complicated by renal tubular acidosis.
In addition to the stones and UTI, he also had decreased PO intake.
Renal ultrasound showed unchanged obstructing nephrolithiasis on L at UPJ and non-obstructing R ureteral nephrolithiasis unchanged form previous imaging in [**2099-11-20**].
Urology was consulted and recommended IR placement of L percutaneous nephrostomy tube, which was performed by IR on the night of admission without complications.
SPEP and UPEP were sent showed no evidence of multiple myeloma.
The patient had various other issues including a fleeting transaminitis that was evaluated by ultrasound,  normocytic anemia with a hematocrit of 33.
Iron studies were deemed consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.

Previously-noted left hydronephrosis has improved, with now only pelvicaliectasis seen on the left side.
Previously noted left ureteropelvic junction stone is not well visualized on the current exam.
At least two right non-obstructing renal calculi are seen in the lower pole measuring 5 and 3 mm.
No right-sided hydronephrosis is present.
The urinary bladder is decompressed about a Foley catheter.
Currently, there is pelvicaliectasis on the left side.
Nonobstructing renal calculi and renal cysts in the right kidney are unchanged from prior.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 yo M with a h/o nephrolithiasis, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, angina, and BPH p/w diaphoresis nausea and chest pain.
Found to have a bradycardia and hyperkalemia initially refractory to standard maneuvers.He also noted vertigo on position changes whch was felt likely secondary to bradycardia.
Hyperkalemia was successfully treated with Ca gluconate, Insulin/dextrose, Kayexalate and furosemide and he had no further episodes of this and potassium remained in the normal range to discharge.
Bradycardia was felt to be secondary to atenolol toxicity and atenolol was held and his bradycardia improved to the 60s by discharge.
# Hyperkalemia: Initial hyperkalemia to 6.8 in ED in the setting of worsening renal function(creatinine 3.3 on admission) and was treated in the ED with 2 g CaGlu, 10 u regular insulin x 2, 30 g of kayexalate x 2 and 40mg of furosemide IV with 1L NS.
THis continued to be stable and was thought to have been a result of the combination of atenolol toxicity and renal failure.
ECG showed sinus bradycardia and this was felt to be atenolol toxicity and not due to hyperkalemia.
# Bradycardia: Mr [**Known lastname **] initially presented with vertigo, diaphoresis and chest pain in the context of bradycardia to 40-48 and was admitted to the MICU for management of hyperkalemia (which improved after treatment) and bradycardia which improved following stopping atenolol.
His initial ECGs showed appearances which appeared to alternate between what was thought to be a slow AF to what resembled a Mobitz 2 with 2:1 block and was latterly seen to be Sinus rhythm with bigeminal PACs and first degree AV block, PR interval= 230 ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] had a negative MI workup with negative cardiac enzymes x3.
Electrophysiology were consulted for further evaluation of persistent bradycardia to the 50s after discontinuation of atenolol.
Atenolol is a renally cleared beta blocker which was felt likely to have accumulated to high levels given the patient's poor renal clearance of the drug in the setting of acute kidney injury.
In addition, it was felt that the patient also likely had baseline sinus node dysfunction making him more sensitive to the effect of the beta blockade.
On reviewing previous results, he has had longstanding AV node delay and bradycardia as evidenced on a Holter recording from [**6-27**].
Barring any further progression of his underlying nodal dysfunction, it is likely that the patient will return to his baseline once the atenolol effect has fully cleared and indeed by the day of discharge, his heart rate was increasing to the 60s.
The plan was therefore to continue to hold all beta blockers for now and use non renally excreted beta blockers in the future such as metoprolol if clinically indicated.
There was no need for a pacemaker but if his nodal disease worsens, this can be addressed as an out-patient.
# Renal Insufficiency: The patient has nephrolithiasis and is s/p left nephrostomy for hydronephrosis.
From a baseline of 1.6 in [**2099-11-20**], the patient had a recent admission for [**Last Name (un) **] with possible new baseline of 3.0.
Creatinien was 3.3 on anmission and had hyperkalemia as described above with a K 6.8.
A renal ultrasound was performed on [**10-20**] showed interval improvement in left sided hydronephrosis and nonobstructing renal calculi and renal cysts in the right kidney were unchanged from prior studies.
# Vertigo: The patinet noted vertiginous symptoms on sitting forward with no change on head-turing.
Initial considerations included BPPV although abrupt head turning demonstrated no nystagmus and did not bring on symptoms.
Latterly this was felt to be the result of his bradycardia and was recovering as his heart rate increased.
# Weight loss: Patient claimed he had lost 40 pounds in ~ 2 years.
He had evidence of temporal wasting and denied depression.
# Coronary artery disease: Mr [**Known lastname **] had episodes of chest pain on admission which was felt to be likely due to his bradycardia and he was ruled out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes x3.
His isosorbide mononitrate was held due to low BP and should be restarted in the community by his PCP.

You were noted to have a very slow pulse.
You were taken to the emergency department and you were found to have worsening of your renal failure and a high potassium level.
You continued to have a low pulse and you were admitted overnight for observation in the Intensive Care Unit.
You had an ultrasound of your kidneys which showed improved distension of your left kidney.
It was felt that your symptoms could be accounted for by toxic levels of your atenolol and this was stopped.
There was no evidence of a heart attack on blood tests.
BY [**10-22**] your heart rate had improved and you were reviewed by cardiology regarding you low pulse and they felt that this was due to your atenolol.
Your dizziness improved and this was felt likely due to your low  pulse.
Instructions to patient: If you have further worsening symptom or further chest pain, you should seek medical attention.
