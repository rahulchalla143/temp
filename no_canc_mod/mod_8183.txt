Admission Date:  [**2104-3-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-3-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2042-6-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10435**] Chief Complaint: hemetemesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: upper endoscopy (EGD)  History of Present Illness: 61yo F PMHx HCV Cirrhosis c/b ascites, encephalopathy and HCC, s/p multiple TACE, recent hospitalization for [**Last Name (un) **] and AMS, who presents after 2 episodes of coffee ground emesis.
She reports no fevers, chills, abdominal pain.
She had a routine MRI of abdomen performed yesterday to evaluate for progression of liver disease which showed a cirrhotic, heterogeneous liver with multiple hypoenhancing nodules, similar in appearance to past scans.
She had been admitted earlier this month for work up of lethargy, fatigue, elevated lactate (5.4 down to 1.9), and ARF, thought to be due to acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of hypovolemia from decreased PO intake and recent addition of diuretics to her medication regimen.
Patient was mildly lethargic, sleeping, but arouseable, reporting no pain or discomfort.
Hepatitis C status post failed treatments with interferon and ribavarin.
Hepatocellular carcinoma status post TACE to the right liver on [**2102-6-9**], left liver on [**2102-11-28**], right liver [**2103-1-15**], and most recently a superselective right liver segment V/ VIII TACE on [**2103-10-11**].
She underwent an MRI after that on [**2103-11-9**] that showed good response to treatment of three lesions in segment II, VII, and VIII and no enhancement seen in those lesions, there are no new arterially enhancing lesions and the spleen was enlarged, pancreas and adrenals are unremarkable.
It is unclear whether they had HCC or cirrhosis.
Father: MI at age 50, Brother: MI with CABG at age 62, Mother: HTN  Physical Exam: Admission exam: Vitals: 96.9 112 103/73 22 96RA General: mildly lethargic, comfortable HEENT: +icterus, MMM, oropharynx clear, PERRL Neck: supple, no JVD, no LAD CV: tachycardic, no murmurs Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abdomen: Distended, non-tender, dull to percussion, no rebound/guarding, or CVA tenderness GU: + foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ DP/PT, no cyanosis/edema Neuro: AOx2 (name, "hospital"), moving all extremities, +asterixis  On discharge vitals were T 99.3, BP 112/57, HR 76, RR 20, O2sat 97%RA.
She was AAOx2 with mild asterixis (felt to be her baseline mental status).
Limited evaluation of the hepatic parenchyma secondary to non-breathhold technique (used because patient was having difficultly following inststructions).
Treated lesions in segment II, segment VII, the junction of segments V and VIII again demonstrate no enhancement and are grossly unchanged.
There are no new arterially-enhancing lesions identified.
Cirrhotic, heterogeneous liver with multiple hypoenhancing nodules, similar in appearance to [**2103-11-9**].
CT head [**2104-3-1**]:  No acute intracranial process.
Area of white matter hypodensity on the left frontal subcortical region, likely represents sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease, correlation with MRI is advised if clinically warranted.
Apparent new patchy opacity in the left infrahilar region.
There is rotated positioning with low inspiratory volumes.
This likely contributes to accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature.
There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle and new atelectasis at the right base.
[**2104-3-2**]: Patchy opacity, left greater than right bases, ?
atelectasis versus pneumonic infiltrate.
Cirrhotic liver and multiple liver lesions, better assessed in the prior MRI study of [**2104-2-29**].
Brief Hospital Course: 61yoF with h/o HCV c/b ESLD and HCC s/p multiple TACE admitted for hematemesis [**2-7**] UGIB.
Active Issues:  # Hematemesis / Acute Anemia: Patient admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for coffee ground emesis, concerning for variceal bleed in a cirrhotic patient.
Patient was started on pantopraole and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleed and started on prophylatic ceftriaxone for SBP in setting of GI bleed.
She completed 5 days of IV Ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis.
# Cirrhosis c/b ascites, encephalopathy, HCC: patient was restarted on lactulose after she was extubated.
She had no e/o acute liver decompensation during admission.
Her aldactone and lasix were initially held in the ICU in setting of acute GI bleed and then restarted on discharge.
# Elevate Lactate: Pt had elevated lactate on admission, likely representing poor perfusion of tissues in setting of poor clearance by liver in addition to hypovolemia [**2-7**] GIB.
Chronic Issues:  # Altered Mental Status: At baseline patient is lethargic, has had extensive outpatient workup for her mental status.
# Depression: Continued fluoxetine  # Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine  Transitional Issues: #Medication changes: -START nadolol 20mg daily -START pantoprazole 40mg daily - take for 30 days -START carafate 1g four times daily - take for 2 weeks -STOP metoprolol succinate - please follow up with your primary care physician about whether to restart this medication in the future -STOP omeprazole while taking pantoprazole - you can resume your home omeprazole after you finish your course of pantoprazole #Follow-up: She is scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic and for repeat liver MRI on the day after discharge.
