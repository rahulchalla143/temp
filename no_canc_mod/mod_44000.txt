Blurring of the fat planes between the anterior strap muscles with increased asymmetric soft tissue infiltration both anterior and posterior to the hyoid bone is noted, again largely right sided Some suggestion of small ~1 cm fluid collections posterior to the right submandibular gland and adjacent to the right portion of the hyoid bone are found.
However, both the internal jugular and carotid vasculature within the neck enhance normally, with no evidence of filling defects or irregularity.
No suspicious bone lesions are found.
IMPRESSION: Marked edema and stranding of the soft tissues of the anterior neck as described, more prominent on the right side, most consistent with cellulitis/fasciitis in light of the provided history of infectious signs and symptoms.
Possible small, early fluid loculations adjacent to the right submandiblaur gland and right portion of the hyoid bone.
ULTRASOUND OF THE SOFT TISSUES OF THE NECK: There is edema of the strap muscles, which is slightly more conspicuous deep neck soft tissues above the hyoid, without any discrete fluid collections.
IMPRESSION: Edematous changes within the strap muscles in the soft tissues of the right neck, without any discrete fluid collections.
