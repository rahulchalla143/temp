Briefly, this is a 60 year old female with a complex past medical history including hepatitis C, status post liver transplant times two with last transplant complicated by hepatic artery stenosis, status post stent, respiratory failure, status post tracheostomy and multiple transfers to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for secretion management, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus Type 2, hypertension and chronic anasarca.
She was admitted on [**2190-4-13**] to the Medicine Service for mental status changes and hypoxia.
Sputum culture eventually grew out Pseudomonas and multidrug resistant Klebsiella.
She was doing well on the floor until [**2190-5-3**] when she was found lethargic and pulseless.
It was felt that the patient had a PEA arrest secondary to mucous plugging.
Of note she had had increased nasal secretions around her nasogastric tube.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, she was continued on a regimen of deep suctioning and aggressive pulmonary toilet.
General appearance was that of a well developed, obese African American female who is comfortable, mouthing words in no acute distress.
Neck was supple with no masses or lymphadenopathy.
There is no jugulovenous distension.
Lungs had coarse breath sounds anterolaterally with no rhonchi, rales or wheezes.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft with mildly diffuse tenderness, moderately distended.
There were positive normoactive bowel sounds.
No rebound or guarding.
Extremities demonstrated no clubbing or cyanosis but were remarkable for a  3+ lower extremity edema to mid thigh bilaterally.
Of note, the patient also had a 5 by 3 cm sacral decubitus ulcer with necrotic tissue on her lower back.
A chest x-ray from [**2190-5-4**], showed a stable right effusion with patchy left lower lobe lingular infiltrates concerning for pneumonia.
Eventually these organisms would be identified as multidrug resistant Klebsiella and pseudomonas.
ADDENDUM TO HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  respiratory distress/failure - The patient continued to have thick secretions resulting in episodic mucous plugging and respiratory distress.
She was continued on an aggressive regimen of pulmonary toilet with chest physical therapy and suctioning to prevent recurrent plugging.
to avoid pulmonary edema secondary to volume overload and low albumin state.
6 hours with metered dose inhalers as needed for shortness of breath and wheezing.
Pulmonary Service was consulted regarding possible nosocomial pneumonia and right upper chest x-ray demonstrating a left lower lobe and lingular opacity as well as the increased quantity of the patient's sputum.
She underwent a bedside bronchoscopy on [**2190-5-5**] which demonstrated copious thick viscous secretions with purulent appearance.
She had sputum suctioning and pulmonary toilet via the bedside bronchoscopy and then had a repeat bronchoscopy the following day for a BAL and lavage sampling.
The patient's sputum eventually grew out multidrug resistant Klebsiella and Pseudomonas.
Ultimately a plan must be developed between the Liver Staff, Pulmonary Service, and Otorhinolaryngology Service regarding the best way to manage the patient's colonization with Pseudomonas and Klebsiella as well as means of diminishing her mechanical aspiration and recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
As questioned, this was related to her immunosuppressive therapy, however, to rule out thrombosis, she underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasound which demonstrated patency of the portal vein, hepatic vessels and the previously placed hepatic artery stent as well as normal flow.
Sinusitis - While on the Medical Intensive Care Unit, early in this admission, the patient was noted to have increased nasal secretions around her nasogastric tube.
Sacral decubiti - The patient was evaluated by the Plastic Surgery and Wound Care Services with dressing changes per their recommendations.
She was continued on Vitamin C and Zinc for increased wound healing.
Diarrhea - The patient has had a problem with persistent diarrhea during the course of this hospitalization.
It is felt to be likely osmotic in nature as all culture data was negative and the patient demonstrated a dramatic decrease in her level of diarrhea after discontinuation of her tube feeds.
Hypertension - The patient was continued on Lisinopril and Norvasc titrated for blood pressure control.
Diabetes mellitus 2 - She was continued on regular insulin sliding scale with q.i.d.
Tachycardia/bradycardia syndrome - Earlier in this hospitalization the patient was seen by the Cardiology Service.
Anemia - Iron studies demonstrated this to be an anemia of chronic disease.
Pain - The patient experienced significant pain from her sacral decubiti which was treated with Oxycodone.
