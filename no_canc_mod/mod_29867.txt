He suddenly experienced the "worst headache of my life" with associated chest pain.
The patient on admission reported that he did notice a slight hearing deficit (R>L) and his vision seemed blurry to him.
His chest pain has resolved but he still has a moderate residual headache.

Subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage with associated ventricular dilatation  Cerebral angiogram [**2197-1-18**]  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 92127**] underwent cerebral angiography and coil embolization of a 6 x 3.5 mm basilar aneurysm which is pointing superiorly to the right and posteriorly.
There were no complications.
New hypodense area in the left occipital lobe involving the cortex and the adjacent white matter, representing an area of infarction.
Mild narrowing of the distal basilar, the M1 and the A1 and A2 segments on both sides, likely related to a component of vasospasm- better seen on source images.
Decrease in the previously noted subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage.
A tiny outpouching from the left cavernous carotid segment, unchanged.
Patent major intracranial arteries otherwise without focal flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion or new aneurysm.
Non-specific inferior and anterolateral ST-T wave changes.
Unchanged size of left occipital infarct with a slightly more  heterogeneous appearance to the central component.
This suggests possible small petechial changes versus residual enhancement from the contrast given in the CTA performed one day prior.
Small amount of residual subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage without evidence of new hemorrhage.
[**2197-1-23**] ECG Sinus bradycardia with sinus arrhythmia.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Mild Q-T interval prolongation.
Compared to tracing #1 the heart rate has slowed further and sinus arrhythmia is present  [**2197-1-23**] CXR Stidy essentially unchanged.
No evidence of failure or infection.
[**2197-1-24**] ECG Sinus bradycardia a rate of 48 is present.
There is T wave flattening throughout raising a question of electrolyte abnormality or ischemia.
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the evaluated vessels.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**2197-1-27**] CTA Final Report INDICATION: History of basilar tip aneurysm.
CT HEAD: There is a hypodense region in the left occipital lobe which is unchanged from the prior CT and consistent with a subacute infarction.
Areas of hypodensity within the lesion likely represent preserved cortex.
There is mild loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter in the subinsular regions bilaterally, which was present on the initial CT, and likely represents small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no evidence of new infarctions.
A small amount of residual subarachnoid hemorrhage persists, but continues to decrease in amount.
The previously seen intraventricular hemorrhage has also decreased with just a trace amount persisting in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There is no evidence of new hemorrhage.
A coil with metallic artifact is seen in the region of the basilar artery.
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent suggesting mild age-related atrophy.
There is no evidence of mass effect or herniation.
CTA HEAD: Since the prior CTA, there continues to be evidence of vasospasm, which appears to be worsening.
The basilar artery appears slightly thinner.
The right supraclinoid internal carotid artery appears more narrowed than in the prior study.
Worsening vasospasm, specifically in the right supraclinoid ICA, bilateral ACAs, bilateral MCAs, and the basilar artery.
Stable left occipital infarction without evidence of new infarction.
Continued resolution of subarachnoid hemorrhage with no evidence of new hemorrhage.
No new acute hemorrhage or mass effect or hypodense areas.
Redemonstration of the narrowing of the mid and distal basilar artery, anterior and middle cerebral arteries on both sides without significant change compared to the recent study.
On [**1-18**], he underwent an angiogram with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] and a basilar aneurysm was confirmed and coiled without difficulty.
TCDs were performed which showed increased velocities in the distal basilar.
His TCDs showed no spasm.
He was started on steroids for severe headaches.
CTA was done and this did not show vasospasm or hydrocephalus.
On [**1-21**], CTA was done due to worsening headache on steroid and limited upgaze on exam.
This showed no spasm or hydrocephalus.
A later report revealed a left occipital infarct and the patient ocmplained of blurred vision in his right periphery.
Toradol helped with headache on [**1-22**].
He was requiring pressors for BP goals.
He also had mild SOB with some desats.
He continued to have headaches but was neurologically intact.
On [**1-27**] CTA showed diffuse vasospasm and he was transferred to the ICU for further care.
He remained stable with no neurological changes and on [**1-31**] his TCD's were stable and he was transferred to the floor.
