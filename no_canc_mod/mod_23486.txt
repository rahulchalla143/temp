Admission Date:  [**2172-3-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-3-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-11-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: Right sided weakness and facial droop  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy and PEG placement  History of Present Illness: HPI: Mr [**Known lastname 36821**] is a 75 yo M who lives in a senior center who was found in his room this evening with 'paresis' of his right arm and leg, right facial droop and garbled speech.
Upon arrival, BP still high 180-190 sytolic, he was somnolent, noted to have left sided gaze preference, right hemiplegia and was intubated and sedated.
He suffered a pelvic fracture, multiple vertebral and transverse process fractures and a basilar skull fracture.
He also reportedly had bilateral frontal contusions.
In [**2170-5-6**] he suffered a hemorrhagic stroke.
CT scan at that time showed intraventricular hemorrhage, without obvious intraparenchymal source.
He also had evidence of both left thalamic and right internal capsule lacunar infarct.
In [**1-/2171**] he again fell, and this time was taken to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital, where he was found to have a humeral neck fracture.
He did have a head CT at that time, which showed no new insults.
He was last seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**4-/2171**], at which time he was noted to be conversant, but impulsive, with mild dementia.
He was not noted to have any focal motor deficits.
Medications on admission (verified with his nursing home): -Aspirin 81mg -Flomax 0.4mg -Lisinopril 20mg -Metformin 850mg [**Hospital1 **] -Simvastatin 10mg -B12 injections monthly   Past Medical History: HTN, Diabetes, hyperlipidemia Hx of fall w/traumatic SAH and frontal contusions Hx of prior IPH   Social History: Lives at [**Location 70637**] Place  Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: O: T:98.6 BP:188/99  HR:70 R:16   O2Sats:98% 100% CMV mode  Gen: Intubated, not responding to verbal commands, withdraws to pain and winces to sternal rub.

Measured in a similar fashion on prior study, this hematoma measured 1.9 x 3.8 cm, consistent with slight interval enlargement.
There is minimal surrounding parenchymal edema.
There is mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle, with compression of the body and the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**], but there is no significant shift of midline structures.
The basal and perimesencephalic cisterns are preserved, without evidence for herniation.
There is no evidence for intraventricular extension, as suggested in the requisition.
There is no subarachnoid hemorrhage identified.
There is extensive periventricular white matter hypodensity, compatible with the sequelae of chronic small vessel infarction.
There are no abnormal extra-axial fluid collections.
There are extensive calcifications involving the anterior and posterior circulation.
There is minimal surrounding parenchymal edema, and mass effect upon the adjacent lateral ventricle, without significant midline shift or evidence of herniation.
There is no intraventricular extension.
There is underlying global atrophy and chronic small vessel infarction.
There are extensive vascular calcifications of the anterior and posterior circulations.
NCHCT ([**3-13**]) FINDINGS: Again visualized is a 4.5 x 2.2 cm measuring left basal ganglia hematoma with surrounding edema, unchanged from prior exam.
No intraventricular hemorrhage and no new sites of intracranial hemorrhage.
The basal cisterns are normal without evidence of herniation.
No shift of normally midline structures.
No evidence of acute infarctions.
Unchanged chronic lacunar infarcts in the left thalamus and right basal ganglia.
Unchanged confluent hypodensities in the centrum semiovale, periventricular and bifrontal deep and subcortical white matter consistent with sequelae of chronic small vessel disease.
Extensive vascular calcifications of the anterior and posterior circulation.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged left basal ganglia hemorrhage with surrounding edema and effacement of the left lateral ventricle.
No evidence of midline shift or new sites of hemorrhage.
Right upper lobe consolidation which developed on [**3-21**] has progressed.
Severe right lower lobe consolidation that developed two days earlier is stable.
Left lower lobe consolidation is worsening.
Whether the lower lobe abnormalities are pneumonia or atelectasis is radiographically indeterminate.
Moderate right pleural effusion and pulmonary vascular congestion are increasing suggesting an element of cardiac decompensation.
Heart size is top normal and modest distention of mediastinal veins could be a function of supine positioning.
No pneumothorax.

Discharge Labs:  141 | 104 | 38 ---------------< 145 4.1 |  28 | 1.3  Ca: 8.3 Mg: 2.1 PO4: 3.0         10.8 16.1 >------< 333        31.8  Vancomycin trough: 35.1   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known firstname 449**] [**Known lastname 36821**] is a 75 year old man with a history of HTN, HLD, DM and prior IPH presenting with right sided weakness and garbled speech.
He had a non-contrast head CT which showed a 2.2x4.5 cm left basal ganglia hemorrhage.
Given his history of poorly controlled hypertension, recorded blood pressures as high as 220/120, and the location of the hemorrhage, it was thought most likely that this represented a hypertensive hemorrhage.
Exam on discharge was notable for flaccid paralysis on the right, but he will localize to painful stimuli on the right with his left hand.
Lower extremities were anti-gravity on the left, and withdrawal from pain on the right, with upgoing toes bilaterally.
#CV: On admission Mr. [**Known lastname 36821**] was found to have significantly elevated blood pressure.
He was intermittently placed on a labetalol drip, however due to bradycardia this periodically had to be stopped, and he was eventually brought under control with hydralazine instead.
However, given slightly worsening renal failure, he was transitioned from lisinopril to amlodipine and also started on PO hydralazine.
A lipid panel showed significant elevation in triglycerides, but with normal cholesterol, so his simvastatin was increased and he was also started on fish oil.
He was initially extubated on [**3-14**], but then had to be reintubated due to respiratory fatigue.
On [**3-20**] he was noted to have continued respiratory failure, with significant difficulty clearing his secretions, and on [**3-21**] the decision was made to place a trach and PEG.
He continues to require frequent suctioning for secretions, with signs of right sided aspiration pneumonia, however his most recent chest x-ray is showing signs of improvement.
#ID: On [**3-16**] he developed a fever of 101.
CXR showed a small degree of atelectasis, but no pneumonia.
On [**3-20**] CXR showed significant aspiration pneumonia for which he was started on vanc/cipro/cefepime to continue through [**3-29**].
His WBC was slightly increased at 16.1 on [**3-25**], however he remains afebrile and cultures have so far been negative.
He has not had loose stools, and did not have any bowel movements to test for c diff today, however this should be kept in mind, particularly if he develops any loose stools in the next few days.
This was thought to possibly be due to the lisinopril with an element of renal artery stenosis, as well as some degree of overdiuresis.
The lisinopril was stopped, and diuresis was minimized, with slight improvement.

You were found to have a large basal ganglia hemorrhage, which was thought to be secondary to hypertension.
You were also found to have an aspiration pneumonia for which you were started on antibiotics, to be continued through [**3-29**].
