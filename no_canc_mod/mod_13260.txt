Admission Date: [**2164-3-5**]        Discharge Date: [**2164-3-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-3-9**]        Sex:  F  Service:  NSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 35-year-old woman who was sent her primary care doctor because she was told that she had a 4-mm left ophthalmic artery aneurysm.
The patient has a significant medical history of fibromyalgia and migraines, and over the last two weeks has had two episodes of bilateral central vision loss lasting 24 hours, and she was only able to see with her peripheral vision.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No headache.
No visual disturbances currently.
No chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain problems.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for migraines three times per week and fibromyalgia associated with increased lymph nodes and low-grade temperatures.
Chronic neck, shoulder, and back pain after falling down a flight of stairs eight years ago.
She also has a history of a disc herniation at L4- L5.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for inguinal hernia repair a year ago, right breast benign tumor removal, and unspecified left shoulder surgery.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother alive with diabetes and pancreatitis.
Awake and an in no acute distress.
The extremities showed no edema.
She had no drift.
Motor examination showed her to be [**5-31**] throughout the upper and lower extremities with the exception of left triceps which were [**5-1**], and this was secondary to her shoulder surgery and chronic pain.
She underwent a cerebral angiogram on [**2164-1-4**] that showed a 6*5 mm medially pointing right ICA aneurysm of the right internal carotid artery with a superiorly-pointing dome which was projection in to the intradural space.
She then had formal visual field testing as well as a General Surgery consultation for a question of right inguinal hernia.
General Surgery did see the patient and did not feel that she had a recurrent inguinal hernia and did not feel it would interfere with the planned procedure.
Neurology also recommended followup with Endocrinology as an outpatient for her hirsutism and menstrual disorder.
It was felt that the transient central visual disturbances were likely related to her migraines and not the ophthalmic aneurysm.
She was seen by Ophthalmology who also felt that if the ophthalmic aneurysm was responsible for the visual changes it would have caused a unilateral decrease in vision rather than bilateral.
There was no hematoma at the groin site, and she had a good dorsalis pedis pulse.
