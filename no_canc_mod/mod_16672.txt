The patient also had mildly altered mental status.
On presentation to the Emergency Department, the patient had a lithium level of 3.3, an increased creatinine to 5.2, and a chest x-ray with left lower lobe infiltrate, as well as a white blood cell count of 28.
She was also treated with Levaquin and Flagyl, and on transfer to the Medicine Service was day number three for aspiration pneumonia coverage.
Currently, the patient had no complaints except excessive thirst.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Father with a history of bipolar disorder.
Neck examination was difficult to assess secondary to body habitus.
No lesions and no exudates.
Pulmonary examination revealed scattered rhonchi with a few expiratory wheezes bilaterally.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.
No calf tenderness.
Positive Quinton catheter in the left groin which was clean, dry, and intact with no tenderness and no erythema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray on [**10-28**] (since the previous study) revealed development of bilateral pulmonary congestion.
A chest x-ray from [**10-26**] showed an increased density in the left lower base.
ASSESSMENT:  The patient is a 46-year-old female with bipolar disorder who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**10-26**] for ataxia, lithium toxicity, acute renal failure, and pneumonia now with stable lithium levels status post hemodialysis.
The Psychiatry attending continued to see the patient throughout her hospitalization, and lithium was not restarted until [**11-3**] in the evening at a reduced dose of 300 mg by mouth twice per day to adjust for her renal failure.
The patient will have to have lithium levels monitored every four days after discharge to insure that the patient does not have toxic levels of lithium with her increased creatinine.

On transfer to the Medicine Service, the patient seemed improved and no longer manifested any dysmetria or gait ataxia.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient had an increased creatinine on admission of 5.2; which, on transfer to the Medicine Service, had initially been trending downward to 3 but then climbed again to 3.4 and 3.7.
