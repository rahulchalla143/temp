He was intubated, afterwhich he underwent a CT of the head, which showed a small parenchymal hemorrhage in the R anterior inferior frontal lobe.
He was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible meningitis, and had an LP which had pink cloudy fluid, containing 4500 RBCs and 6 WBCs.
He is minimally communicative, primarily responding with 'thumbs-up' or 'thumbs-down'.
He has very poor short-term memory, and will call everyone 'dear' as he does not remember any names.
He has had seizures for at least 10 years, which consist of generalized tonic-clonic activity, lasting 2-10 minutes, followed by a period of post-ictal confusion.

(Stable when compared to OSH CT) # CT Head ([**2103-6-25**]): * Stable right frontal hemorrhagic contusion; improving right parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage collections.
* Stable left and bifrontal lobe hypodensities likely representing old infarct.
# CT Head ([**2103-7-4**]): * No areas of new hemorrhage or evidence for new infarct.
* Interval improvement in right frontal hemorrhagic contusion.
* Trace subarachnoid hemorrhage unchanged.
Previously noted encephalomalacia unchanged.
OTHER IMAGING STUDIES # CT C-spine ([**2103-6-23**]): * No acute fractures or alignment abnormalities.
* Multilevel degenerative changes causing moderate canal stenosis at C3-C4 and C4-C5.
* Osseous density adjacent to the C7 spinous process tip, possibly reflecting an old fracture or ossification of the nuchal ligament.
* Rounded lucencies within the cervical vertebral bodies, particularly C2 and C4 may be secondary to degenerative changes, or possibly representative of atypical hemangiomas, but myeloma or lytic metastases are not excluded and clinical correlation is recommended.
# CTA head/neck ([**2103-6-24**]): * Areas of intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhages described above, the one in the right temporal region, mildly increased compared to the prior study as described and new areas noted in the right parietal/frontal location,new/more obvious.
* Patent major intracranial arteries, as described above without evidence of aneurysm or AV malformation.
* Any small vascular lesions located within the areas of hemorrhage themselves and obscured, cannot be assessed on the present study.
* Bilateral prominent extra-axial CSF spaces, not grossly changed compared to the most recent study.
# CXR ([**2103-6-25**]): changes consistent with aspiration PNA # CXR ([**2103-6-30**]): clear.
No evidence of PNA   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 83442**] is a 51 year-old man with a past medical history including hepatits C, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and seizure disorder admitted with frontal heomorrhage and small traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage after a presumed fall and was found to have evidence of a right lower extremity cellulitis.
# Mental Status The patient was initially admitted to the ICU for intensive monitoring.
Seroquel was held due to concern for neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
The etiology of the patient's presenting symptom of unresponsiveness is likely related to the underlying seizure disorder, resultant fall to the ground, and associated head trauma.
The cellulitic infection could have served as a precipitant for seizure.
Another explanation for the change in mental status is a worsening of baseline encephalopathy in the setting of febrile illness.
The change was associated with the clenching and uncle[**Name (NI) 83443**] of the right hand and trembling of the lower lip.
Clinical examination revealed new anisicoria with a left pupil larger than the right.
The pupillary finding could be related to seizure activity.
No further episodes were noted.
# Falls Throughout the hospitalization, seizure and fall precautions were enacted to protect the patient against potential injury.
CT scans demonstrated no new hemorrhage; in fact, repeat images supported interval improvement in the frontal contusion noted at the time of admission.
* Right Lower Extremity Cellulitis: Initial clinical examination was notable for a circumferential area of blanching erythema in the right lower extremity from the medial malleolus to the level of tibial tuberosity.
A right lower extremity venous duplex study showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
The lesion was thought to be consistent with a cellulitis.
In the course of treatment, the margins of the cellulitis receded.
* Possible Aspiration Pneumonia: At the time of transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was intubated with an elevated temperature and white blood cell count as noted above.
A chest x-ray was thought to show changes consistent with aspiration pneumonia.

Disp:*30 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*  PLEASE NOTE THE SEROQUEL DOSE WAS DECREASED TO 100 mg po qhs  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] rehab hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Frontal Contusion in the Setting of presumed Fall Small traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage Seizure Disorder Alcoholic Dementia (Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome) Cellulitis of the Right Lower Extremity - resolving Remote left frontal infarct   Discharge Condition: Per report, the patient is at his baseline.
Neurologic examination is notable for orientation limited to self and general location 'hospital,' dysarthric, non-fluent language with anomia, subtle anisicoria (left pupil > right), right facial droop, generalized hyperreflexia, and stable right hemiparesis.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after having been found to be unresponsive in your group home.
Imaging studies revealed some bruising in the front part of your brain.
You also have evidence of a skin infection in your right lower leg.
The infection could have helped cause a seizure or simply worsen your baseline mental status.
* In the setting of a seizure disorder and confusion, please do not drive.
* Please seek medical attention if you develop increased confusion, increased seizure frequency or duration, an expansion of the area of redness in your right lower leg, high fever, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or any other symptom you find concerning.
