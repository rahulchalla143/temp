There is brain atrophy as indicated by enlarged sulci and cisterns, but the marked enlargement of the ventricles and appearance of the third ventricle indicates superimposed hydrocephalus.
Small amount of adjacent subarachnoid hemorrhage is present within the right parietal lobe.
More chronic changes are also present including periventricular white matter hypodensities representing the sequela of chronic small vessel infarction, a previous left frontal infarct, and prior lacunar infarcts bilaterally in the basal ganglia.
Underlying neoplasm and ischemia cannot be excluded for the above findings.
5-mm left frontoparietal convexity high density, (likely hemorrhagic) Underlying neoplasm and ischemia cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 83y/o woman with dementia who presented with right thalamic hemorrhage and left frontoparietal convexity focus (unclear if neoplasm, ischemia, or bleed).
Considering her etiology, and current and BP at OSH (SBP 140's) differential diagnosis included hypertensive versus amyloid bleed.
PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia suggested possibility of ischemia at left frontal lobe, but considering large bleeding, aspirin was held.
She was treated for a urinary tract infection with Ciprofloxacin.
Patient was doing when when on morning of [**8-19**] patient had increased difficulty breathing.
Concern was for aortic dissection given unusual pattern of calcification of the aortic arch on CXR.

She expired from respiratory failure on [**2104-8-20**].
