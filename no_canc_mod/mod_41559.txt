Admission Date:  [**2141-1-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2141-1-29**]   Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is an 83 year old lady with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation and recent placement of a biventricular pacemaker on [**2141-1-19**].
At that time, the patient had a fall while going to the bathroom, during which she reports she slipped on the tile and fell onto her back.
The patient denied any loss of consciousness, dizziness, palpitations or head trauma.
In addition, she denied fevers, chills, cough, rashes, shortness of breath, and chest pain.
In the Emergency Department, the patient had a chest x-ray which showed near complete opacification in the left hemithorax with mild shift of the trachea and mediastinum to the right.
It showed a high attenuation of fluid filling the left hemithorax.
There was minimal linear scarring in the right posterior medial lung base.
These findings were suggestive of a large left hemithorax which reaches a slightly higher attenuation in the apex, suggesting a bleed adjacent to this location.
However, there was no clear active extravasation at this site.
There was also a small hematoma visualized adjacent to the pacemaker insertion site.
Congestive heart failure.
The left and right atrium were mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was mildly depressed.
There was mild to moderate 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe 3+ tricuspid regurgitation.
A small to moderate sized pericardial effusion was visualized.
There was no evidence of tamponade.
Atrial fibrillation.
General:  Pleasant, elderly lady, lying in bed, in no acute distress.
Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm; soft; 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the base.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the left base.
Extremities:  1+ edema of the ankles bilaterally.
The patient was found to have a large, left sided hemothorax on CT scan.
There was almost immediate drainage of 2.7 liters of serosanguinous fluid.
The patient was hypotensive on admission with systolic blood pressures in the 90's.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Acute renal failure.
The patient had acute renal failure on admission to the hospital.
This was thought to be secondary to dehydration.
The patient developed diarrhea on the evening of [**2141-1-26**].
Question whether her falls are mechanical in nature, as the patient describes or secondary to possible orthostatic hypotension.
