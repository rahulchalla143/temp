No PTX appreciated.
small Lt pleural effusion persists.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-10**], the left IJ sheath has been removed and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Opacification at the left base is consistent with effusion and atelectasis, which is more prominent than on the right.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Mildly dilated descending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Moderate thickening of mitral valve chordae.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2109-1-29**] no significant change.
He was transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative management.
In the first twenty four hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without complications.
