He denies seeing any bright red blood, denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness.
He does say that since his recent hospitalization when his PPI was discontinued he has had some heart burn symptoms that previously had been well controlled on [**Hospital1 **] omeprazole.
At his PCP's office he had melanotic stool in the vault, so he was referred into the [**Hospital1 18**] ER.
He denies ever having an episode similar to this in the past, he has had episodes of BRBPR with clots due to his history of radiation proctitis/colitis which were very different from this episode.
Currently he drinks about [**1-4**] black russians per week, and says that his primary care doctor has not mentioned any liver problems to him recently.
His exam was notable for guaiac positive black stool in the rectal vault, and an NG lavage cleared with 800cc's of saline.
On arrival to the MICU, he denied any pain, says that he has not had any further dark bowel movements and denies any current acid reflux symptoms.

General Appearance: Well nourished, No acute distress Eyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic Cardiovascular: irregularly irregular, no murmurs/rubs/gallops Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Present), (Left radial pulse: Present), (Right DP pulse: Present), (Left DP pulse: Present) Respiratory / Chest: (Expansion: Symmetric), (Breath Sounds: decreased at the bases L>R Abdomen: +BS, soft, palpable liver edge Extremities: Right lower extremity edema: Trace, Left lower extremity edema: Trace Skin:  Warm Neurologic: Attentive, Follows simple commands, Responds to: Verbal stimuli, Oriented (to): person, place, time , Movement: Purposeful, .
Given patient's history of cirrhosis, an MRI is recommended for further characterization of this lesion and to exclude malignancy.
Right pleural effusion.
CXR [**2117-4-22**]: Interval development of mild pulmonary edema with stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
EGD [**2117-4-22**]: Ulcer in the lower third of the esophagus No evidence of esophageal varices or active bleeding Blood in the antrum No evidence of gastric varices, portal gastropathy, ulcers or active bleeding Ulcers in the duodenum Blood in the first part of the duodenum and second part of the duodenum No evidence of duodenal varices Polyps in the fundus Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum .
New small bilateral pleural effusions when compared to chest CT from [**2117-3-17**].
Cirrhotic liver with sequelae of portal hypertension including splenomegaly and trace of perihepatic ascites with no evidence for intra-abdominal varices.
Hypoenhancing lesion adjacent and posterior to the intrahepatic IVC at the dome of the liver with imaging characteristics consistent with w hemangioma.
No lesion identified to correlate to that seen within the left lobe of the liver on prior ultrasound of [**2117-4-21**], but most likely represents a regenerative nodule.
No liver lesion seen concerning for HCC.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Admission: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 y/o M with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, GERD with recent discontinuation of his PPI, atrial fibrillation on coumadin who presents with melanotic stools and a three point HCT drop over the past two weeks.
Active Problems: .
# GI Bleed: Melanotic stool and positive NG lavage both consistent with upper source of bleeding.
There was no evidence of varicies.
His coumadin was initially held, but was restarted prior to discharge given history of CVA off anticoagulation.
There was no evidence of recurrent bleeding and on the day of d/c, INR was 2.1 and his HCT had remained stable.
BM the day of discharge was brown without BRB or melena.
# Alcoholic Cirrhosis: Per patient his PCP has not mentioned any liver dysfunction concerns recently, liver architecture on RUQ U/S was consistent with cirrhosis, no evidence of synthetic dysfunction, and no varcies on EGD.
# Hypoechoic liver lesion: Noted on RUQ u/s.
Given patient's history of cirrhosis, an MRI was recommended for further characterization to exclude malignancy.
CT findings showed likely hemangioma, but lesion noted on ultrasound was not seen on CT, thought possibly due to a regenerative nodule.
His AFP was reassuring at 4.1 and there was nothing concerning for HCC seen on CT. .
At the time of d/c his INR was 2.1; he was sent home on 1mg Warfarin daiily with instructions to have his INR checked [**4-29**] during his PCP f/u appointment.
His home metoprolol was initially held in the setting of GI bleed and restarted prior to discharge.
# DOE/Pleural Effusions: Pt complained of mild DOE, most recent CXR with moderate effusions, echo on last admission with normal systolic function and no evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
Repeat CXR on this admission showed some increased pulmonary edema and was given lasix with improvement in his symptoms .
# Hypertension: Initially held home antihypertensive regimen of losartan 50mg daily, nifedipine 30mg daily and metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 **] in the setting of his GI bleed.
Chronic Problems: .
# Peripheral neuropathy: - Cont home gabapentin .
# OSA on CPAP: - Used autoset CPAP while in house .
Transitional issues: -Pt needs close follow up of INR and Hct to ensure stability given recent bleed and known ulcers.
- lasix 20mg prn lower extremity edema - simvastatin 20mg daily   Discharge Medications: 1.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Peptic Ulcer Disease Secondary Diagnosis: Cirrhosis HTN   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had an endoscopy, which showed ulcers in your esophagus and duodenum.
You also were found to have a mass in your liver.
For this, you had a CT scan, which showed no evidence of cancer.
However, you should see a specialist for ongoing management of your liver disease.
