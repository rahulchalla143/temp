She presents with a presyncopal episode.
The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2123-12-5**] which demonstrated an increased peak aortic gradient of 77 mmHg.
The patient subjectively reports progressive fatigue and mild dyspnea on exertion times several months.
No shortness of breath, chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea.

Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.

Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, without masses or organomegaly.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed no acute process.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for semi-elective aortic stenosis repair.
They also remarked that postoperative bleeding may be a significant complication.
