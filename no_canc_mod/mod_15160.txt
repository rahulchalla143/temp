Presented to ED w/ severe [**9-4**] epigastric pain radiating to back.
Admitted to ED with suspected severe pancreatitis recurrence.
Imaging revealed uncomplicated pancreatitis.
He was initially planned to be admitted to the floor, but then CXR showed new pulmonary edema, and there was concern over giving iv fluids on the floor and so Mr. [**Known lastname 51051**] was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring and treatment.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course included: -Aggresive IVF and dilaudid PCA for pain control -Increasing abdominal distension, pt passing flatus, NGT was placed for decompression which he self-dc'd c/o severe discomfort.
On [**11-11**] in a.m. of admission to main team on floor, he c/o very little abd pain ([**1-4**] epigastric), was able to ambulate w/o difficulty and Foley to d/c'ed; requesting PO intake.
Atrial fibrillation- Pt developed atrial fibrillation approximately twelve years ago.
Coronary artery disease- Pt is s/p one vessel CABG from the LIMA to the LAD on [**2121-10-17**].
He has not had any further stress tests since that time.
Pancreatitis- First episode of pancreatitis was in [**2103**].
He reports that his current pain is epigastric when in the past his "pancreatitis" pain was more localized to his left lower abdomen/flank.
However, there is a record of an episode of DTs at an OSH in [**2119**].
Hypertriglyceridemia 6.
Hypertension 7.
Spinal stenosis 9.
MRSA infection- Pt had a MRSA PNA at an OSH when he was intubated during an episode of pancreatitis.
He had a sputum positive for MRSA here at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2120**].

Anicteric sclera.
Pulm- Decreased bibasilar breath sounds with faint wheezes at R base.
No rales or rhonchi.
Mildly tender to palpation in epigastric region while not complaining of significant pain.
No rebound tenderness or guarding.
Genital: Diminished penile and scrotal edema from before Neuro- CN II-XII intact.

No complication seen on abdominal CT.
He initially had prerenal azotemia and was bolused, urine output fully recovered by day of discharge.
- Able to tolerate PO clears by day prior to discharge, no epigastric pain reported on discharge on [**11-12**], able to ambulate well.
- Had some minor non-bloody diarrhea night before discharge perhaps s/p stool softeners and laxatives; K repleted and bowel regimen d/c'ed.
# Low Grade Fever: - Initial suspicion of ?
aspiration pneumonia based on CXR w/ RUL infiltrates but CXR gradually resolved over course of stay.
- Continued w/ some low grades temps and fever until day prior to admission when temp fully normalized.
# Pulmonary edema: - Found to be volume overloaded on exam and by CXR early in stay, perhaps s/p aggressive initial rehydration in wake of prerenal azotemia on admission.
- TTE showed normal EF and no sign of diastolic dysfunction but sub-optimal windows.
# Wheezes on Lung Exam: - No prior hx of such wheezes.
- Could be due to volume overload, but could also be from metoprolol.
Given hypertension and tachycardia on admission, treated with diazepam 10iv x 1 and monitored throughout.
- On [**11-11**] he had a ?
withdrawal picture pulling out IV and becoming somewhat agitated in late afternoon, mildly diaphoretic.
However, though hypertensive in both cases of agitation, he had no tachycardia.
Seemed frustrated with situation but aware and no indication of MS changes or confusion.
Likely from saline repletion; gap resolved by end of admission w/ no indication of acidosis.
- Ruled out for MI x three sets of cardiac enzymes.
HTN continued to be a problem during stay and he spiked to 170s on [**11-11**] afternoon and up to 180 on [**11-12**] midnight.
Atrial fibrillation- He has a long history of atrial fib but is not anticoagulated.
# Low Hct:  Apparently hemodilution, stable throughout hospitalization to baseline for him, though may benefit from further work-up.
# Glucose control - No known h/o diabetes, but continued with a sliding scale during hospitalization, QID FS.
# Communication- With Mr. [**Known lastname 51051**] and family members.
Disp:*30 Tablet Sustained Release 24HR(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Recurrence of acute pancreatitis in the setting of labile blood pressure, apparent EtOH withdrawal w/o frank DT (on CIWA protocol)   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please call a physician if you experience sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, high fever, seizures, severe headache, fainting, severe and prolonged confusion, or rapid and substantial weight loss.
Followup Instructions: Please see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 51052**] at your already scheduled time on Monday [**2123-11-15**]; please mention that your blood pressure became high late in your hospitalization (to 180/100) and this is why we have increased your Accupril dose to 20 milligrams per day.
Please mention also that your potassium became low (to 3.0) on your day of discharge after you'd had some diarrhea the night before, and that we repleted your potassium.
To PCP:  [**Name10 (NameIs) 357**] consider ordering pulmonary function tests for Mr. [**Known lastname 51051**] as PE and CXR both seem to indicate substantial difficulty in deep inhalation.
No indication of pulmonary fibrosis from amiodarone but ?
