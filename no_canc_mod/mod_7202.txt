She also expressed concern about weight gain and pedal edema.
She was eventually diuresed at outside hospital, but was found to have elevated creatinine and was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for management.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Polycystic kidney disease.
In general, the patient is an obese African American female who appears to be in mild distress.
Neck supple, nontender without lymphadenopathy.
Lungs decreased at the bilateral bases.
Extremities 2+ pedal edema bilaterally.
IMAGING:  Chest x-ray performed on admission demonstrated a globular appearing cardiac silhouette with small bilateral effusions and an overall picture concerning for pericardial effusion.
This drained approximately 1 liter in the immediate period and she therefore underwent a pericardial window procedure on [**2162-1-8**] for persistent fluid reaccumulation.
The patient did well, but developed a temperature spike on postoperative day six along with increased shortness of breath.
The patient did have another temperature spike to 103.6 and was subsequently found to have MRSA bacteremia.
This finding was consistent with endocarditis.
Per their recommendations, the patient was treated with Levofloxacin for gram negative coverage along with Vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia and presumed endocarditis.
She was also on Valcyte for a positive CMV antibody titer.
Around this time the patient developed severe right hip pain permitting her from ambulating.
An MRI was performed, which was negative for infection, but did show mild degenerative joint disease.
The patient was focally tender over the greater trochanter area and an orthopedic consultation was therefore obtained for possible trochanteric bursitis.
The patient was therefore treated with aggressive physical therapy and was seen by the acute pain service.
An MRI was obtained to rule out radiculopathy, which was negative.
She was treated with Tylenol #3 with Percocet for breakthrough pain and is scheduled to see the pain service as an outpatient.
During her hospitalization, a biopsy of the transplant kidney was performed, which was negative for rejection.
After remaining afebrile for greater then 48 hours the patient was discharged to rehab for physical therapy and intravenous antibiotics.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Polycystic kidney disease status post cadaveric renal transplant.
Pericardial effusion status post pericardial window procedure.
The patient was also instructed to follow up if she had fevers greater then 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, intractable vomiting or any other questions or concerns.
