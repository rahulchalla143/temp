Sources of infection included sacral decubitus ulcer (not extending to bone, draining, or tender/erythematous), L AKA stump (well-healed, though had history of VRE), R foot ulcer (tender to palpation, not draining), or pulmonary (given CXR and exam evidence for multifocal PNA and history of choking/cough while eating).
Initial blood cultures on [**2123-6-21**] were 1/2 bottles positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters and pairs (speciation revealed staph epi), felt to likely be contaminant.
Cultures from tip of PICC line removed on [**6-21**] at nursing home revealed gram-negative rods, but NO blood cx were positive.
TSH was mildly elevated at 4.4.
Respiratory: Patient denied respiratory symptoms throughout, including cough, SOB, or pleuritic chest discomfort.
CXR on [**6-24**] had improving consolidations and decrease in bilateral pleural effusions as seen on CXR at admission.
Infiltrates were thought to be consistent with pneumonia overlain on pulmonary congestion from CHF.
Speech and swallow recommended nectar thick liquids and thick/ground consistency diet given concern for aspiration.
Cardiovascular: Patient was ruled out for MI by 3 sets cardiac enzymes and placed on ASA, statin.
BB was held [**1-13**] initial hypotension and question of septic physiology.
Rhythm was normal sinus throughout, with unifocal PVCs > 10/hr on telemetry, with no other concerning EKG changes.
BNP was 1800; echocardiogram demonstrated EF 50% with evidence of increased LVEDP, pulmonary hypertension and 3+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was titrated up on captopril for afterload reduction, and switched to lisinopril on discharge.
Renal/FEN: Acute renal failure with creatinine 1.2 up from baseline 0.5.
Initial FeNa was 0.8% consistent with pre-renal etiology from dehydration [**1-13**] poor PO intake and infection versus CHF.
Speech and swallow consultation performed for concern for aspiration, given history and multifocality of CXR, with evidence of no gag reflex; placed on mechanical soft diet.
UTI: On discharge, complained of some urinary urgency, thought to mechanical (from foley) or infectious.
Patient will also need restarting terasozin as outpatient for BPH, which may aid with BP/afterload management.
Heme: Initial studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease (Fe low, TIBC low, Ferritin elevated), but difficult to interpret in setting of acute illness.
Would repeat as outpatient and consider iron therapy.
