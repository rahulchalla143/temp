Admission Date:  [**2180-9-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-10-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2126-2-25**]       Sex:  F  Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 54 year old female with past medical history significant for a prior cholecystectomy who was admitted with complaints of right upper quadrant pain for about a week.
The pain had been initially intermittent and aching in quality with no radiation or associated nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills or changes in bowel movement.
She then went home to return to the Emergency Department on [**9-29**] with severe unrelenting pain that had prevented her from sleeping the night before.
She also noted that the pain now radiated somewhat to her right scapula and right arm, similar to the pain that she had felt prior to her cholecystectomy.
At the time of admission, the patient noted that she was constipated and still had some nausea, but no vomiting and denied any fever or chills.
The patient was admitted for work-up of right upper quadrant pain and pain control.
Basal cell carcinoma status post resection.
Acute pancreatitis times one.
Cerebrovascular accident secondary to carbon dioxide embolus.
Esophageal spasm.
History of multiple miscarriages.
FAMILY HISTORY:   The patient's mother died at age 82 of ovarian cancer.
The patient's father died at 31 secondary to a myocardial infarction.
The patient has one brother with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, and a son with hypercholesterolemia.
On admission, a chest x-ray revealed surgical clips in the right upper quadrant with no acute cardiopulmonary disease.
She also had a right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed a dilated common bile duct at 7 to 8 millimeters; no intrahepatic ductal dilatation; no obvious stone.
CT scan findings from [**9-28**] showed no acute appendicitis or pancreatitis.
There was no obvious free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
In general, this was a thin, pleasant well groomed female in no apparent distress.
Neck showed no jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.
Heart examination was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops and a normal S1 and S2.
Abdomen was soft, nondistended, good bowel sounds; no hepatosplenomegaly.
Tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant; negative [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign.
Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Right upper extremity notable for to biopsy sites performed by her dermatologist.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service for further evaluation of her right upper quadrant abdominal pain.
Given the normal findings on right upper quadrant ultrasound and abdominal CT scan, an MRCP was performed which showed two small cysts in the tail of the pancreas, a prominent common bile duct, most likely status post cholecystectomy with no evidence of common bile duct sludge and no evidence of choledocholithiasis.
The Gastrointestinal consultation recommended a formal endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to definitively rule out the possibility of a retained stone in the common bile duct and to further evaluate the pancreatic cyst seen on the MRCP.
The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on Tuesday, [**10-3**]; mild biliary dilatation consistent with previous cholecystectomy.
No evidence of stone or sludge in the biliary duct.
She began to have shaking tremors and was not responsive to verbal stimuli.
On examination she was found to be unresponsive to voice with her pupils equal, round and reactive to light with no vestibular ocular reflex.
She had mild withdrawal to pain in all four extremities.
In summary, the Neurology consultation felt that the patient was slow to recover following sedation for the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and thought that there was a possibility of seizure activity, but that she was recovering from the sedation.
They recommended an EEG the next day, which was normal and showed no evidence of seizure activity.
The patient was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit overnight following this question of seizure activity.
Given the negative work-up to this point, the patient was offered an upper GI series with a small bowel follow through to further evaluate for any obstruction or lesion in the gastrointestinal tract.
When the patient was taken down the next morning to have this study done, scout films revealed that her transverse and descending colon were full of contrast from the prior CT scan, therefore, we were unable to complete the upper gastrointestinal small bowel follow through.
Throughout her hospitalization, the patient noted that her right upper quadrant pain was well controlled with Oxycodone 5 mg every three to four hours as needed and Tylenol 500 mg every six hours standing.
She said that with this pain regimen, her pain which had been an 8 out of 10 was now a 2 out of 10 and very manageable.
The patient did have a bump in her liver function tests status post the ERCP.
Other issues while in the hospital:  The patient was seen by Infectious Disease for question of macrobacterial infection of her right upper arm lesion.
It was felt by the Infectious Disease consultation that her current abdominal pain was not related to a chronic mycobacterial skin infection and the likelihood of a disseminated mycobacterial infection was very rare.
Her pain was well controlled with Oxycodone 5 mg every three to four hours and acetaminophen.
All of her imaging studies were within normal limits with no obvious etiology for abdominal pain.
